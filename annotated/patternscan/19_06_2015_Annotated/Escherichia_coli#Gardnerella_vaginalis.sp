TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == vaginal infections among pregnant women at omdurman maternity hospital in khartoum, sudan.
AB  == introduction: microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. this study  aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. methodology: a cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between august and december 2008 at omdurman maternity hospital, khartoum, sudan. vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct gram smear, nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. statistical analysis was done using spss program version 12.0.1. a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically  significant. results: of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, bv was detected in 49.8%, followed by chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). no significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and c. trachomatis infections was found. gentamicin was the most active agent against gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. clarythromycin was the most active against mycoplasma species. conclusions: pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. such cases may require specific medication. routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in north lebanon.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. this study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of lebanon, between september  2012 and january 2013. from these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. the use of genotypic rep-pcr fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens:  gardnerella vaginalis cip7074t, staphylococcus aureus atcc33862, escherichia coli cip103982, and candida albicans atcc10231. the antagonistic lactobacilli strains  were then identified using 16s rdna sequence. the data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid dna, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with  the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of lactobacillus buchneri 24s8. only lactobacillus mucosae 29s8, enterococcus faecium e21, and e. faecium eac adhered to colonic mucus. probiotic  strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except escherichia coli o8:k88ab:h9 (65), fusobacterium necrophorum, and gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. only kocuria kristinae and g. vaginalis adhered  to uterine body mucus; e. coli o149:k88ac (ec) adhered to colonic mucus. the strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. the ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of gras (generally regarded as safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.

TI  == bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern poland.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of  an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. material and methods: the study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already  given birth to healthy children. the material for the presence of c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, m. genitalium, m. hominis and u. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by pcr. furthermore, bd probetec et system was used to detect c. trachomatis infection. vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. results: u. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of  controls. presence of m. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and c.  trachomatis only in latter (3%). n. gonorrhoeae and m. genitalium were not found  in any of the examined women. the frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. there were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). conclusions: despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. bv develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.

TI  == in vitro probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum sk5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  == a lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. this strain, identified as lactobacillus fermentum sk5, was able to survive at ph 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible  to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. l. fermentum sk5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic escherichia coli and  vaginal pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis. the effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kda, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. further studies revealed that l. fermentum sk5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. this lactobacillus showed coaggregation with e. coli and g. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. the adhesion of l. fermentum sk5 to hela, ht-29 and caco-2 cells and its inhibition of e. coli and g. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. these incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of l. fermentum sk5 that would prevent binding and growth of e. coli and g. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. on the basis of the ability of l. fermentum sk5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it  is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.

TI  == pregnancy-induced changes in immune protection of the genital tract: defining normal.
AB  == objective: both the state of pregnancy as well as disruption of vaginal flora and immune mediators may increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-1 acquisition. the objective of this study was to define immune changes in lower genital and systemic immunity associated with normal pregnancy. study design: this prospective cohort enrolled low-risk pregnant and nonpregnant women ages 18-35 years. pregnant women at <14 weeks and nonpregnant women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were included. cervical and vaginal fluid was collected. concentrations of immune mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods or multiplex immunoassay. samples were inoculated onto various culture media allowing for growth of lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, enterococcus species, anaerobic gram-negative rods, candida, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma species, and mycoplasma hominis. concentrations of immune mediators and vaginal colonization frequencies were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. results: genital tract concentration of interleukin-1beta was higher during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant participants. serum c-reactive protein concentrations were higher in all trimesters of pregnancy. concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor did not differ between groups. lactobacillus was more commonly isolated from vaginal cultures of nonpregnant participants (100% vs 70.2%, p = .02). identification of candida, g vaginalis, m hominis, and s aureus was common  and not different between groups. ureaplasma species was isolated from >60% pregnant participants. conclusion: the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, as well as the systemic marker of inflammation, c-reactive protein, are increased during pregnancy. the impact of these proinflammatory changes during pregnancy deserves further study.

TI  == the microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  == based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (vmb) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., most prominently  lactobacillis crispatus. similarly, the vmb has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (bv) when it is predominated by gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. bv is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. additionally, bv predisposes women to infection by hiv as well as other sexually  transmitted diseases (stds). the application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the vmb has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. it is now clear that the diversity of the vmb is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the new orleans std clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble  to form a recognizable "forest" (vmb). this knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.

TI  == amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  == spontaneous preterm birth (ptb) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) occur more frequently in african-american women than in other racial groups. this may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the  condition. it is also possible that amniotic fluid (af) has different immunomodulatory properties in african-american women that increase their risk of ptb and pprom. to test this, we cultured fetal membranes from european-american and african-american women with sterile medium (control), escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci (gbs), polyporphorans gingivalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum or ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous af. cytokine concentrations were quantified in the  conditioned medium. all bacterial species increased il-8 production. il-1beta and tnf-alpha production were stimulated by lps, e. coli, and g. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to group b streptococci and p. gingivalis were limited to il-1beta and tnf-alpha respectively. genital mycoplasmas stimulated tnf-alpha and il-10 but had no effect on il-1beta production. african-americans had twice the il-1beta response to e. coli as european-americans (p=0.031). conversely, european-americans produced more il-8 in response to lps than african-americans (p=0.026). af had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. these results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. interventions to prevent ptb and pprom may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her af.

TI  == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB  == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection  and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation  in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis  significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI  == preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  == objective: to compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. methods: fetal membranes were obtained after  cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6, il-8, il-1beta and tnf-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-7, mmp-8, mmp-9) were measured in the supernatants using bio-plex, and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). microorganisms  isolated were ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group b streptococci (3), gardnerella vaginalis (1), and escherichia coli (2). we found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. secretion of mmp-1, mmp-8, mmp-9 and pge(2) was significantly higher in infected  women. secretion of il-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. conclusions: almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.

TI  == characterization of low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide from human female  reproductive tract.
AB  == background & objectives: the mechanisms that protect female upper genital tract from ascending infection by microbes present in vagina are only partially understood. it is expected that epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces and their secretions directly interfere with microbial colonization and invasion. this study was aimed to demonstrate the expression of 2 kda antimicrobial peptide which was identified and purified from female genital tract tissues using chromatographic techniques. methods: low molecular weight proteins were isolated  from human female reproductive tract tissues obtained from premenopausal women. antimicrobial activity of these lmw proteins was assessed against different reproductive tract pathogens viz., neisseria gonorrhoeae, group b streptococcus,  gardnerella vaginalis, escherechia coli and candida albicans. the expression of these peptides were also documented in reproductive tract tissues with the help of hyperimmune sera raised against the rabbits. the purified peptide was characterized by n-terminal sequencing. results: immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that 2 kda peptide was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix while it was absent in columnar epithelial cells of upper genital tract. upregulation of the expression  of this peptide was observed in patients of chronic non-specific cervicitis and acute on chronic cervicitis. this purified antimicrobial peptide also showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different reproductive tract pathogens. interpretation & conclusions: considering the emerging bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics, isolation and understanding of the expression of antimicrobial peptides from female reproductive tissue extracts may provide some leads towards the development of strategies for the treatment of reproductive tract infections.

TI  == [the role of infection in preterm birth].
AB  == intrauterine infection could be responsible for 25% up to 40% of preterm births.  this relationship was initially demonstrated using animal models, inducing their  abortion by injecting bacteria or endotoxins. in human research, examination of amniocentesis fluid showed the anteriority of infection over labor induction, and the existence of a subclinical latency phase between these two phenomena. the ascending route is preponderant, and four stages can be distinguished: cervical and vaginal infection, chorio-decidual infection, intra-amniotic infection, fetal infection. the intrauterine infection is very frequent in case of early preterm birth (<30 wg). it is associated with an increase of neurological and pulmonary morbidity. most commonly found bacterial species are mycoplasma species, but also escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus b. several markers of the infection have been studied: a maternal leukocytosis>15,000/mm(3) or a c-reactive protein (crp)>20mg/l, an increase of fibronectin and/or il-6 cervical, a short cervical length especially before 32 wg, a leukocytosis of the amniotic fluid, and/or high interleukin concentrations. the main marker used for the newborn is the crp, but other markers can also be used for an early diagnosis of  an infection, especially interleukin 6.

TI  == generation of recombinant single-chain antibodies neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin, the main virulence factor of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == background: gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the predominant colonist of the vaginal tract in women with bacterial vaginosis. vaginolysin (vly) is a protein toxin released by g. vaginalis. vly possesses cytolytic activity and is considered as a main virulence factor of g. vaginalis. inhibition of vly-mediated cell lysis by antibodies may have important physiological relevance. results: single-chain variable fragments of immunoglobulins (scfvs) were cloned from two hybridoma cell lines producing neutralizing antibodies against vly and expressed  as active proteins in e. coli. for each hybridoma, two variants of anti-vly scfv  consisting of either vl-vh or vh-vl linked with a 20 aa-long linker sequence (g(4)s)(4) were constructed. recovery of scfvs from inclusion bodies with subsequent purification by metal-chelate chromatography resulted in vly-binding proteins that were predominantly monomeric. the antigen-binding activity of purified scfvs was verified by an indirect elisa. the neutralizing activity was investigated by in vitro hemolytic assay and cytolytic assay using hela cell line. calculated apparent kd values and neutralizing potency of scfvs were in agreement with those of parental full-length antibodies. vh-vl and vl-vh variants of scfvs showed similar affinity and neutralizing potency. the anti-vly scfvs derived from hybridoma clone 9b4 exhibited high vly-neutralizing activity both on human erythrocytes and cervical epithelial hela cells. conclusions: hybridoma-derived scfvs with vly-binding activity were expressed in e. coli. recombinant anti-vly scfvs inhibited vly-mediated cell lysis. the monovalent scfvs showed reduced affinity and neutralizing potency as compared to the respective full-length antibodies. the loss of avidity could be restored by generating scfv constructs with multivalent binding properties. generated scfvs is the first example of recombinant single-chain antibodies with vly-neutralizing activity produced in prokaryote expression system. g. vaginalis caused infections continue to be a world-wide problem, therefore neutralizing recombinant antibodies may provide novel therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and other diseases caused by g. vaginalis.

TI  == disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  == the process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly  understood. likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. in order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (bv). uropathogenic escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. challenge of e. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. however, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant e. coli killing. e. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of l. rhamnosus gr-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. similarly challenge of bv biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated bv biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms.  the findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.

AB  == objectives: to identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. methods: the microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. results: semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by escherichia coli and enterococcus sp.  ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and g. vaginalis isolation. semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species  isolated most frequently. in comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of g. vaginalis  and u. urealyticum. conclusions: positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.

TI  == production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against vaginolysin: mapping of a region critical for its cytolytic activity.
AB  == vaginolysin (vly) is a protein toxin released by gardnerella vaginalis. vly belongs to the group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs). we have generated a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against vly. for the generation of mabs, we have used recombinant vly expressed in escherichia coli. the functional activity of recombinant vly was confirmed by an in vitro hemolytic assay using human erythrocytes. the mabs raised against recombinant vly were reactive with vly from g. vaginalis both by western blot and elisa. the cross-reactivity of mabs with other cdcs was investigated. for this purpose, recombinant cytolysins perfringolysin, listeriolysin, intermedilysin, pneumolysin and streptolysin were expressed in e. coli. the mabs were specific exclusively to vly and did not react with other cdcs. all mabs were studied for the ability to neutralize hemolytic activity of vly in vitro and several neutralizing mabs were  identified. the mab produced by clone 9b4 showed the most potent neutralizing activity. the epitope for this mab was localized near the n-terminus of vly, between amino acid (aa) residues 112 and 268. the region recognized by the neutralizing mab 9b4 includes the conserved motif (vaarmqyd, aa 189-196) supposed to be involved in vly oligomerization. selected mabs were employed to develop a sandwich elisa for vly quantification. the mab-based immunoassay was suitable for the detection of vly in the cultures of g. vaginalis. in conclusion, the mabs described in the current study may be useful for structural and functional studies of vly as well as immunodetection of vly in biological specimens.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  == objective: progesterone (p(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. the mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital  tract. we evaluated the effects of p(4) on interleukin-8 (il-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are  commonly associated with preterm birth. methods: vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/ml p(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, or ureaplasma urealyticum. concentrations of il-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by elisa and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. results: e. coli, g. vaginalis and u. urealyticum-stimulated il-8 production for both cell lines. p(4) inhibited basal  and bacteria-stimulated il-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced il-8 production by endocervical cells. p(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. conclusions: p(4) inhibits il-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. although p(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it  also increases their production of il-8.

TI  == effect of sulfasalazine on basal and bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by endocervical epithelial cells.
AB  == problem: sulfasalazine (sasp) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear-factor  kappa b activation and interleukin-8 (il-8) production by cultured explants of placenta, amnion and choriodecidua. bacteria-induced il-8 production in the cervix is a potential mechanism for premature cervical ripening that may lead to  preterm birth. our objective was to determine if sasp inhibits il-8 production by endocervical cells stimulated with bacterial pathogens associated with preterm birth. method of study: human endocervical cells were incubated with 0-1.6 mm sasp and then stimulated with ureaplasma parvum, escherichia coli, or gardnerella vaginalis. conditioned medium was then harvested and production of il-8 was quantified by elisa. viability of the cells was ascertained at the end of the experiment with the mtt-assay. results: at the highest concentration tested (1.6  mm), sasp significantly inhibited il-8 production by cultures stimulated with e.  coli (p < 0.001), u. parvum (p < 0.001), and g. vaginalis (p < 0.001). viability  of the cells, however, was significantly reduced by sasp at 0.8 and 1.6 mm in both the presence and absence of bacteria for all experiments. conclusion: although high concentrations of sasp inhibit il-8 production by cultures of endocervical cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, this  effect may be because of toxicity of the antibiotic on the cells.

TI  == prevotella bivia as a source of lipopolysaccharide in the vagina.
AB  == objectives: to compare vaginal lipopolysaccharides (lps) concentrations between patients with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), to evaluate the correlation between prevotella bivia colonization density and lps concentration, and to determine the impact of lps on loss of dopamine neurons (da). methods: vaginal washes obtained from patients with (n=43) and without (n=59) bv were tested for quantity of p. bivia cells using quantitative pcr and for concentrations of lps using the limulus amebocyte lysate gel clot method. prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and escherichia coli sonicated cell extracts were also tested for lps production. da neuron cells obtained from embryonic day (e) 14.5 pregnant rats were exposed to fluid from eight vaginal washes; tyrosine hydrolase immunoreactive staining was applied for visualization and cell counts. results: the median lps concentrations were dramatically higher among patients who had symptoms of bv compared to those who did not have symptoms (3235.0 vs 46.4 eu/ml, respectively, p<0.001); patients who had bv also had much higher colonization densities of p. bivia (0.06+/-0.36 vs 5.4+/-2.2 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively, p<0.001). prevotella bivia cell lysates resulted in a higher lps concentration (10,713.0+/-306.6 eu/ml) than either e. coli (4679.0+/-585.3 eu/ml) or g. vaginalis (0.07+/-0.01 eu/ml of lps). the loss of da neuron was 20-27% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from bv-negative patients and 58-97% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from patients with bv. conclusion: p. bivia  produces high lps concentration, which may create a toxic vaginal environment that damages da neurons.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == a retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  == background: vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. this study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in greece. material/methods: data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "lito" private obstetric/gynecological hospital, athens, greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. results: during this period, 1632 women were examined. the mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. of the isolates, in  which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) trichomonas vaginalis. less usual isolates were escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus spp., streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus spp., and staphylococcus saprophyticus. conclusions: the authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in greece. ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic greek women included candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and  trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.

TI  == etiologic agents of cervicovaginitis in turkish women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution of microbiologic agents causing cervicovaginitis. methods: we conducted the study between october 2002 and december 2004 in abant izzet baysal university, duzce school of medicine hospital, turkey. the samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix and cervix by swabs in 828 patients. direct microscopic examination, culture and enzyme immune assay (eia) methods were performed in all patients for diagnosis of microbiologic agents. results: gardnerella vaginalis (g. vaginalis) were diagnosed in 254 (30.7%) patients, candida albicans (c. albicans) in 152 (18.4%), candida glabrata (c. glabrata) in 36 (4.3%), candida species in 52 (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) in 62 (7.5%), streptococcus group b in 28 (3.4%), escherichia coli (e. coli) in 42 (5.1%), klebsiella species in 24 (2.9%), and streptococcus group d in 8 (1%) patients in culture. less frequent enterobacteria in 30 (3.6%) were: pseudomonas species, proteus species enterobacter species, hafnia alvei and nonfermenter species. neisseria gonorrheae (n. gonorrheae) was detected in one patient (0.1%) in culture. the chlamydia trachomatis (c. trachomatis) antigen was detected by eia methods in 130 (15.7%) patients and trichomonas vaginalis (t. vaginalis) was observed in 8 (1%) patients by direct microscopic examination. conclusion: performing the etiologic diagnosis of cervicovaginitis is necessary in order to take appropriate therapeutic and preventive measures. therefore, we recommend g. vaginalis, c. albicans and c. trachomatis should be investigated in patients having a diagnosis of cervicovaginitis in our population, since these were detected in a considerable number of cases. additionally, c. glabrata and t. vaginalis should be kept in mind as possible pathogens.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == a cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (bv) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). women (n = 1,140) were ascertained at five us centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. serial vaginal swabs were obtained for gram's stain and cultures. pid was defined as 1)  histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees c, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. the first correlated with bv by gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to  a lesser degree, ureaplasma urealyticum. the second, unrelated to bv by gram's stain, consisted of enterococcus species and escherichia coli. being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of bv-associated microorganisms increased pid  risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). carriage  of non-bv-associated microorganisms did not increase pid risk. women with heavy growth of bv-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). when identified by microbial culture, a combination of bv-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring pid.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an ivf program. patients and methods: microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. results: positive microbial growths were observed from  endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). the clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. the implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (p <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: candida albicans (69 cases), ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), streptococcus b or d (24 cases) and escherichia coli (22 cases). positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (p <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (p <0.01). discussion and conclusion: endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. in this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the ivf treatment.

AB  == very widespread in our clinical setting, early-onset sepsis is due to organisms that commonly colonize or infect the maternal genital tract; identifying such organisms would help improve prevention and treatment. objective: to determine the bacterial ecology and the pathological status of the genital organs during the last trimester of pregnancy, in order to evaluate the risk of materno-fetal infections and to improve the present prophylactic measures based on monitoring bacterial carriage during the first trimester. method: vaginal and endocervical samples, usually taken during the first trimester of pregnancy were delayed and taken during the last trimester of pregnancy, in patients with no signs of sepsis and not taking antibiotics. a macroscopic examination described the aspect of the vagina, the cervix uteri, leukorrhea and possible inflammatory lesions or ulcerations. a microscopic examination searched for parasites, epithelial cells,  clue cells and leukocytes. the appropriate bacteriological cultures were performed after reading the gram stain and scoring the vaginal flora. the clinical and cytobacteriological aspects were used to identify the bacterial ecology and the pathological genital states. results: genital samples were collected from 306 pregnant women. among them 118 were at 29-32 weeks of gestation, 104 at 33-36 and 84 at 37-40. the most frequent germs were c. albicans (33.3%), enterobacteriaceae (20.3%) including e. coli (10.9%), s. aureus (15.4%), gardnerella (13.6%), and trichomonas (10.6%), in monomicrobian (79.2%) or polymicrobian carriage (20.8%). lower genital tract pathological states such as vaginitis (29.4%), bacterial vaginosis (21.5%) or cervicitis (10.4%) and asymptomatic bacterial carriage (23.5%) and normal genital flora (15%) were identified. conclusion: this is the first report of genital bacterial carriage in african women during the last trimester of pregnancy. larger studies are required to evaluate the risk of maternofetal infections and to improve current prophylaxis measures.

TI  == the potential for probiotics to prevent bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor.
AB  == infections of the urogenital tract in women represent a major burden on the quality of life of women and on the health care system of canada and other countries. complications arising from bacterial vaginosis (bv) include increased  risk of sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus and  elevated risk of preterm birth (ptb). pharmaceutical interventions, such as antibiotics, have been suboptimally effective and have failed to reduce the incidence of ptb. the absence of lactobacilli in the vagina, a specific feature of bv, raises the question as to whether restoration of lactobacilli, by probiotic therapy, can restore the normal flora and improve the chances of having a healthy term pregnancy. the rationale for probiotic use in pregnant women is quite strong. certain lactobacilli strains can safely colonize the vagina after oral and vaginal administration, displace and kill pathogens including gardnerella vaginalis and escherichia coli, and modulate the immune response to interfere with the inflammatory cascade that leads to ptb. additional attributes  of probiotics include their potential to degrade lipids and enhance cytokine levels, which promote embryo development. in a society that focuses on disease rather than health and drug therapy rather than natural preventive measures, it will take some effort to get remedies such as probiotics into mainstream care. perhaps the escalating health care budgets and emergence of "superbugs" will provide the incentives to put in place clinical trials designed to evaluate how best to use the commensal organisms that, after all, make up more of our body than human cells, and without which none of us would survive.

TI  == [role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms  associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and  in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the  need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI  == vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group b streptococci (gbs).
AB  == the microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. as expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). enterobacteriaceae, mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of  vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. candida albicans was present in 10% of  healthy pregnant woman assayed. streptoccocci (streptococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci beta-hemolytic, gbs) was detected in 7% of the samples. gbs infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. furthermore, gbs was often co-isolated with c. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. a complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as gbs, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == clarithromycin-induced alterations in vaginal flora.
AB  == many antibiotics have been shown to alter both the bacterial and the fungal flora of the vagina, in some cases potentially increasing a woman's propensity toward urinary tract infections and vaginal candidiasis. the effects of some of the newer macrolide antibiotics on women's vaginal flora have not been previously studied, and almost none of the previous studies specifically cultured for effects on vaginal lactobacillus. young women (ages 18-45 years) who were about to go onto therapy with clarithromycin, who did not have any conditions known to  affect the vaginal flora (eg, diabetes mellitus, spermicide use, menopausal status without hormone replacement therapy), and who agreed to participate in the study were cultured with aerobic and anaerobic and fungal vaginal cultures before starting the antibiotic. these same women were then retested about 4 to 6 weeks after the start of their antibiotic course, and the results of their preantibiotic and postantibiotic cultures were compared. lactobacillus was present in 33% of patients by vaginal culture before treatment, but this decreased to 0% after treatment. escherichia coli was present in only 8% of patients before treatment, but this increased to 17% of patients after treatment. enterococcus was present in 25% of patients before treatment but in only 8% of patients after treatment. the incidence of gardnerella vaginalis was not affected by the treatment. candida species incidence increased from 17% to 33% with treatment. the overall effects of clarithromycin on the vaginal flora are similar to other older antibiotics that have been tested.

TI  == detection of cervical immunoglobulin a in normal pregnancy.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each  woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55  (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora  showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those  with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI  == pathogenesis of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora.
AB  == objective: this study was undertaken to determine the relationships between microscopy findings on wet mounts, such as lactobacillary grade or vaginal leukocytosis, and results of vaginal culture, lactate and succinate content of the vagina, and levels of selected cytokines. study design: in a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden ayre spatula for wet mounting and ph measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. both univariate analysis (student t test, welch test, chi(2) test, and fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (cox analysis) were used. results: increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades i, iia, iib, and iii) was highly correlated with the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group b streptococci, and escherichia coli. vaginal ph and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence  of epithelial cell lysis decreased. a similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. the concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. in its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. this pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. conclusion: both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, ph, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. there was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis  or lactobacillary grade became more severe. in circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. we speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.

AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

AB  == g. vaginalis is an important pathogen in the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis. therefore, we investigated the influence of transport systems in isolation, a scoring system for gram stains, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. the comparison between a simple (transwab) and a sophisticated (port-a-cul) system showed no differences with regard to for instance enterococcus faecalis or escherichia coli; however, isolation of g. vaginalis, a fastidious microorganism, was significantly higher (alpha < 0.0001) in port-a-cul. there was a strong correlation (97.5%) using the scoring system indicating bacterial vaginosis and isolation of g. vaginalis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of metronidazole for 60 strains of g. vaginalis were higher than 32 mg/l, some strains showing heteroresistance. this phenomenon may be an explanation for treatment failures. clindamycin and erythromycin were much more active, with mic's between 0.016 and 0.19 mg/l, in-vitro development of resistance being slower for clindamycin than for erythromycin. conclusions: (i) for isolation of g. vaginalis, a sophisticated transport system is mandatory; (ii) a scoring system for gram staining is helpful in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis; (iii) in patients with metronidazole treatment failures, clindamycin should be used.

AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

AB  == the pleomorphic bacterium gardnerella vaginalis releases in the culture broth a haemolytic exotoxin (gvh) which is probably a virulence determinant of this unique bacterium, implicated in gynaecological and urological disorders. this 59  kda cytolysin was purified to homogeneity in just one chromatographic step directly from the culture supernatant, a final specific activity up to 1.9 x 10(6) hu mg-1 being obtained. the toxin-induced lesion on human erythrocytes results from the formation of a pore whose radius is approximately 2.4 nm. the damage is inhibited by osmotic protectants and shows a sigmoidal dose-response profile suggesting an aggregation process of haemolysin molecules on the target membrane to create the functional lesion. the extent and the kinetics of haemolysis are strongly dependent on temperature and an activation energy of 64.0 kj mol-1 has been derived. lipid membranes can be very efficient inhibitors of gvh-haemolysis, being able to bind the toxin quite avidly. the inhibitory effect  requires the presence of cholesterol and it is stronger when cholesterol is mixed with negatively charged phospholipids rather than with zwitterionic phospholipids, suggesting that a negative surface potential increases the affinity of the toxin for the lipid bilayer. the functional properties of gvh have been compared with those of clostridium perfringens thetatoxin (pfo) and escherichia coli haemolysin (hlya), which are representative of widespread haemolysins produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the toxin shares several features with the family of the so-called 'sulphydryl-activated' cytolysins produced by gram-positive bacteria, although gvh does not truly belong to this family, being deactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol and being antigenically distinct from them. we report here for the first time the detection in the vaginal fluid of infected women of a specific iga response against the toxin.

TI  == [quantitative study of vaginal flora during the menstrual cycle].
AB  == the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic vaginal flora of 242 healthy women were examined during menstrual cycles. the most frequently isolated microorganisms at  the first premenstrual examination were coagulase-negative staphylococci (61%), followed by enterococci (25%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), diphtheroids (12%), group b streptococci (6.8%), escherichia coli (5.4%) and candida spp. (4%). the isolation rate of all species, except candida and gardnerella vaginalis increased during menstruation. the lowest isolation rate for staphylococcus aureus was 0.9% prior to menstruation and it increased to 7.6% during menstruation. this may be of relevance with regard to the toxic shock syndrome. gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 37% of women at least once during the study, suggesting, that this species belongs to the normal vaginal flora.

TI  == tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 in normal and infected human seminal fluid.
AB  == the presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) and interleukin 2 (il2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. the aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of il2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and tnf alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume  of ejaculate). a significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; p < 0.01) was observed between the tnf alpha and the il2 concentrations. the concentrations of  these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. in contrast, il2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas tnf alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3  fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == emergency cervical cerclage.
AB  == objective: to assess the efficacy of emergency cervical cerclage. design: retrospective review of patients who underwent emergency cervical cerclage between august 1986 and august 1989. setting: university college and the middlesex hospitals obstetric unit, a neonatal referral centre. subjects: 19 women between 16 and 28 weeks gestation with a cervical dilatation between 3 and  10 cm. there were two twin pregnancies. interventions: amniocentesis and bacteriological assessments were performed prior to cerclage and prophylactic antibiotics were given. insertion of sutures was aided by a combination of techniques described previously. main outcome measures: prolongation of gestation and pregnancy outcome. bacteriological findings at delivery and maternal and fetal morbidity were also recorded. results: membranes remained intact in all the women after cerclage. fifteen live babies were born and 13 of them survived (survival rate 63%). gestation was prolonged from between 1 and 19 weeks in these patients and the gestational age at delivery ranged from 25 to 41 weeks. all eight intrauterine or neonatal deaths were associated with infection. infecting organisms included escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis and fusobacterium spp. pregnancy was prolonged for less than or equal to 5 weeks in these infected pregnancies. a cervical laceration occurred in a patient who had the suture inserted at full dilatation and subsequently laboured, but there were no other maternal complications. conclusions: emergency cervical cerclage can prolong pregnancy and influence the  outcome favourably.

TI  == nonoxynol-9: differential antibacterial activity and enhancement of bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the antibacterial activity and adherence-enhancing effects of nonoxynol-9 were evaluated against vaginal and uropathogenic bacteria. nonoxynol-9 was markedly less active against the 43 uropathogenic bacterial and yeast strains tested (mic90, greater than 32%) than against the 26 gardnerella vaginalis strains (mic90, less than or equal to 0.015%) and the 53 lactobacillus strains (mic90, 8%) tested. hydrogen peroxide-producing strains of lactobacillus were more susceptible to nonoxynol-9 (mic90, 4%) than nonproducers (mic90, 16%). two escherichia coli strains that expressed type 1 fimbriae and three vaginal strains of lactobacilli adhered in significantly higher numbers to vaginal epithelial cells preincubated with 5% nonoxynol-9 than to control cells preincubated with pbs. spermicides may provide a selective advantage in colonizing the vagina with  nonoxynol-9-resistant uropathogens such as e. coli, perhaps via a reduction in vaginal lactobacilli (especially hydrogen peroxide-producing strains) and through enhancement of adherence of e. coli to epithelial cells.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == molecular probe for identification of trichomonas vaginalis dna.
AB  == trichomoniasis is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases in the world. diagnosis can be achieved by several methods, such as direct microscopic observation of vaginal discharge, cell culture, and immunological techniques. a 2.3-kb trichomonas vaginalis dna fragment present in strains from diverse geographic areas was cloned and used as a probe to detect t. vaginalis dna in vaginal discharge by a dot blot hybridization technique. this probe was specific  for t. vaginalis dna. it recognized strains from two regions in italy (sardinia,  piemonte) and from mozambique (africa). in addition, our probe did not cross-react with bacterial (escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and lactobacillus spp.), viral (herpes simplex virus type 2), fungal (candida albicans), protozoan (entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, plasmodium falciparum, leishmania major, and leishmania infantum), or human nucleic acids. the probe reacted with pentatrichomonas hominis and trichomonas foetus. the limit signal recognized by our probe corresponded to the dna of 200 t. vaginalis isolates. the 2.3-kb probe was used in a clinical analysis of 98 samples. of these, 20 samples were found to be positive both with the probe and by cell culture, and only 14 of these were positive by a standard wet mount method.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasma hominis. the present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital  mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. at enrollment, g vaginalis was recovered from 99%, bacteroides sp from 94%, peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and m hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. the vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. the mean log concentration was 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/ml for aerobic and 2.6 x 10(8) cfu/ml for anaerobic bacteria. after treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for g vaginalis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and m hominis. the 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted  in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. treatment  with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of lactobacillus,  and a probably transient increase in the frequency of escherichia coli and enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. g vaginalis, mobiluncus species, and three gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the escherichia coli strain used as a control.  inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. the inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (nsv) is postulated, and  b ureolyticus or mobiluncus spp, rather than g vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of nsv.

TI  == controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the  detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. therefore, we studied bactec 6b medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. more aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6b than in the 6b-gelatin medium (p less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (p less than 0.01), escherichia coli (p less than 0.01), other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.05), and acinetobacter spp. (p less than 0.05). when microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6b than in 6b-gelatin (p less than 0.001). we conclude that the 6b medium in its present formulation is superior to 6b medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.

AB  == an enzyme immunoassay (chlamydiazyme) for detecting chlamydia trachomatis was evaluated on genital specimens from 96 men and 272 women attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases (std clinic). compared with a direct immunofluorescence test for chlamydial elementary bodies, the enzyme immunoassay  had a sensitivity of 58% on specimens from men, a specificity of 90%, a positive  predictive value of 93%, and a negative predictive value of 88%; the assay had a  sensitivity of 67% on specimens from women, a specificity of 89%, a positive predictive value of 63% and a negative predictive value of 90%. immunofluorescence provided the most stringent test for the performance of the enzyme immunoassay as values were improved a little when a cell culture procedure was used for comparison. further evidence for the lack of sensitivity was the detection of elementary bodies, sometimes in large numbers, in the enzyme immunoassay buffer of 13 of 19 specimens that had given a negative enzyme immunoassay result and the finding in comparative titrations of four laboratory strains that the enzyme immunoassay was at least 100-fold less able to detect chlamydiae than either immunofluorescence or the cell culture procedure. lack of  specificity may be associated with the finding that the enzyme immunoassay antibody reacted with strains of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and group b streptococci. the enzyme immunoassay was not considered to be sufficiently sensitive, specific, or reproducible for routine use.

TI  == contribution of gardnerella vaginalis to vaginitis in a general practice.
AB  == in a study of 154 adult women who presented to their general practitioner with vaginal symptoms 30 (20%) had gardnerella vaginalis on its own and 51 (33%) had g vaginalis in combination with anaerobes or known pathogens. thirty one (20%) patients were culture negative. those who were culture negative had fewer symptoms and signs of vaginitis than those with g vaginalis alone or g vaginalis  plus anaerobes. those with known pathogens had more symptoms and signs than those with g vaginalis alone or g vaginalis plus anaerobes. those with known pathogens  plus g vaginalis had the most severe signs and symptoms of vaginitis. it is concluded that g vaginalis can cause vaginitis on its own, and it makes vaginitis worse when present with other organisms. g vaginalis was also found in 30 (21%) of the 138 control patients who, although they presented "asymptomatically," had  worse signs than control patients without g vaginalis. it seems that g vaginalis  can occur in a spectrum ranging from the uncomplaining patient to those with severe vaginitis.

TI  == clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  == the roche septi-chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. both systems were inoculated  with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. more clinically important bacteria and fungi, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans and c. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (p less than 0.001). in contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and gardnerella vaginalis (p less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. staphylococci (p less than 0.01), enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli (p less than 0.05), and fungi (p less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (p less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. the overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. for optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.

TI  == bacteriuria due to ureaplasma urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis in women with preeclampsia.
AB  == certain fastidious organisms such as u urealyticum and g vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than  conventional urinary pathogens such as escherichia coli [1]. they can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease,  but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. we investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly u urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. u urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). g vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as u urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). high colony counts of g vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. in  both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases u urealyticum and/or g vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%)  of 34 patients, respectively. this difference was not statistically significant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  == the adherence of four bacterial species and candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci, lactobacillus sp., and c. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of e. coli, adhered well to both cell types. adherence of the piliated e. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with d-mannose. no inhibition of  adherence by d-mannose of g. vaginalis, nonpiliated e. coli, and c. albicans was  demonstrated. scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.

TI  == vaginitis associated with vaginal malodour.
AB  == in two general practices in perth, western australia, the most common microbiological causes of vaginal discomfort in 368 patients were candida albicans. gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis and bacteroides fragilis. amongst patients with abnormal vaginal odour, with or without vaginitis, the most common cause of odour was g. vaginalis. the writers advocate that heavy growths of group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and enterococci should be considered to be the possible cause of vaginal discomfort.  this reinforces the need for care in collection, transportation, and microbiological examination of swabs of the female genital tract. as well as in the clinical interpretation of these reports.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  == adherence of vaginal isolates of escherichia coli, lactobacillus species, group b streptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. the mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for e. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group b streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for g. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for n. gonorrhoeae. adherence of g. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (ph 4 to 8). there were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p  greater than 0.05). the pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. in this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did  not vary with the menstrual cycle.

TI  == the role of fomites in the transmission of vaginitis.
AB  == a role for fomites such as toilet seats in the transmission of vaginitis has never been proved or disproved. a compilation of clinical data from a university  community showed that the organisms found in vaginal cultures of patients with vaginitis were, in order of frequency. candida albicans, escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, hemophilus vaginalis and trichomonas vaginalis. in a concurrent bacteriologic survey of washroom fixtures, staphylococci and other micrococci were isolated most frequently. the overt pathogens associated with vaginitis were never found, and gram-negative organisms appeared to be suppressed by the disinfectant used by the cleaning staff. it is clear that fomites are not  an important mode of transmission in vaginitis, although a search for specific pathogens on toilets is to be continued.
