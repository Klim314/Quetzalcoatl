TI  == complete sequences of a novel blandm-1-harbouring plasmid from providencia rettgeri and an fii-type plasmid from klebsiella pneumoniae identified in canada.
AB  == objectives: emergence of plasmids harbouring bla(ndm-1) is a major public health  concern due to their association with multidrug resistance and their potential mobility. methods: pcr was used to detect bla(ndm-1) from clinical isolates of providencia rettgeri (pr) and klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using vitek 2. the complete dna sequence of two  bla(ndm-1) plasmids (ppry2001 and pkp11-42) was obtained using a 454-genome sequencer flx. contig assembly and gap closures were confirmed by pcr-based sequencing. comparative analysis was done using blastn and blastp algorithms. results: both clinical isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, carbapenems,  aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and susceptible to tigecycline. plasmid ppry2001 (113 295 bp) was isolated from pr. it did not show significant homology to any known plasmid backbone and contained a truncated repa and novel repb. two bla(ndm-1)-harbouring plasmids from acinetobacter lwoffii (jq001791 and jq060896) shared 100% similarity to a 15 kb region that contained bla(ndm-1). ppry2001 also contained a type ii toxin/antitoxin system. pkp11-42 (146 695 bp) was isolated from kp. it contained multiple repa genes. the plasmid backbone had the highest homology to the incfiik plasmid type (51% coverage, 100% nucleotide identity). the bla(ndm-1) region was unique in that it  was flanked upstream by is3000 and downstream by a novel transposon designated tn6229. pkp11-42 also contained a number of mutagenesis and plasmid stability proteins. conclusions: ppry2001 differed from all known plasmids due to its novel backbone and repb. pkp11-42 was similar to incfiik plasmids and contained a number of genes that aid in plasmid persistence.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == novel plasmid and its variant harboring both a bla(ndm-1) gene and type iv secretion system in clinical isolates of acinetobacter lwoffii.
AB  == the spread of the bla(ndm-1) gene is gaining worldwide attentions. this gene is usually carried by large plasmids and has been discovered in diverse bacteria since it was originally found in klebsiella pneumoniae. here we report the complete sequences of a bla(ndm-1)-bearing plasmid, pndm-bj01, and its variant, pndm-bj02, isolated from clinical acinetobacter lwoffii strains. the plasmid pndm-bj01 is 47.3 kb in size and cannot be classified into any known plasmid incompatibility group, thus representing a novel plasmid with an unknown maintenance mechanism. this plasmid contains both a bla(ndm-1) gene and a type iv secretion system (t4ss) gene cluster. the t4ss is assigned to the p-type t4ss group, which usually encode a short, rigid pilus, and the bla(ndm-1) gene is located within a composite transposon flanked by two insertion elements of isaba125. plasmid pndm-bj02 is nearly identical to pndm-bj01 except that one copy of the isaba125 element is missing, and it is therefore regarded as a variant of  pndm-bj01. sequence alignment indicated that this bla(ndm-1)-containing composite transposon, which can also be captured by other mobile elements, was probably a product of multiple recombination events and can move as a whole by transposition.

TI  == [electron microscopic analysis of biofilm on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates and the relationship between bilofilm and lower respiratory infection].
AB  == objective: mechanical ventilation support is a very important method for the salvage of serious patients. however, it can result in the formation of an adherent matrix of bacteria on the surfaces of implanted materials which is termed "biofilm". biofilm is dense bacterial communities attached to a solid surface and surrounded by an exopolysaccharide matrix. one of the most important  features of bacterial biofilm is their resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune system components. as a consequence, diseases involving biofilm are generally chronic and difficult to treat. the present study was conducted to explore the relationship between ett-biofilm and the lower respiratory infection  by observing microbial colonization and associated biofilm accumulation on the surface of endotracheal tubes (etts) removed from neonates treated with intubated mechanical ventilation. methods: twenty neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation (from january to june in 2005) were recruited into this study. clinical data about lower respiratory infection for each case were collected. etts were collected at the first time of extubation. a sterile control tube was also processed. for each ett, a 1-cm-long cross-sectional segment was divided into two portions for both scanning electron microscopy (sem) and aerobic/anaerobic cultures. the presence of biofilm on the surface of etts were examined by sem, meanwhile, bacteria harvested from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract were isolated, identified and assessed on antimicrobial susceptibility, respectively. results: the diagnosis on admission of the twenty cases included: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (10), meconium aspirate syndrome (2), severe asphyxia (2), pneumatothorax (2), severe pneumonia (1), scleredema neonatorum (1), inborn pulmonary hypoplasia (1) and recurrent apnea (1). thirteen cases did not present symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection before mechanical ventilation. however, during the mechanical ventilation process, symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection presented and lasted until extubation. nine of the above mentioned thirteen cases (70%) had the same duration of tube use as mechanical ventilation duration (mean: 3.6 days). observation by sem showed that colonization was time dependent and the incidence of microbial colonization increased when the duration of tube use exceeded one days (12/20). there were no obvious bacterial colonies except that some amorphous material was noted in 5 of 20 etts as early as one day of tube use. up to 2 days of tube use (4/20), attached bacterial colonization was seen embedded in amorphous material (3/4). up to 3 days (7/20), a layer of biofilm formation presented on etts (5/7). furthermore, biofilm architecture became more  mature and complex if the duration exceeded 3 days. neither bacteria nor biofilm  formation was seen on the control ett. the results of aerobic/anaerobic cultures  showed that there were 14 cultures from etts (normal flora grew in 4) and 7 pathogens were isolated; 13 cultures from the secretions of lower respiratory tract (normal flora grew in 1) and 10 pathogens were isolated. seven samples had  the same pathogen both on the surface of etts and in the secretions of lower respiratory tract, which accounted for 50% of the positive cultures from etts, including xanthomonas maltophilia (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), acinetobacter lwoffii (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1) and normal flora (1). the gram-negative  bacteria isolated from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract presented multi-resistance to antibiotics. conclusions: the ett-biofilm develops into mature and complex form with the duration of tube use increase. this study provides evidence that there is correlation between microbial colonization, biofilm formation on the surface of etts and the lower respiratory infection in neonates who were intubated and ventilated for a prolonged period. ett-biofilm could also be a possible source of the recurrent infection. increased attention must be paid to modification of the ett to prevent or substantially reduce biofilm formation.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of 100 serial gram-negative isolates in two intensive care units.
AB  == to determine antimicrobial resistance pattern among gram-negative bacteria isolated from suspected sources of infections in patients hospitalized in two intensive care units (icus) at siriraj hospital from september 1991 to december 1991, minimal inhibitory concentrations of one-hundred consecutive gram-negative  isolates for various antimicrobials were performed using the microbroth dilution  method. of all gram-negative bacterial isolates, 25 per cent were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 22 per cent acinetobacter anitratus, 16 per cent klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 per cent enterobacter, 8 per cent e.coli, 5 per cent non-fermenter, 4 per cent pseudomonas, 3 per cent arizona, 2 per cent a. lwoffii, 1 per cent aeromonas hydrophila, 1 per cent aeromonas hydrophila, 1 per cent proteus rettgeri, and 1 per cent shigella. the in vitro mic study revealed that 50, 48, 43, 61, 59, 34, 47, 52, 31, 15 per cent of gram-negative isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin and imipenem respectively. in addition, 64 and 71 per cent of the isolates were resistant to aminoglycosides and cephalosporins being used in the same patients 48 hours before cultures were  obtained respectively. the possible spread of resistant gram-negative isolates by cross contamination was not evident by looking at mic co-variation in sequential  isolates of p. aeruginosa. it was concluded that antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent among gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients already hospitalized in the icus. potent antimicrobials such as imipenem, newer fluoro-quinolones, ceftazidime and amikacin, are often needed for therapy of serious gram-negative bacterial infections in the icus.
