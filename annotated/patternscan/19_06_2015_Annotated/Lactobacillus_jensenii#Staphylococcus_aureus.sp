TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug  resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml  with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for  a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli  and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == [lactobacillus inhibit adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells].
AB  == to assess the ability of the previously selected human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus) t79-3, t90-1 and lactobacillus jensenii (l. jensenii) t118-3, t231-1 to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus and block their adhesion to hela cells. the inhibitory bioactive substances produced  by these lactobacillus were also identified. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method on agar plates. three types of interaction were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus on adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to hela cells: exclusion group (lactobacillus and hela followed by pathogens), competition group (lactobacillus, hela and pathogens together) and displacement group (pathogens and hela followed  by the addition of lactobacillus). the number of hela cells adhered to staphylococcus aureus was quantified by bacteria colony counts on lb plate. the results showed that lactic acids produced by the lactobacillus are the main substances that can inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and there is variation among the three types of interaction regarding the inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus. the effects of lactobacillus on blocking the adhesion to hela cells were concentration dependent. all four lactobacillus isolates displayed the ability to inhibit staphylococcus aureus growth and block staphylococcus aureus adherence to hela cells. exclusion group was the most effective, and t79-3 showed greater capacity to block staphylococcus aureus adherence compared with the other three isolates. the present study suggests the  potential ability of l. crispatus t79-3 as probiotic for the treatment and prevention of urogenital infections in women.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == managing embolic myocardial infarction in infective endocarditis: current options.
AB  == systemic embolization is common in infective endocarditis and is known to occur in 45-65% of cases. coronary artery embolism has been seen in as many as 60% of cases at necropsy. however, it only rarely has been described as resulting in transmural myocardial infarction. in most cases, coronary embolism is inferred from circumstantial evidence. we present two patients with myocardial infarction  in the setting of acute infective endocarditis. current issues regarding the management of myocardial infarction in infective endocarditis are described in this article. we also describe the first documented case of lactobacillus jensenii endocarditis leading to myocardial infarction. possible factors, which may be instrumental in producing endocarditis with this organism, are also discussed.

TI  == a rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal dna from lactobacillus species and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic dna from various gram-positive bacteria. species tested included lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 4797, lact. acidophilus n2, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, propionibacterium jensenii p126, bacillus pumilus and enterococcus faecalis. our technique for chromosomal dna isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. isolated dna is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning,  polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.
