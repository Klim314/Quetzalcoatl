TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == degradation of arginine and other amino acids by butyrate-producing asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods in periodontal pockets.
AB  == the use of 20 amino acids by butyrate-producing asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) in periodontal pockets, i.e. eubacterium minutum, filifactor alocis, e. infirmum, e. sulci and e. saphenum, was studied. e. minutum used only arginine and lysine, and produced substantial amounts of butyrate and ammonia as the main metabolic products from arginine, and acetate, butyrate and ammonia from lysine. fi. alocis used arginine alone and produced butyrate and ammonia. e. infirmum, e. sulci and e. saphenum used lysine alone and produced acetate, butyrate and ammonia. the growth of these bacterial species was supported and enhanced by arginine and/or lysine enriched to culture media, but not by the other amino acids. arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase  and carbamate kinase activity were detected in the cell-free extract of e. minutum, suggesting that arginine was metabolised to citrulline initially, and subsequently to ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate. ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate were further converted to butyrate, and carbon dioxide and ammonia, respectively. enzymatic activity of arginine deiminase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase was not detected in fi. alocis, indicating that fi. alocis converted arginine to ornithine directly, not via citrulline, and further to butyrate.
