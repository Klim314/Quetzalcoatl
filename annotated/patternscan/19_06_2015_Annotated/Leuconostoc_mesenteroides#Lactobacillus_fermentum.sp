TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == hydroxycinnamic acids used as external acceptors of electrons: an energetic advantage for strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acids by strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (19 strains) was investigated as a potential alternative energy route. lactobacillus curvatus pe5 was the most tolerant to hydroxycinnamic acids, followed by strains of weissella spp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, for which the mic values were the same. the highest sensitivity was found for lactobacillus rossiae strains. during growth in mrs broth, lactic acid bacteria reduced caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids into dihydrocaffeic, phloretic, and dihydroferulic acids, respectively, or decarboxylated hydroxycinnamic acids into the corresponding vinyl derivatives and then reduced the latter compounds to ethyl compounds. reductase activities mainly emerged, and the activities of selected strains were  further investigated in chemically defined basal medium (cdm) under anaerobic conditions. the end products of carbon metabolism were quantified, as were the levels of intracellular atp and the nad(+)/nadh ratio. electron and carbon balances and theoretical atp/glucose yields were also estimated. when cdm was supplemented with hydroxycinnamic acids, the synthesis of ethanol decreased and the concentration of acetic acid increased. the levels of these metabolites reflected on the alcohol dehydrogenase and acetate kinase activities. overall, some biochemical traits distinguished the common metabolism of strictly heterofermentative strains: main reductase activity toward hydroxycinnamic acids, a shift from alcohol dehydrogenase to acetate kinase activities, an increase in the nad(+)/nadh ratio, and the accumulation of supplementary intracellular atp. taken together, the above-described metabolic responses suggest that strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria mainly use hydroxycinnamic acids as external acceptors of electrons.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == effects of initial air removal methods on microorganisms and characteristics of fermented plant beverages.
AB  == the effects of 3 different methods for removing the initial air on the properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham.) were investigated. only method m which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water filled plastic bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. however, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. the fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4  pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its  higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1-5 using the method m from both fermented plant beverages were leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4-5 in the wild forest noni beverage. from days 6-14 the isolates were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only l. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. during days 21-45 both beverages had a similar lab population of l. plantarum and l. brevis while l. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage. between days 60-90 in both plant beverages only l. plantarum and lactobacillius sp. were detected.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous mixed starter for lactic acid fermentation of  carrots, french beans or marrows.
AB  == strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, weissella soli/weissella koreensis, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus fermentum were identified from raw carrots, french beans and marrows by partial 16s rrna gene sequence. l. plantarum m1, leuc. mesenteroides c1 and p. pentosaceus f4 were selected based on the rates of growth and acidification in vegetable juice media, and used as the autochthonous mixed starter for the fermentation of carrots, french beans or marrows. an allochthonous starter, consisting of the same species, was also used for fermentation. a two-step fermentation process (1 day at 25 degrees c and 7 days at 15 degrees c) in brine (1% w/v) followed by storage at room temperature in olive oil until 40 days was set up. unstarted vegetables subjected to the same treatments were used as the controls. cell numbers of lactic acid bacteria in the started vegetables were ca. 10,000 (autochthonous starter) and 1000 (allochthonous starter) times higher than unstarted samples throughout the process. when fermented with the autochthonous starter, carrots, french beans or  marrows were characterized by the rapid decrease of ph (<4.5), marked consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, and inhibition of enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. fermentation with the allochthonous starter did not acidify and inhibit bacteria  and yeasts so rapidly. after 40 days, carrots, french beans and marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter had significantly (p<0.05) higher total concentration of vitamin c (ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) with respect to those fermented with the allochthonous starter and, especially unstarted vegetables. the same was found for the indexes of color. firmness of both started vegetables  was higher than unstarted vegetables. sensory analysis differentiated started vegetables. carrots and french beans fermented with the autochthonous starter were, especially, appreciated for fragrance. appearance was the sensory attribute that mainly distinguished marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  == the ethanol production in brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. this work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic  fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. lower mic was found for b. subtilis (10 ppm) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of kamoran(r) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for b. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this kamoran(r) dosage. the growth of  industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than  wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. the main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.

TI  == survival rate analysis of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria using the arrhenius and z-value models.
AB  == the survival rate of five freeze-dried bacteria species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, weisella paramesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus fermentum, was described in terms of reaction rate constants (d or k) and temperature sensitivity of rate constants (z or ea). the freeze-dried strains were stored under vacuum at 55, 37, and 4 degrees c for 168 h, 17 days, and 2 months, respectively. d-values decreased and k increased with an increase of the storage temperature. neither the z-value nor the inactivation energy (ea)  of the reaction was significantly different (p > 0.05) for all the strains, suggesting that thermal inactivation of the freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria may occur by the same mechanism. therefore, it was possible to compare rate constants of survival for the freeze-dried strains studied.

TI  == characterisation and biochemical properties of predominant lactic acid bacteria from fermenting cassava for selection as starter cultures.
AB  == a total of 375 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermenting cassava in south africa, benin, kenya and germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and  genotypic tests. these could be divided into five main groups comprising strains  of facultatively heterofermentative rods, obligately heterofermentative rods, heterofermentative cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative  rods, in decreasing order of predominance. most of the facultatively heterofermentative rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant  bacteria (54.4% of strains) isolated in the study. the next predominant group of  lactic acid bacteria (14.1% of total isolates) consisted of obligately heterofermentative rods belonging either to the genus lactobacillus or weissella, followed by the heterofermentative cocci (13.9% of isolates) belonging to the genera weissella or leuconostoc. homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13.3% of isolates). biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and h(2)o(2)-production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. a total of 32 strains with one or more desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-pcr fingerprinting in combination with 16s rrna sequencing of representative rep-pcr cluster isolates.  of these strains, 18 were identified as l. plantarum, four as lactobacillus pentosus, two each as leuconostoc fallax, weissella paramesenteroides and lactobacillus fermentum, one each as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the l. plantarum-group. these strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using rapd-pcr with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for gari production.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == detection of leuconostoc strains at a meat processing plant using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == to simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers specific for leuconostoc from 16s rrna gene sequences. these primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, lact. sake, lact. fermentum, lact. acidophilus and weissella viridescens. pcr with this primer detected all leuconostoc species tested (leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, leu. pseudomesenteroides, leu. carnosum, leu. lactic, leu. citreum, leu. amelibiosum, leu. gelidum), except for leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. the method could identify areas contaminated with leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of lab producing dextran) and pcr, whereas 29 were negative according to both. six samples were culture-negative but positive by pcr. no false negative results were generated by pcr. the method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, leuconostoc mesenteroides inoculants, or a chemical additive on the fermentation, aerobic stability, and nutritive value of crimped wheat grains.
AB  == the preservation of crimped wheat grains by three bacterial inoculants or a chemical additive was compared. crimped wheat grain [56.8 g dry matter (dm)/kg] was conserved in 1.75-kg plastic bag, mini-silos without treatment, with 4l/tonne of crimpstore (cs; an additive containing a mixture of ammonium formate, propionate, ethyl benzoate, and benzoate, sas kelvin cave, ltd., uk) or 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of each of three inoculant additives containing lactobacillus fermentum (a), leuconostoc mesenteroides (b), and lactobacillus buchneri (c). six replicates were conserved per treatment. ensiling dm losses, chemical composition, fermentation characteristics, and aerobic stability were measured in the silages after 68 d of ensiling. all the silages were well fermented and remained stable for 84 h after aeration. subsequently, the rate of deterioration  was slowest in crimped grains treated with cs treatment, followed by those treated with inoculant c, while those treated with inoculant a deteriorated most  rapidly. residual water-soluble carbohydrate concentration was higher in crimped  grains treated with cs than those treated with the inoculants. ammonia nitrogen concentrations were lowest in cs-treated crimped grains, followed by inoculants c and a. dm losses were greater in cs-treated crimped grains than in crimped grains treated with inoculants a and c. in vivo digestibility was also measured in texel-cross lambs fed a grass silage basal diet supplemented with the additive-treated crimped grains or a conventional, lamb finisher concentrate. dry matter intake and digestibility were unaffected by treatment. in conclusion, bacterial inoculants containing l. buchneri are promising preservatives for crimped wheat grains.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria constituting the predominating microflora  in an acid-fermented condiment (tempoyak) popular in malaysia.
AB  == tempoyak is a traditional malaysian fermented condiment made from the pulp of the durian fruit (durio zibethinus). salt is sometime added to proceed fermentation at ambient temperature. in various samples obtained from night markets, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were the predominant microorganisms, ranging from log 8.4 to  log 9.2 cfu g(-1). no other microorganisms were present to such a level. these samples contained reduced amount of saccharose, glucose and fructose but increased amount of d- and l-lactic acid and acetic acid compared with samples of non-fermented durian fruit. sixty-four isolates of lab were divided into five groups by use of a few phenotypic tests. a total of 38 strains of lab were selected for comparison by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of their whole cell protein patterns with a sds-page database of lab. these strains were also examined for their carbohydrate fermentation patterns by use of api 50 ch. isolates belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum group were shown to be the predominant members of the lab flora. in addition, isolates belonging to the lactobacillus brevis group, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus mali, lactobacilus fermentum and an unidentified lactobacillus sp. were also observed. a high degree of diversity among isolates belonging to the lb. plantarum group was demonstrated by analysis  of their plasmid profiles.

TI  == molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (colombia).
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. these products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical  phenotypic and biochemical tests. in the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rrna phylogenetic probes and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (lb. manihotivorans, lb. plantarum, lb. casei, lb. hilgardii, lb. buchneri, lb. fermentum, ln. mesenteroides and pediococcus sp.). however, the most frequently isolated species were lb. plantarum and lb. manihotivorans. the rapd analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between lb. manihotivorans or lb. plantarum  strains. these results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. we propose that the presence of the amylolytic lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == culture of five commonly used acid-producing bacteria on banana pulp.
AB  == a significant fraction of the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. the use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. the abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing ripe or green bananas were examined. three homofermentative bacteria, lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the ph  of a puree of ripe bananas from 4.8 to about 3.5 to 3.6 in 7 days at 37 degrees c. action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in ph was less pronounced. very little gas evolved. lactobacillus fermentum (formerly lactobacillus fermenti) and leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in ph. about twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. the fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in  a clear liquor. the color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance  and aroma throughout a 1-month storage test.
