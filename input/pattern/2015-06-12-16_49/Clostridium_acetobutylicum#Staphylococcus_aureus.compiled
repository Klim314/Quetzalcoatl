TI  - The putative influence of the agr operon upon survival mechanisms used by Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum produces acids as an energy-yielding process during exponential growth. An acidic environment, however, is toxic to the cells and two survival mechanisms are in place to prevent them from dying. Firstly, during a solventogenesis phase, the cells take up these acids and convert them to solvents, thus raising the environmental pH. Secondly, the cells undergo sporulation to form highly resistant spores capable of surviving extreme conditions. One possible regulatory mechanism for these processes is the accessory gene regulatory (agr) quorum-sensing system, which is thought to coordinate cell population density with cell phenotype. We model this system to monitor its putative effect upon solventogenesis and the sporulation-initiation network responsible for triggering spore formation. We demonstrate that a high population density should be able to induce both solventogenesis and sporulation, with variations to the parameter set allowing sporulation alone to be triggered; additional distinct signals are capable of restoring the solventogenic response. We compare the agr system of C. acetobutylicum with that of Staphylococcus aureus in order to investigate why the differences in feedback between the two systems may have evolved. Our findings indicate that, depending upon the mechanism of interaction between the agr system and the sporulation-initiation network, the clostridial agr circuitry may be in place either to moderate the number of spores that are formed (in order for this number to reflect the urgency of the situation), or simply as an energy-saving strategy.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  - beta-Glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from Ruminococcus gnavus E1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-Glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp DNA fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from R. gnavus E1 was determined. Five ORFs were detected on this fragment: three complete ORFs (ORF2, gus and ORF3) and two partial ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5). The products of ORF2 and ORF3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), such as Escherichia coli BglC, Bacillus subtilis BglP and Bacillus halodurans PTS Enzyme II. The product of ORF5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bglA). The gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of Lactobacillus gasseri (69%), E. coli (61%), Clostridium perfringens (59%) and Staphylococcus aureus (58%). By complementing an E. coli strain in which the uidA gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the R. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes ORF2, ORF3 and ORF5.
TI  - Analysis of orthologous hrcA genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The hrcA gene codes for a transcriptional repressor protein interacting with the  CIRCE operator thereby reducing expression of the groE operon of more than 120 bacterial species. At least in Bacillus subtilis, the activity of the HrcA protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system. We amplified the hrcA gene from five different bacterial species and analyzed its activity in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. While those from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus turned out to be active, those of Helicobacter pylori, Lactococcus lactis and Thermotoga maritima were inactive in E. coli, but that of T. maritima turned out to repress expression of the reporter gene in B. subtilis. All these results strongly suggest to us a specific recognition of HrcA by the GroE chaperonin system.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - The ESAT-6/WXG100 superfamily -- and a new Gram-positive secretion system?
AB  - ESAT-6 is a small secreted protein of unknown function from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is of fundamental importance in virulence and protective immunity. A PSI-BLAST search has identified distant homologues of ESAT-6 in more tractable bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The genes for ESAT-6-like proteins often cluster with genes encoding homologues of B. subtilis YukA. I speculate that the ESAT-6-like and YukA-like proteins form a novel Gram-positive secretion system potentially driven by the FtsK/SpoIIIE ATPase domains in the YukA-like proteins. The way is now open to investigate this hypothesis in organisms that are easier to manipulate than pathogenic mycobacteria.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the DNA gyrase (gyrA) gene from Mycoplasma hominis and characterization of quinolone-resistant mutants selected in vitro with trovafloxacin.
AB  - We report the cloning and characterization of the gyrA gene of the Mycoplasma hominis DNA gyrase, which was previously shown to be associated with quinolone resistance in this organism. The 2,733-bp gyrA gene encodes a protein of 911 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 102.5 kDa. As expected, M. hominis GyrA exhibits higher homology with the GyrA subunits of the gram-positive bacteria Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus than with its Escherichia coli counterpart. Knowing the entire sequence of the gyrA gene of M. hominis could be very useful for confirming the role of the GyrA subunit in fluoroquinolone resistance. Twenty-nine mutants of M. hominis were selected stepwise for resistance to trovafloxacin, a new potent fluoroquinolone, and their gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE quinolone resistance-determining regions were characterized. Three rounds of selection yielded 3 first-step, 12 second-step, and 14 third-step mutants. The first-step mutants harbored a single substitution, Glu460-->Lys (E. coli coordinates), in ParE. GyrA changes, Ser83-->Leu, Glu87-->Lys, and Ala119-->Glu or Val, were found only in the second round of selection. At the third step, additional substitutions, at ParC Ser80, Ser81, and Glu84 and ParE Leu440, associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, appeared. Thus, high-level resistance to trovafloxacin required three steps and was associated with alterations in both fluoroquinolone targets. According to these genetic data, in M. hominis, as in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, topoisomerase IV seems to be the primary target of trovafloxacin.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the dnaK gene region from Bacillus sphaericus in the context of genomic comparisons.
AB  - The dnaK gene region of Bacillus sphaericus was cloned as a 3.8 kb HindIII fragment and an overlapping 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment by using an internal B. sphaericus specific dnaK gene probe generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Complete DNA sequencing of the two fragments revealed three complete open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs exhibited a high degree of identity to the grpE dnaK, and dnaJ heat shock genes from other gram-positive bacteria. The order of the genes was found to be grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Additionally, the 5'-end and 3'-end contained amino acid sequences that were homologous to the C-terminal sequence of the hrcA gene and the N-terminal sequence of ORF35 (yqeT), respectively, from Bacillus subtilis. The entire hrcA gene from B. sphaericus was then isolated by high-fidelity PCR and completely sequenced. A transcription stop site is located between the dnaK and dnaJ genes but not after the dnaJ gene. Consistent with this observation, the dnaJ gene is immediately followed by an ORF that shows a high degree of identity to ORF35 from B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The presence of ORF35 is not indicated in other genera representing the gram-positive bacteria. The amino acid sequence of ORF35 exhibited nearly 30% identity with the methyltransferase for large subunit ribosomal protein L11 from gram-negative Proteobacteria and the related protein from cyanobacteria, other gram-negative bacteria, and Archaea, suggesting the presence of the gene for this protein in the common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea. The absence of the ORF35 gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other gram-positive bacteria indicates that the loss of this gene must have occurred in an ancestor of other gram-positive bacteria following their divergence from the ancestor of Bacillus/Clostridium/staphylococcus lineage.
TI  - The S box regulon: a new global transcription termination control system for methionine and cysteine biosynthesis genes in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The molecular mechanisms for regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine are poorly characterized in Bacillus subtilis. Analyses of the recently completed B. subtilis genome revealed 11 copies of a highly conserved motif. In all cases, this motif was located in the leader region of putative transcriptional units, upstream of coding sequences that included genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. Additional copies were identified in Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus, indicating conservation in other Gram-positive genera. The motif includes an element resembling an intrinsic transcriptional terminator, suggesting that regulation might be controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. The 5' portion of all of the leaders could fold into a conserved complex structure. Analysis of the yitJ gene, which is homologous to Escherichia coli metH and metF, revealed that expression was induced by starvation for methionine and that induction was independent of the promoter and dependent on the leader region terminator. Mutation of conserved primary sequence and structural elements supported a model in which the 5' portion of the leader forms an anti-antiterminator structure, which sequesters sequences required for the formation of an antiterminator, which, in turn, sequesters sequences required for the formation of the terminator; the anti-antiterminator is postulated to be stabilized by the binding of some unknown factor when methionine is available. This set of genes is proposed to form a new regulon controlled by a global termination control system, which we designate the S box system, as most of the genes are involved in sulphur metabolism and biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Sporulation and primary sigma factor homologous genes in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Using a PCR-based approach, we have cloned various sigma factor homologous genes  from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792. The nucleotide sequence of the dnaE-sigA operon has been determined and predicts two genes encoding 69- and 43-kDa proteins. The deduced DnaE amino acid sequence has approximately 30% amino acid identity with protein sequences of other primases. The putative sigA gene product shows high homology to primary sigma factors of various bacteria, most significantly to Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that both genes from an operon, which is clearly expressed under conditions that allow for cell division. A promoter sequence with significant homology to the sigma H-dependent Bacillus promoters preceded the determined transcriptional start point, 182 bp upstream of the GUG start codon of dnaE. The homologous genes to Bacillus spp. sporulation sigma factors G, E, and K have been cloned and sequenced. Indirect evidence for the existence of sigma F was obtained by identification of a DNA sequence homologous to the respective Bacillus consensus promoter. Southern hybridization analysis indicated the presence of sigma D and sigma H homologous genes in C. acetobutylicum. A new gene group conserved within the eubacteria, but with yet unspecified functions, is described. The data presented here provide strong evidence that at least some of the complex regulation features of sporulation in B. subtilis are conserved in C. acetobutylicum and possibly Clostridium spp.
TI  - Molecular cloning of two new heat shock genes related to the hsp70 genes in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified two new heat shock protein genes, orf37 and orf35, in Staphylococcus aureus, located upstream and downstream of grpE(hsp20), dnaK(hsp70), and dnaJ(hsp40) homologous genes in the order orf37-hsp20-hsp70-hsp40-orf35. The transcripts of both orf37 and orf35 were increased by thermal upshift of the culture from 37 to 46 degrees C. The heat shock promoters were located upstream of orf37 and upstream of hsp40. The deduced peptide of orf37 showed similarity with those of orfA in Clostridium acetobutylicum and orf39 in Bacillus subtilis. orf35 was unique in S. aureus and has not yet been described in other bacteria.
TI  - A general method for cloning recA genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - An internal fragment of the recA gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. The internal 348- or 360-bp recA DNA segments from Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Leuconostoc mesanteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The G + C contents of the DNA from these species range from 28 to 52%. The sequences of the bacterial recA genes show strong relatedness. This method is particularly useful for the recovery of the recA genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.
TI  - Study of antibacterial activity and bacteriology of latex from Asclepias syriaca  L.
AB  - Whole and fractionated latex of Asclepias syriaca was tested for antimicrobial or growth-promoting activity with 16 genera and species of bacteria. Latex and extracted fractions (distilled water, acetic acid, sodium bicarbonate, sulfuric acid, and ethyl ether) possessed no detectable antimicrobial activity. Comparison of growth curves of selected bacteria incubated with serum and rubber fractions, as well as controls, revealed no detectable inhibition of growth, except for a slight inhibitory response to autoclaved serum. Most bacteria were capable of utilizing latex for a substrate as indicated by the increased growth rate in the exponential phase. The stationary phase was entered simultaneously by both the treated cultures and the controls. Various bacteria cultured in a litmus latex mixture yielded populations which ranged from <10(4) organisms/ml for Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus to 1.1 x 10(10) organisms/ml for Clostridium acetobutylicum. Whole latex, as well as the serum and rubber fractions, support the growth of various bacteria, but under field conditions there is no evidence for systemic infection of this type of cell by bacteria.
