TI  == actinomyces coleocanis sp. nov., from the vagina of a dog.
AB  == a hitherto undescribed actinomyces-like bacterium was isolated from the vagina of a dog. biochemical testing and page analysis of whole-cell proteins indicated that the isolate was phenotypically different from previously described actinomyces species and related taxa. sequencing of 165 rrna showed that the unknown bacterium was distinct from all currently known actinomyces species. phylogenetically, the unidentified organism displayed a specific association with actinomyces europaeus, but a sequence divergence of > 5% demonstrated that it represents a distinct species. based on both phenotypic and 165 rrna sequence considerations, it is proposed that the unknown strain from a dog be classified as a novel species, actinomyces coleocanis sp. nov. the type strain is ccug 41708t (= cip 106873t).
