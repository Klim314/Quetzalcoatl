TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == investigation of the influences of puberty, genetics, and environment on the composition of subgingival periodontal floras.
AB  == the classical twin model was utilized in this study in an attempt to determine the importance of host genetics to the composition of the subgingival flora. simultaneously, the effect of puberty on the flora composition was assessed. the  compositions of the floras were significantly different at ages 11 and 14 in the  same people, indicating that transition to an adult flora composition may be initiated during puberty. however, the numbers of subjects who had prepubertal and postpubertal testosterone levels in this study were too small to demonstrate  significant differences based solely on testosterone level (p = 0.053 and 0.11 for tests of unrelated members, i.e., all twins "a," the first twin of each pair, and all twins "b," the second twin of each pair). sixteen unrelated 11-year-old subjects had prepubertal levels of less than 30 ng of testosterone per dl of serum, and only six of these unrelated subjects had levels above 300 ng/dl by age 14. of their twin siblings, who formed the second group of unrelated individuals, 15 had prepubertal levels and only 5 reached postpubertal levels. unpaired t tests indicated that veillonella atypica, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica were among the species that contributed most to changes in flora composition during puberty. the compositions of subgingival floras of 11-year-old monozygous and dizygous male twins were significantly more similar than those of  unrelated subjects in the study (p = 0.004 and 0.009, respectively). at 12.5 years of age, the floras of monozygous twins remained more similar than those of  unrelated subjects (p = 0.001), but the dizygous-twin floras were not significantly more similar than those of unrelated people. this difference corresponded with moderate and varied testosterone levels within dizygous-twin pairs at age 12.5. by age 14 both monozygous and dizygous twins again had floras  with compositions more similar than those of unrelated people (p = 0.008 and 0.002, respectively). estimates of the genetic contributions to the increased similarity of the floras of twins as compared with floras of unrelated people indicated that the concentrations of several species in the flora may be influenced by host genetic factors. the prevalence of certain other species appeared to be controlled primarily by environment.
