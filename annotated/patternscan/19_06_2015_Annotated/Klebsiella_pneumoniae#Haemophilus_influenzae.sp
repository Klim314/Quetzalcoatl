TI  == association of targeted multiplex pcr with resequencing microarray for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens.
AB  == a large number of viral and bacterial organisms are responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) which contributes to substantial burden on health management. a new resequencing microarray (rpm-ivdc1) associated with targeted multiplex pcr was recently developed and validated for multiple respiratory viruses detection and discrimination. in this study, we evaluated the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for simultaneous identification of multiple viral and bacterial organisms. the nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas) of 110 consecutive cap patients, aged from 1 month to 96 years old, were collected from five distinct general hospitals in beijing during 1-year period. the samples were subjected to  the rpm-ivdc1 established protocol as compared to a real-time pcr (qrt-pcr), which was used as standard. the results of virus detection were consistent with those previously described. a total of 37 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 of haemophilus influenzae, 10 of mycoplasma pneumoniae, two of klebsiella pneumoniae and one of moraxella catarrhalis were detected by rpm-ivdc1. the sensitivities and specificities were compared with those of qrt-pcr for s. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), h. influenzae (92.3, 97.9%, respectively), m. pneumoniae (69.2, 99.0%, respectively), k. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), and m. catarrhalis (100, 100%, respectively). additional 22 of streptococcus spp., 24 of haemophilus spp. and 16 of neisseria spp. were identified. in addition, methicillin-resistant and carbapenemases allele were also found in nine of staphylococcus spp. and one of k. pneumoniae, respectively. these results demonstrated the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for simultaneous detection of broad-spectrum respiratory pathogens in complex backgrounds and the advantage of  accessing to the actual sequences, showing great potential use of epidemic outbreak investigation. the detection results should be carefully interpreted when introducing this technique in the clinical diagnostics.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate ceftaroline fosamil dosing regimens for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections in patients with normal and impaired renal function.
AB  == in this study, the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment (pta) of ceftaroline against clinical isolates causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) and complicated skin and skin-structure infection (csssi) in europe was evaluated. three dosing regimens were assessed: 600 mg every 12 h (q12 h) as a 1-h infusion (standard dose) or 600 mg every 8 h (q8 h) as a 2-h infusion in virtual patients with normal renal function; and 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal impairment. pharmacokinetic and microbiological data were obtained from the literature. the pta and the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) were calculated by monte carlo simulation. in patients with normal renal function, the ceftaroline standard dose (600 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion) can be sufficient to treat cabp due to ceftazidime-susceptible (caz-s) escherichia coli, caz-s klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (cfr>90%). however, against meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), the cfr was 72%. in csssi, the cfr was also <80% for mrsa. administration of ceftaroline 600  mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion or 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal insufficiency provided a high probability of treatment success (cfr ca. 100%) for most micro-organisms causing cabp and csssi, including mrsa and penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae. these results suggest that in patients with normal renal function, ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion may be a better option than the standard dose, especially if the mrsa rate is high.

TI  == global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. we report here on susceptibility among gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). most enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in north america, europe, and asia/pacific rim. amikacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in north america. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported for 11.0% of escherichia  coli isolates and 24.2% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the middle east and >43% in africa and latin america, respectively. statistically significant (p<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to  12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except haemophilus influenzae. significant (p<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.

TI  == aspiration in head and neck cancer patients: a single centre experience of clinical profile, bacterial isolates and antibiotic sensitivity pattern.
AB  == most patients with head and neck cancer have dysphagia and are at increased risk  of having aspiration and subsequent pneumonia. it can cause prolonged hospitalization, treatment delay and/or interruption and mortality in cancer patients. the treatment of these infections often relies on empirical antibiotics based on local microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. the aim of present study is to analyse respiratory tract pathogens isolated by sputum culture in head and neck cancer patients undergoing treatment at a tertiary cancer centre in south india who presented with features of aspiration. the study is carried out to establish empirical antibiotic policy for head and neck cancer  patients who present with features of aspiration. this was a retrospective study. the study included sputum samples sent for culture and sensitivity from january 2011 to december 2012. analysis of microbiologic species isolated in sputum specimen and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the bacterial isolates was performed. a detailed study of case files of all patients was done to find out which is the most common site prone for producing aspiration. there were 47 (31.54 %) gram positive isolates and 102 (68.45 %) gram negative isolates. the most common bacterial isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae (25.50 %), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (16.77 %) and haemophilus influenzae (15.43 %). levofloxacin was the most effective antibiotic with excellent activity against both gram positive and  gram negative isolates. most patients with aspiration had laryngeal cancer (34.89 %). aspiration pneumonia was present in 14 (9.39 %) patients. gram negative bacteria are common etiologic agents in head and neck cancer patients presenting  with features of aspiration. levofloxacin should be started as empirical antibiotic in these patients while awaiting sputum culture sensitivity report. as aspiration in head and neck cancer is an underreported event such institutional antibiotic sensitivity studies should be encouraged for prompt initiation of antibiotic that is most likely to be effective against etiologic pathogens.

TI  == hira-tan: a real-time pcr-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  == identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. to identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. here, we devised a pcr-based test, named hira-tan, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g.  streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. mycoplasma pneumoniae or legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. the utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the hira-tan assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for h. influenzae; 93.2% for pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for escherichia coli; 78.1% for mrsa and 91.6% for s. pneumoniae. overall the hira-tan procedure was able to identify the  causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. the hira-tan approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the hira-tan will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. clinical trials registration: umin000001694.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in latin america, 2010.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. in this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five latin  american countries from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against s. pneumoniae with a mic90 value (0.12mug/ml) that was eight-fold  lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus (including mrsa) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (mic90, 1mug/ml) and linezolid (mic90, 2mug/ml). the beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. these parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are  not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. these results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in  community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in latin  america, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) breathprinting of multiple bacterial lung pathogens, a mouse model study.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. to improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that sesi-ms breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella  catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. after applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via sesi-ms breathprinting (p < 0.0001). therefore, we  have shown the potential of this sesi-ms approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.

TI  == predictors of viral pneumonia: the need for viral testing in all patients hospitalized for nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == aim: community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. however, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. the present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors  of viral pneumonia. methods: a prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for cap confirmed by chest radiographs. results: a cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) viral culture. the commonest bacterial isolates were haemophilus influenzae (31), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), klebsiella spp. (9) and streptococcus pneumoniae (6). influenza a virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 a/h1n1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent  viral causes. independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (rr 3.056, p = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (rr 0.425, p = 0.026). conclusions: all nursing home residents hospitalized for cap should undergo npa viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. we suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for cap if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.

AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the viridans  streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (rti). very scanty information is available on the isolation of s. pseudopneumoniae from india. hence, the present  study was an attempt to isolate s. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to  study their drug resistance pattern. methods: sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as s. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin  susceptibility in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air. disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. results: among the samples screened,  4 per cent showed the growth of only s. pseudopneumoniae. other pathogens isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans. all the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to  erythromycin. interpretation & conclusions: our preliminary results showed presence of s. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with rti. currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent co(2) as s. pneumoniae and the resistant ones  are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. as a result, s. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air  along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) isolates in namibia: implications for empirical antibiotic treatment of meningitis.
AB  == objective: bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency associated with high mortality rates. cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture is the "gold standard" for diagnosis of meningitis and it is important to establish the susceptibility of the causative microorganism to rationalize treatment. the namibia standard treatment guidelines (stgs) recommends initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with signs and symptoms of meningitis after taking a csf sample for culture and sensitivity. the objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of microorganisms isolated from csf to antibiotics commonly used in the empirical treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis in namibia. methods: this was a cross-sectional descriptive study of routinely collected antibiotic susceptibility data from the namibia institute of  pathology (nip) database. results of csf culture and sensitivity from january 1,  2009 to may 31, 2012, from 33 state hospitals throughout namibia were analysed. results: the most common pathogens isolated were streptococcus species, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, and escherichia coli. the common isolates from csf showed high resistance (34.3% -73.5%) to penicillin. over one third (34.3%) of streptococcus were resistance to penicillin which was higher than 24.8% resistance in the united states. meningococci were susceptible  to several antimicrobial agents including penicillin. the sensitivity to cephalosporins remained high for streptococcus, neisseria, e. coli and haemophilus. the highest percentage of resistance to cephalosporins was seen among esbl k. pneumoniae (n = 7, 71%-100%), other klebsiella species (n = 7, 28%-80%), and staphylococcus (n = 36, 25%-40%). conclusions: the common organisms isolated from csf were streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus, and e. coli. all common organisms isolated from csf showed high sensitivity to cephalosporins used in the empirical treatment of meningitis. the resistance of the common isolates to penicillin is high. most esbl k. pneumoniae were isolated from csf samples drawn from neonates  and were found to be resistant to the antibiotics recommended in the namibia stgs. based on the above findings, it is recommended to use a combination of aminoglycoside and third-generation cephalosporin to treat non-esbl klebsiella isolates. carbapenems (e.g., meropenem) and piperacillin/tazobactam should be considered for treating severely ill patients with suspected esbl klebsiella infection. namibia should have a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system for early detection of antibiotics that may no longer be effective in treating meningitis and other life-threatening infections due to resistance.

TI  == a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major  tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from  january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance  to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial resistance of community-acquired pneumonia in adult patients in china.
AB  == background: appropriate antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is mainly based on the distribution of etiology and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens. we performed a prospective observational study of  adult with cap in 36 hospitals in china. methods: etiological pathogens were isolated in each of the centers, and all of the isolated pathogens were sent to zhongshan hospital for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using agar dilution. results: a total of 593 patients were enrolled in this study, and 242 strains of  bacteria were isolated from 225 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae (79/242, 32.6%) was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by haemophilus influenzae (55/242, 22.7%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (25/242, 10.3%). totally 527 patients underwent serological tests for atypical pathogens; mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae infections were identified in 205 (38.9%) and 60 (11.4%) patients respectively. legionella pneumophila infections were identified in 4.0% (13/324) of patients. the non-susceptibility rate of isolated  streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin and penicillin was 63.2% and 19.1% respectively. six patients died from the disease, the 30-day mortality rate was 1.1% (6/533). conclusions: the top three bacteria responsible for cap in chinese  adults were streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenza and klebsiella pneumonia. there was also a high prevalence of atypical pathogens and mixed pathogens. the resistance rates of the major isolated pathogens were relatively low except for the high prevalence of macrolide resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == epidemiology, aetiology and management of childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia in developing countries--a review.
AB  == childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. in children who have not received prior antibiotic therapy, the main bacterial causes of clinical pneumonia in developing countries are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), and the main viral cause is respiratory syncytial virus  (rsv), but estimates of their relative importance vary in different settings. the only vaccines for the prevention of bacterial pneumonia (excluding vaccines for pertussis and measles) are hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (pcv). in children with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, bacterial infection remains a major cause of pneumonia mortality; however, pneumocystis jirovecii and mycobacterium tuberculosis are important causes of pneumonia in them. studies of  bacterial aetiology of acute pneumonia in severely malnourished children have implicated klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae, with very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. studies of neonatal sepsis suggest that gram-negative enteric organisms, particularly klebsiella spp., and gram-positive  organisms, mainly pneumococcus, group b streptococcus and s. aureus are causes of neonatal pneumonia. many of the developing countries that ranked high in pneumonia mortality are preparing to introduce new pneumonia vaccines with support from global alliance for vaccine and immunization (gavi alliance), plan for the expansion of community-based case management and have ambitious plans for strengthening health systems. assurance that these plans are implemented will require funding and continued public attention to pneumonia, which will help contribute to a substantial decline in childhood pneumonia deaths.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of japanese society of chemotherapy, japanese association  for infectious diseases, and japanese society for clinical microbiology in 2009:  general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == for the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in japan, the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) started a survey in 2006. from 2009, jsc continued the survey  in collaboration with the japanese association for infectious diseases and the japanese society for clinical microbiology. the fourth-year survey was conducted  during the period from january and april 2009 by the three societies. a total of  684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 staphylococcus aureus, 127 streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 123 haemophilus influenzae, 70 moraxella catarrhalis, 78 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 pseudomonas aeruginosa). a maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four  aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp and prsp) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. a high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in moraxella catarrhalis isolates. four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k.  pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. four isolates (2.5 %) of p. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.

AB  == peptide deformylase (pdf) catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the n-terminal methionine residue in newly synthesized polypeptides, which is an essential process in bacteria. four new inhibitors of pdf that belong to two different classes, hydroxamate/pseudopeptide compounds [pmt387 (7a) and pmt497] and reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds [pmt1039 (15e) and pmt1067], have been developed. these compounds inhibited the growth of several pathogens involved in respiratory-tract infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and leading nosocomial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae with a minimum  inhibitory concentration (mic) in the range 0.1-0.8 mg ml(-1). interestingly, the reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds showed a 250-fold higher antimicrobial activity towards s. aureus, although the four compounds showed similar k(i) values against s. aureus pdf enzymes, with k(i) values in the 11-85 nm range. to  provide a structural basis for the discovery of additional pdf inhibitors, the crystal structures of s. aureus pdf in complex with the four inhibitors were determined at resolutions of 1.90-2.30 a. the inhibitor-bound structures displayed distinct deviations depending on the inhibitor class. the distance between the zn(2+) ion and the carbonyl o atom of the hydroxamate inhibitors (or  the hydroxyl o atom of the reverse-hydroxamate inhibitors) appears to be correlated to s. aureus inhibition activity. the structural information reported  in this study should aid in the discovery of new pdf inhibitors that can be used  as novel antibacterial drugs.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == comparison of the wst-8 colorimetric method and the clsi broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (wst-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the clsi method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower mics. the extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (vre) and multi-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) in the broth microdilution method. there was excellent agreement between the mics determined after 24h using the wst-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. the results suggest that the wst-8 colorimetric assay is a  useful method for rapid determination of consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == bronchoscopic findings in children with chronic wet cough.
AB  == objectives: protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as the presence of more than 4 weeks of chronic wet cough that resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy, in the absence of alternative diagnoses. the diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis is not readily accepted within the pediatric community, however, and data on the incidence of bacterial bronchitis in children are deficient. the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial bronchitis in children with chronic wet cough and to analyze their bronchoscopic findings. methods: we performed a retrospective review of charts of children who presented with chronic wet cough, unresponsive to therapy, before referral to the pediatric pulmonary clinic. results: a total of 197 charts and bronchoscopy reports were analyzed. of 109 children who were 0 to 3 years of age, 33 (30.3%) had laryngomalacia and/or tracheomalacia. the bronchoscopy showed purulent bronchitis in 56% (110) cases and nonpurulent bronchitis in 44% (87). the bronchoalveolar lavage bacterial cultures were positive in 46% (91) of the children and showed nontypable haemophilus influenzae (49%), streptococcus pneumoniae (20%), moraxella catarrhalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (12%), and klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 patient. the chi(2) analysis demonstrated that positive bacterial cultures occurred more frequently in children with purulent bronchitis (74, 69.8%) than in children with nonpurulent bronchitis (19, 19.8%) (p < .001). conclusions: children who present with chronic wet cough are often found to have evidence of purulent bronchitis on bronchoscopy. this finding is often indicative of a bacterial lower airway infection in these children.

TI  == a randomised, double-blind trial comparing ceftobiprole medocaril with ceftriaxone with or without linezolid for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is a serious infection requiring hospitalisation in 20% of cases. the novel cephalosporin ceftobiprole has microbiological activity against the major bacterial pathogens causing cap, including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as against staphylococcus aureus, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). this was a multicentre, double-blind study in which 706 patients with cap severe enough to require hospitalisation were randomised to ceftobiprole or to an expert-recommended course of ceftriaxone +/-  linezolid (comparator group). clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined 7-14 days after completion of therapy (test-of-cure visit). for the 469 clinically evaluable patients, cure rates were 86.6% vs. 87.4% for ceftobiprole and comparator, respectively [95% confidence interval (ci) of the difference, -6.9% to 5.3%]; in the intention-to-treat (itt) analysis of 638 cap patients, these cure rates were 76.4% vs. 79.3%, respectively (95% ci of the difference, -9.3% to 3.6%). a typical bacterial pathogen was identified in 29% of the itt population. microbiological eradication rates in the 144 microbiologically evaluable patients were 88.2% and 90.8% for the respective treatment groups (95% ci of the difference, -12.6% to 7.5%). both study drugs were well tolerated, with but a minority of patients requiring premature discontinuation due to an adverse event (6% in the ceftobiprole group and 4% in the comparator group). the overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events  was higher in the ceftobiprole group, primarily owing to differences in rates of  self-limited nausea (7% vs. 2%) and vomiting (5% vs. 2%). in summary, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to the comparator (ceftriaxone +/- linezolid) in all clinical and microbiological analyses conducted, suggesting that ceftobiprole has a potential role in treating hospitalised patients with cap.

TI  == clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  == aim: to investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) hyperintensity. materials and methods: the clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid dwi hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. results: the patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes. the remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by cryptococcus neoformans. subarachnoid dwi hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly  distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). in addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). conclusion: both bacterial and fungal  meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on dwi, predominantly around the frontal lobe. this finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.

TI  == evaluation of ceftobiprole activity against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, including escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and beta-lactamase negative), and klebsiella pneumoniae, in a rabbit meningitis model.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril, a new cephalosporin, is highly active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. in this study, we tested ceftobiprole against various gram-negative  pathogens in a rabbit meningitis model and determined its penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf). in this animal model, ceftobiprole produced an antibacterial activity similar to that of cefepime against an escherichia coli strain, a klebsiella pneumoniae strain, and a beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae strain. against a beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae strain, ceftobiprole was significantly superior. the penetration of ceftobiprole through  inflamed meninges reached about 16% of serum levels compared to about 2% of serum levels through uninflamed meninges.

TI  == differential effect of prior influenza infection on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli: involvement of interferon-gamma production.
AB  == the influenza a virus is one of the main causes of respiratory infection. although influenza virus infection alone can result in pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection combined with the virus is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. interestingly, while influenza infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and haemophilus influenzae, other bacteria such as escherichia coli (e.  coli) and klebsiella pneumoniae are not associated with influenza infection. the  reason for this discrepancy is not known. in this study, it was found that prior  influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of s.  aureus but not of e. coli. here, the mechanism for this inhibition is elucidated: prior influenza virus infection strongly increases interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) production. furthermore, it was shown that ifn-gamma differentially affects alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of s. aureus and e. coli. the findings of the present study explain how influenza virus infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, such as s. aureus, but not others, and provides evidence that ifn-gamma might be a promising target for protecting the human population from secondary bacterial infection by influenza.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in asia: report from the community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips) study, 2009-2010.
AB  == a multicentre resistance surveillance study [community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips)] investigating the susceptibilities of  2963 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus spp. from asia against 12 antimicrobial agents was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. based on the breakpoints for oral penicillin v recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pnssp) ranged from 46% to 100%. azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited variable resistance rates of 0-88% against s. pneumoniae, 0-57% against mssa and 0-76.5% against streptococcus spp. isolates. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae varied from 5.1% to 58.5%. beta-lactamase  production rates amongst h. influenzae isolates ranged from 15% to 46.6% and amongst m. catarrhalis isolates from 90% to 100%. amongst m. catarrhalis isolates, macrolide resistance and cefaclor resistance rates of 5.8% and 1.2%, respectively, were found, mainly in mainland china. levofloxacin resistance rates of 0-3.9% with a mic(90) (minimum inhibitory concentration causing inhibition of  90% of isolates) of 1-2mg/l and moxifloxacin resistance rates of 0-1.7% with a mic(90) of 0.125-0.5mg/l were found amongst pnssp isolates. moxifloxacin was very active against streptococcus spp., h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis isolates, with mic(90) values of 0.125-0.25, 0.032-0.5 and 0.064-0.125mg/l, respectively. these results from the cartips study have confirmed some significant regional differences in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of s. pneumoniae, mssa, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and streptococcus spp. and emphasise the importance of  antimicrobial surveillance programmes for guiding empirical therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in distinct geographic areas.

AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == potential role of tigecycline in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == tigecycline is a member of the glycylcycline class of antimicrobials, which is structurally similar to the tetracycline class. it demonstrates potent in vitro activity against causative pathogens that are most frequently isolated in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp), including (but not limited to) streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, and 'atypical organisms' (namely chlamydophila pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila). comparative randomized clinical trials to date performed in hospitalized patients receiving tigecycline 100 mg intravenous (iv) x 1 and then 50 mg iv twice daily thereafter have demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to the comparator agent. major adverse effects were primarily gastrointestinal in nature. tigecycline represents a parenteral monotherapy option in hospitalized patients with cabp (especially in patients unable to receive respiratory fluoroquinolones). however, alternate and/or additional therapies should be considered in patients with more severe forms of cabp in light of recent data of increased mortality in patients receiving tigecycline for other types of severe infection.

TI  == comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four north european countries.
AB  == background: this study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus) in denmark (n = 9), finland (n = 10), norway (n = 7) and sweden (n = 19). methods: the hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive gram-positive  and 30 gram-negative clinical isolates. supportive information accompanying each  isolate included the study centre, ward level (pcc, ghw, or icu), patient identification and source of the isolate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the etest. results:  the isolates collected comprised 1610 gram-negative and 1767 gram-positive clinical isolates. the study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (i) and resistant (r)) to tigecycline: <1% in escherichia coli, though other enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and serratia spp. (23%)). the overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding serratia spp.). the activity of tigecycline against haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. was high with a mic(50) of  0.25 mg/l and mic(90) of 1 mg/l. the prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among gram-positive bacteria was <1%. the corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. the activity of tigecycline against streptococcus pneumoniae was high with mic(50) and mic(90) of 0.125 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli was i (6%), rather than r (<1%). this indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

TI  == clinical features of healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap) in a japanese community hospital: comparisons among nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap), hcap other than nhap, and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == background and objective: more than 100000 japanese die of pneumonia every year.  the number of people residing in nursing homes is increasing with the ageing of the population. in 2005, the american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america (ats/idsa) published important guidelines for the management of healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap). in japan, however, the optimum strategy for management of hcap is still unclear. the purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical features of patients with hcap. methods: patients (n = 202) who were consecutively admitted with a diagnosis of acute pneumonia between  october 2007 and september 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. using the ats/idsa guidelines, patients were divided into three groups: a community-acquired pneumonia (cap) group (n = 123), a nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap) group (n = 46) and a hcap other than nhap (o-hcap) group (n = 33). these groups were then compared with respect to laboratory data, microbiological findings and mortality. results: thirty-day mortality in the nhap group (10.9%) tended to be higher than that in the cap group (3.3%) or the o-hcap group (0%). the pathogens most frequently identified were streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in the cap group, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae in the nhap group, and s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae in the o-hcap group. conclusions: the nhap group was clinically different from the o-hcap group, based on bacteriological examination  and mortality rates. in order to accurately diagnose, and formulate optimum treatment strategies for japanese patients, the categories of hcap, as specified  in the ats/idsa guidelines, should not be applied directly either to patients with nhap or those with o-hcap.

TI  == clinical study concerning the relationship between community-acquired pneumonia and viral infection in northern thailand.
AB  == objective: the etiological agents associated with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in thailand have been studied extensively in bacterial pathogens, but not in viral pathogens. to clarify the association of viral pathogens with cap, we conducted a comprehensive study of viral and bacterial pathogens in patients with cap. methods: we enrolled 119 hospitalized patients with cap in nakornping hospital, chiang mai, thailand between 2006 and 2008. the severity of pneumonia was classified and the risk factors for death were estimated. bacterial and fungal pathogens were determined from specimens taken from blood and sputum, and  viral pathogens were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by rt-pcr using primers specific for 7 respiratory viruses. results: overall, 29 patients were hiv-infected and 90 patients were non-hiv-infected. the microbial pathogens most  commonly isolated among hiv-infected patients were: 4 klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 mycobacterium tuberculosis and 3 haemophilus influenzae. among non-hiv infected patients, predominant microbial pathogens were: 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 haemophilus influenzae and 4 klebsiella pneumoniae. as for viral pathogens for cap, influenza virus was identified from 2 hiv-infected patients and 5 non-hiv infected patients. in addition, human rhinovirus (hrv) and respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv) were identified from 2 patients each among non-hiv-infected patients. conclusion: our study demonstrates that the most common viral agent was influenza virus (5%), followed by hrv (2%) and rsv (2%) among cap patients in northern thailand. the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) seems to be correlated with the severity of illness.

TI  == comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  == objectives: to document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the usa and europe during 2008-09.  methods: a selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (cap; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using clsi broth microdilution methods. organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the usa and 28 (12 countries) in europe. ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of mic endpoints made by applying current clsi (2010) and eucast (2010) breakpoint criteria. results: against 1340 streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/l (mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/l) and was 8-fold more  active than ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 mg/l; only 79.2% coverage at eucast breakpoint). haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; mic(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; mic(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/l) were very susceptible to  ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (mdr) patterns. the potency of ceftaroline against three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/l) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative enterobacteriaceae strains between the usa and europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for e. coli). ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant e. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/l) or k. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). conclusions: the ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (usa and europe) documented low mic(50/90) values for s. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/l, respectively. more importantly, ceftaroline mic(90) results for  s. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/l), h. influenzae (0.015 mg/l) and m. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/l) were very low, all mics being </=0.5 mg/l. ceftaroline exhibited promising  high potency and wide coverage against gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cap, especially isolates of mdr pneumococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("mamef").
AB  == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is  needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can  detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant  body fluids).

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in asian countries. in asia, one of  the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15), new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae, mdr salmonella enterica serotypes choleraesuis and typhi, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii (oxa-58 and oxa-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant candida glabrata. a few clones of mdr a. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in asia, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed  in china. in addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium  tuberculosis (xdr-tb) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (hdap): should hdap be included in healthcare-associated pneumonia?
AB  == although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (hdap) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (hcap) in the 2005 american thoracic society (ats)/infectious diseases society of america (idsa) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. this study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of hdap and to assess whether hdap should be included in the hcap category. we retrospectively analyzed 69 hdap patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on a-drop (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. the most common pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (10.1%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). this distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of hcap reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (mdr) gram negatives such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of mrsa was higher. there were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of mdr pathogens, between the two severity groups. despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past hcap reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of mdr pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in mdr positive vs. 8.5% in mdr negative; p = 0.242). assessment for  not only mdr pathogens, but also severity of illness by the a-drop system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. our results suggest that hdap should be included in the hcap category, while understanding that there are  some differences.

TI  == incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: there is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. objective: this study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. methods: a microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between march 2004 and may 2005 was performed. relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. definitions of infections were based on the centers for disease control (cdc) criteria. in the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. results: there were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), and enterobacter spp were cultured from  the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with cns (32), s. aureus (28), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), e. coli (5), corynebacterium species (3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) proteus mirabilis (4), enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with cns on 2 occasions. seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured staphylococcus species in their nares. four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. most items were heat sterilized. cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. the choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. the ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. staffs were not protected when handling  linen. infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. they were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. the only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. all waste types were stored together prior to final  disposal away from the public. conclusion: the incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.

TI  == [acquired bacterial meningitis in monastir region, tunisia (1999-2006): bacteriological aspects and susceptibility patterns].
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of bacteria responsible for purulent meningitis and the pattern of resistance of common species in the university hospital of monastir (tunisia). all bacteriologically confirmed cases  of bacterial meningitis were recorded between 1999 and 2006, and have been analyzed by classic bacterial methods advocate for meningitis. two hundred fifty  three strains have been isolated. the most frequent species were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by escherichia coli and neisseria meningitides with 19.4, 13.8, 13.8, 7.1, and 6.3%  of cases, respectively. their distribution with regard to age was in accordance with literature data. the yearly distribution of these bacteria did not show any  epidemic peak. enterobacteriaceae and group b streptococcus were the most frequently identified pathogens in neonatal meningitis. h. influenzae was the predominant microorganism in children between three month and five years of age (36.3%), followed by s. pneumoniae (28.8%). s. pneumoniae was the predominant bacteria responsible for 47% of the cases over five years of age. 38.8% of s. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible to penicillin. resistance rates for amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 4.1%, respectively. only one strain of n. meningitidis (6.2%) presented a decreased susceptibility to penicillin. 22.9% of  h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae to third generation cephalosporins were 25%. in our study, nosocomial meningitis have shown a rate of 24.4%. the most affected service was neurosurgery, pediatrics, and intensive care units. the increasing prevalence of  pneumococci meningitis with reduced sensitivity to penicillin g strains isolated  from meningitis makes adequate therapeutic management difficult.

TI  == neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  == aim: to analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. methods: seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. results: of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). the most common gram-negative organisms were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. to the gram-negative organisms, the  most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. conclusions: the most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium  identified.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between january and september 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti). ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest mic(90 )against  965 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp)). against 470 haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in  vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. higher mic(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). as was foreseeable, streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains)  was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated mic(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. beta-lactamase-negative moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. levofloxacin showed the lowest mic(50)/mic(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. as regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest mic(90)s against klebsiella pneumoniae. cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest mic(90)s against escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).in conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for carti, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of carti.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in india: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (icu)-acquired infection. the aetiology of vap varies with different patient populations and types of icus. methodology: a prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing vap and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (mdr) pathogens. combination disk method, modified hodge test, edta disk synergy (eds) test and ampc disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (mbl) and ampc beta-lactamases respectively. results: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, candida  spp. were more common in early-onset vap, while non-fermenters (pseudomonas spp.  and acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset vap (p value 0.0267, chi-square value 4.91). thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 vap pathogens were multidrug resistant. esbl was produced by 50% and 67% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. mbl was produced by 20%  of p. aeruginosa. ampc beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. of the s. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for vap by mdr pathogens. conclusions: vap is increasingly associated with mdr pathogens. production of esbl, ampc beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. increasing prevalence of mdr pathogens  in patients with late-onset vap indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of h1n1 pandemic influenza.
AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  == the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions.  examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the  proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis,  beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.

AB  == sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "guideline for treatment for  adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (a) and moderate (b) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (ctrx), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), meropenem (mepm), doripenem (drpm), biapenem (bipm) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. the covering rate was analyzed  using the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae revealed  the mic90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of pk/pd break points except bipm and sbt/abpc to  h. influenzae, and sbt/abpc to k. pneumoniae. however, the analysis of p. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that  these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. the analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to taz/pipc in mic90 while covering rates of isolates at pk/pd break points showed inferiority to taz/pipc. this tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. this is because the maximum dose approved in japan is as low as half that in ipm/cs and 1/3 that in mepm in western countries.

AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), gatifloxacin (gflx), garenoxacin (grnx), levofloxacin (lvfx), moxifloxacin (mflx), norfloxacin (nflx), prulifloxacin (pufx), and tosufloxacin (tflx) using streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(esbl) producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) isolated from clinical materials. based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area  under the curve (auc)/mic of 120 or more for gram-negative and 30 or more for gram-positive bacteria was calculated using monte carlo simulation (mcs), and was assessed as the efficacy. grnx showed the lowest mic50 and mic90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against s. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. grnx also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, mssa) other  than s. pneumoniae. the antimicrobial activity of cpfx against h. influenzae was  most potent. the mic50 and mic90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. however, the mic50 and mic90 values of the other agents were also favorable. pufx showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae. both of  mic50 and mic90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. on efficacy assessment using mcs, grnx, gflx, and mflx showed a probability of 90% or more against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. against s. agalactiae, grnx, mflx, and gflx showed a probability of approximately 60%. all agents showed a low probability against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae; pufx showed a maximum (43.63%). grnx, mflx, gflx, and lvfx showed a probability of 90% or more against mssa. furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance  inhibition, an auc/mic of more than 200 against s. pneumoniae, is achieved. grnx  showed the highest probability (95.05%). it also exhibited a similar probability  even when the target value was established as 250. recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. in the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.

TI  == rapid detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood: a reasonable and reliable tool for middle and low resource countries.
AB  == introduction: delay in appropriate treatment in patients with bacteraemia can increase morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures. we compared the rapid direct test (rdt) designed to detect esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria (gnb)  directly from positive blood cultures bottles, with two conventional esbl detection tests: screening and confirmatory disk diffusion assay (sc-dda) and an  mic screening and esbl e-test (mic/et). material and methods: we screened all blood cultures in a tertiary care facility from august to december 2005. we only  included one positive bottle per patient in which gnb were observed. rdt: blood from each bottle was inoculated on mueller-hinton agar. ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks with and without clavulanic acid were added and incubated at 35  degrees c +/- 2 degrees c for 24 h. results were interpreted according to clsi recommendations for the sc-dda and mic/et. all methods were performed simultaneously. time for reporting as an esbl-producer and cost of the tests were recorded. results: we isolated 124 gnb in 114 episodes of bacteraemia, 10 of them (8.8%) polymicrobial; 79 (63.7%) of the gnb were enteric bacteria, 44 (35.5%) glucose non-fermenter gnb and one haemophilus influenzae. the most common microorganism was escherichia coli in 56 episodes (45.2%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa in 24 (19.3%), and klebsiella pneumoniae in 13 (10.5%). of the 114 episodes, 41 (36%) had at least one gnb resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, and 25 (21.9%) were caused by an esbl-producing gnb. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv)  for the rdt were 96%, 98.9%, 96% and 98.9%, respectively. agreement by kappa index between rdt and sc-dda was 0.95 and between the rdt and mic/et was 0.92. the rdt detected 24/25 esbl-producing bacteria. the mean time to detect an isolate as an esbl producer after a positive blood culture bottle signal was 1.02 +/- 0.19 days when using the rdt, and 3.40 +/- 0.59 days when using any other method. the difference in reporting time was 2.38 +/- 0.63 days (p < 0.0001). our estimated cost per test was $1.54 for rdt, $2.32 for screening/ confirmatory sc-dda, and $49.65 for mic screening and mic/et. conclusions. the rdt is a rapid, reliable and easy analysis to perform, as well as cost-effective.

TI  == pneumonia in severely malnourished children in developing countries - mortality risk, aetiology and validity of who clinical signs: a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: to quantify the degree by which moderate and severe degrees of malnutrition increase the mortality risk in pneumonia, to identify potential differences in the aetiology of pneumonia between children with and without severe malnutrition, and to evaluate the validity of who-recommended clinical signs (age-specific fast breathing and chest wall indrawing) for the diagnosis of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. methods: systematic search of the existing literature using a variety of databases (medline, embase, the web of science, scopus and cinahl). results: mortality risk: sixteen relevant studies were identified, which universally showed that children with pneumonia and moderate or severe malnutrition are at higher risk of death. for severe malnutrition, reported relative risks ranged from 2.9 to 121.2; odds ratios ranged from 2.5 to 15.1. for moderate malnutrition, relative risks ranged from 1.2 to 36.5. aetiology: eleven studies evaluated the aetiology of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. commonly isolated bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and haemophilus influenzae. the spectrum and frequency of organisms differed from those reported in children without severe malnutrition. there are very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. clinical signs: four studies investigating the validity of clinical signs showed  that who-recommended clinical signs were less sensitive as predictors of radiographic pneumonia in severely malnourished children. conclusions: pneumonia  and malnutrition are two of the biggest killers in childhood. guidelines for the  care of children with pneumonia and malnutrition need to take into account this strong and often lethal association if they are to contribute to the un millennium development goal 4, aiming for substantial reductions in childhood mortality. additional data regarding the optimal diagnostic approach to and management of pneumonia and malnutrition are required from regions where death from these two diseases is common.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == for the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in japan, the japanese society of  chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from january to august, 2007. a total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 staphylococcus aureus, 257 streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 streptococcus pyogenes, 206 haemophilus influenzae, 120 moraxella catarrhalis, 122 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 pseudomonas aeruginosa). a total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the incidence of methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp and prsp) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. among haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately-resistant (blnai),  29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. two isolates (1.2%) of pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.

TI  == early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  == the choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (icu) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. data from  308 icus from the german national nosocomial infection surveillance system, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the icu. the frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. a total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the cdc criteria had been modified. from 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus (2,718  cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant s. aureus), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), escherichia coli (1,137 cases), enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671  cases), haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). the order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: s. aureus was first, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli. thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. this classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract of school children in buea, cameroon.
AB  == the study was aimed at determining bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract and the susceptibility patterns of isolates to antibiotics. in total, 200 throat swabs were obtained from students attending different boarding schools within the buea municipality and screened to obtain the prevalence of respiratory pathogens and to understand the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates using standard microbiological procedure and the disc-diffusion test. of the 200  samples screened, 112 (56%) had positive cultures with the dominant bacterial pathogens being haemophilus influenzae (20%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (15%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and staphylococcus aureus (10%). although 56% of the isolates were recovered from females compared to 44% from males, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). sixty-seven percent of the pathogens were isolated from the age-group of 10-13 years, 19.6% from the age-group of 14-17 years, and 12.5% from the age-group of 18-21 years. antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that gentamicin (92%) and cefuroxime (88.4%) were the most effective antibiotics against the isolates. generally, susceptibility ranged from 0% to 92% depending on the antibiotic and the species  of microorganism. penicillin had the highest (100%) resistance to all the isolates. the findings revealed that students living in boarding schools in the buea municipality were at risk of acquiring upper respiratory tract infections from their peers since the upper respiratory tract of more than 50% of the students was colonized with respiratory pathogens. although multidrug-resistant strains of organisms were identified, gentamicin and cefuroxime are recommended as the first-line antibiotics of choice against the pathogens. there is, therefore, a need for surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage of resistant strains of these organisms, especially h. influenzae in unhealthy school children since the vaccine is yet to be introduced in cameroon. the findings have clinical and epidemiological significance.

TI  == bacterial aetiology and outcome in children with severe pneumonia in uganda.
AB  == background: pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the 'under-5s' and in uganda accounts for 10-30% of childhood deaths. antibiotic resistance is increasing. objective: to describe the bacterial aetiology, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcome of severe pneumonia among children aged 2-59 months admitted to the acute care unit, mulago hospital, uganda. methods: a  total of 157 children aged 2-59 months with symptoms of severe pneumonia according to who guidelines were recruited over a 4-month period in 2005/2006. blood and induced sputum were obtained for culture, and chest radiographs were undertaken. children were clinically classified as having severe or very severe pneumonia and were followed up for a maximum of 7 days. results: bacteraemia was  detected in 15.9% of patients with staphylococcus aureus (36%) and streptococcus  pneumoniae (28%) were the organisms most commonly isolated. bacteria were isolated from sputum in half of the children, the commonest organisms being streptococcus pneumoniae (45.9%), haemophilus influenzae (23.5%) and klebsiella species (22.4%). staphylococcus aureus had only 33.3% sensitivity to chloramphenicol and h. influenzae isolates were completely resistant. s. pneumoniae was sensitive to chloramphenicol in 87.4% of cases. the case fatality  rate was 15.5%. independent predictors of death were very severe pneumonia (or 12.9, ci 2.5-65.8), hypoxaemia (sao(2) <92%, or 4.9, ci 1.2-19.5) and severe malnutrition (or 16.5, ci 4.2-65.5). conclusion: s. aureus, s. pneumoniae and h.  influenzae are common bacterial causes of severe pneumonia. chloramphenicol, the  current first-line antibiotic for treating severe pneumonia in ugandan children,  is useful in pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae but other common bacteria show resistance. the presence of severe malnutrition, hypoxaemia and very severe pneumonia increase the risk of death and should be considered in case management  protocols.

TI  == pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in japanese adult patients.
AB  == this study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in japanese adult  patients. a total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and monte carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the pk-pd target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). the final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (cl(cr)) and body weight (bw) were the most significant covariates: cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x cl(cr) + 1.49, v (c)(l) = 0.185 x bw(0.931), q(l/h) = 4.55, v  (p)(l) = 5.86, where cl is the clearance, v (c) is the volume of distribution of  the central compartment, q is the intercompartmental clearance, and v (p) is the  volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. the monte carlo simulation  demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a pk-pd target attainment probability of >  or =85% against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. however, against haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the cl(cr) and bw of the patient. these results provide a pk-pd-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in japanese adult patients.

TI  == the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  == trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to  have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  == the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of  the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first  of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further  characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli,  murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  == objectives: although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. the purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. methods: a retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.  we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic  sensitivity. results: among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. in recurrent tonsillitis, staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). in patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, klebsiella pneumoniae was  isolated at a significantly higher percentage. in tonsillar hypertrophy, h. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by s. pyogenes (24.2%), s. aureus (22.9%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. in both groups, s. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas k. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. we found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, h. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. we also found  no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. conclusions: we observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent  tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. our study indicates that essential  bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.

TI  == crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2x: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. to envision the binding of cefditoren to pbps, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of pbp 2x from s. pneumoniae strain r6 complexed with cefditoren. there are two pbp 2x molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. the structure reveals that the orientation of trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. the methylthiazole group of the c-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues his394, trp374, and thr526 in molecule 1 and residues his394, asp375, and thr526 in molecule 2. the formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the  pocket to which the c-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. these features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against s. pneumoniae.

AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == we compared bact/alert 3d with conventional culture for the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed with the disk diffusion method, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was calculated. automation was superior in terms of recovery  and time to detect pathogens. the bacterial spectrum in cap was streptococcus pneumoniae (35.3%) staphylococcus aureus (23.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (20.5%) and haemophilus influenzae (8.8%). three of the 12 s. pneumoniae isolates showed  penicillin resistance on mic and two showed erythromycin resistance. there were two h. influenzae strains resistant to penicillin; these were beta lactamase producers. one-fourth of the s. aureus were oxacillin resistant. all isolates were sensitive to cefepime by disc diffusion and mic methods. in the treatment of cap, cefotaxime and cefepime are useful drugs when given as empirical therapy against multidrug resistant strains. the use of automation is vital in cap, as rapid diagnosis and effective therapy can reduce mortality.

TI  == sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in taiwan with an emphasis on klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of copd (aecopd). this study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of aecopd. methods: medical records from 494 episodes of aecopd in patients admitted to the national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 to june 2004 were reviewed. severity of copd was classified according to the 2003 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guideline. results: potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of aecopd. the predominant bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%),  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), enterobacter species (6.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). the incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. k. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage i copd (39.1%) than stage ii  (16.6%), iii (13.8%) and iv (9.4%). no glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage i patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p. aeruginosa (odds ratio (or) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.21-8.38), intubation (or 14.81; 95% ci: 5.08-43.12) and age (or  1.1; 95% ci: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with aecopd in taiwan, with the former being more commonly  isolated from mild copd and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. these results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with aecopd.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
AB  == from october 2004 to september 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 87, streptococcus pneumoniae 80, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, klebsiella pneumoniae 15, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. of 87 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. against mrsa, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: 128 microg/ml or more) for abk  (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the  strains at 0.125 microg/ml. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p.  aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (amk) had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 4 microg/ml. the activity of czop against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, czop, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the  growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with  bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (21.6%), s. pneumoniae (24.7%) and h. influenzae (20.1%). s. aureus (20.9%), s. pneumoniae (16.1%), and h. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.3%) and h. influenzae (25.1%). the bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were p.  aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria of childhood lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  == objective: to study the pathogenic bacteria of lower respiratory tract infection  (lrti), and age and gender distribution and drug resistance of the pathogenic bacteria in children. methods: sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected in sterile tubes from all of the children with lrti who had been admitted to the children's hospital of zhejiang university between august 2001 and july 2002. antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using the vitek system, the kirby-bauer diffuse method and the etest method after bacteria were identified. results: among the 4,238 patients with lrti during the study period,  1,181 patients were bacteria-positive, with a positive rate of 27.9%. streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae) was the most common (222 strains), followed by haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) (216 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (216 strains), escherichia coil (e. coli) (169 strains) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (89 strains). the isolation rate of s. pneumoniae in females was significantly higher than in males (6.2% vs 4.7%; p < 0.05). however, the isolation rates of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus in males were higher than in females (5.1% vs 4.1% and 2.5% vs 1.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). a higher incidence of lrti due to s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was found in the 1-3 years group, while the incidence of lrti due to k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. aureus and e. cloacae was higher in patients under 1 year of age. antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that rates of penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, ampicillin resistant h. influenzae, oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  and esbl-positive k. pneumoniae and e. coli were 55.0%, 16.5%, 41.2%, 42.6% and 4.5%, respectively. conclusions: s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, k. pneumoniae, e.  coli and s. aureus were common pathogens of lrti in children. the infection rate  varied with age and gender. antibiotics for treating lrti should be selected based on the drug susceptibility test.

AB  == in vitro activities of ertapenem and 11 other comparator agents were tested against 1025 isolates of respiratory pathogens collected from 12 asian countries. resistance rate to ertapenem was 1.2% in 602 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(50), 0.06/mic(90), 1 microg/ml). ertapenem was also very active against penicillin-, ciprofloxacin-, erythromycin-, and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal  isolates (resistance rate: 3.5%, 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.7%, respectively). ertapenem-resistant pneumococcal isolates were found only in vietnam and korea. ertapenem resistance was not found in methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. in vitro data suggest that  ertapenem could be a useful treatment option for community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
AB  == a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of  the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus  aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.

TI  == [use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == quinolones sensitize gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to the vast majority of  antibiotics is a challenge worldwide. antimicrobial peptides (aps) make up the front line of defense in those areas exposed to microorganisms, and there is intensive research to explore their use as new antibacterial agents. on the other hand, it is known that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics affect the expression of numerous bacterial traits. in this work we evaluated whether treatment of bacteria with subinhibitory concentrations of quinolones may alter the sensitivity to aps. a 1-h treatment of klebsiella pneumoniae with 0.25 x the  mic of ciprofloxacin rendered bacteria more sensitive to polymyxins b and e, human neutrophil defensin 1, and beta-defensin 1. levofloxacin and nalidixic acid at 0.25 x the mics also increased the sensitivity of k. pneumoniae to polymyxin b, whereas gentamicin and ceftazidime at 0.25 x the mics did not have such an effect. ciprofloxacin also increased the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin-resistant strains to polymyxin b. two other pathogens, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae, also became more sensitive to polymyxins b and e after treatment with 0.25 x the mic of ciprofloxacin. incubation with ciprofloxacin did not alter the expression of the k. pneumoniae loci involved in  resistance to aps. a 1-n-phenyl-naphthylamine assay showed that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased the permeabilities of the k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa  outer membranes, while divalent cations antagonized this action. finally, we demonstrated that ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased the binding of aps to  the outer membrane by using dansylated polymyxin b.

TI  == bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in trinidad.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to provide a trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated  pathogens, and patient outcome. methods: this was a six-year retrospective study  of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the san fernando general hospital, trinidad. results: seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. the predominant isolate was staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and enterobacter spp (11.1%). the remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. the mortality rate was highest for p. aeruginosa (39.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and escherichia coli (19.2%). of the six cases due to neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. the overall mortality rate for the study period  was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. all deaths due to p. aeruginosa and e. coli occurred in neonates. almost 90% and about half of all s.  aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. more than 95% of k. pneumoniae and more than  87% of haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. group b streptococci  were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed  >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. of the 40 strains of s. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) >or=4 microg/ml (resistance) and 12.5% had a mic=2.0 microg/ml (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (mic between 0.12 and 1 microg/ml) and 25.0% showed resistance (mic >or=2 microg/ml) to penicillin. conclusion: the bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. an unusually high level of bacteremia with gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. relatively high-level resistance of s. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. the drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.

AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren and 14 other comparator agents against 1025 isolates of major respiratory tract pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial isolates  were collected from 11 asian countries. the majority of s. pneumoniae isolates (98.8%) were susceptible to cefditoren. the mic(50) and mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) of s. pneumoniae were <or=0.06 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. these values were 2-32-fold lower than those of the other cephalosporins. activity against s.  pneumoniae was observed irrespective of penicillin or macrolide resistance. cefditoren was also active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (100% susceptible; mic(90)=1 microg/ml), h. influenzae (100% susceptible; mic(90)<or=0.016 microg/ml) and m. catarrhalis (mic(90)=0.016 microg/ml). however, the cefditoren mic(90) of k. pneumoniae reached only 64 microg/ml (81.4% susceptible), which may be due to the high incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in asian countries. therefore, cefditoren should be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in asian countries.

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia in shanghai, china: microbial etiology and implications for empirical therapy in a prospective study of 389 patients.
AB  == the aim of this multicenter study was to identify the causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in shanghai, china, and to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. pathogens obtained from 389 patients with documented cap during 2001-2003 were identified by multiple diagnostic tools that included bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and specific immunological assays. susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was tested by the  broth microdilution method. a specific pathogen was identified in 39.8% (155/389) of the patients: haemophilus influenzae (n=80), klebsiella spp. (n=15), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=12), staphylococcus aureus (n=6), moraxella catarrhalis (n=1), other gram-negative organisms (n=9), and atypical pathogens that comprised mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=42), chlamydia pneumoniae (n=17), and legionella pneumophila (n=2). most h. influenzae isolates were susceptible to ampicillin (88.3%), and all were susceptible to macrolides. of the s. pneumoniae  isolates, 75% (9/12) were susceptible to penicillin, while 25% (3/12) were intermediately susceptible. h. influenzae and atypical pathogens are among the most important pathogens of cap. ampicillin, cephalosporins, and the newer fluoroquinolones can be used as empirical therapy for cap in the shanghai area. the efficacy of monotherapy with newer macrolides for cap caused by s. pneumoniae requires further evaluation.

TI  == [using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  == acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. the bacteria involved are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus. however, gram-negative rods, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and  methicillin resistant s. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. no data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the  management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of  bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis in qatar.
AB  == objective: to study the changes in the epidemiology, clinical and bacteriological profiles of bacterial meningitis in the era of the haemophilus influenzae type b  (hib)vaccine and pneumococcus resistance. methods: this is a retrospective study  of children aged <12 years admitted to the hamad medical corporation, qatar between january 1998 through december 2002 with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. results: we described 64 patients with culture proven bacterial meningitis. in infants <3 months (n=29 [45%]), the most common organism was group b streptococcus (gbs) (20%). children >3 months (n=35 [55%]); hib (25%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (stp) (20%) were the most common organisms before introduction of hib vaccination. a significant drop of hib infections were noticed after introduction of the vaccine. fever, neck stiffness, seizure, vomiting, and bulging fontanel were the most frequent presenting features. group  b streptococcus were sensitive to ampicillin and cefotaxime with no resistance detected. forty percent of stp isolates were resistant to penicillin and 12% were resistant to ceftriaxone. fifty percent of hib were resistant to ampicillin; while none of hib were resistant to ceftriaxone. no case of listeria monocytogenes meningitis was diagnosed. morbidity was 28%, and one patient expired (2%) after klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis. streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with the highest morbidity (62%) while hib had zero morbidity in our patients. conclusion: bacterial meningitis is a serious illness with a significant morbidity and mortality. haemophilus influenzae type b infection decreased which indicated an effective vaccination. as there is 12% bacterial resistance of stp reported against ceftriaxone; we recommend cefotaxime for infants <3 months while ceftriaxone plus vancomycin as empiric therapy for older  patients with community acquired bacterial meningitis. a pneumococcal vaccination may further decrease the incidence of meningitis in our community. a continuos surveillance to detect changes in the microbiology of organisms causing bacterial meningitis or their sensitivity in our community is essential to update these recommendations.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == respiratory tract infection caused by bacteria (non-mycobacterium) and their antibiogram in hiv-positive patients.
AB  == abstract. this study was undertaken from 1995-2000 to investigate the cause of respiratory tract infection among 481 patients with human immunodeficiency virus  (hiv) at siriraj hospital, bangkok, thailand. the positive rate of bacterial pathogens was 38.46%. pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared to be the most common pathogen (32.97%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (18.92%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.81 %), haemophilus influenzae (7.57%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5.95%). p. aeruginosa was sensitive to netilmycin, amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin (67-84%). s. aureus was sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin (100%).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  == emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae  (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being  0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that  tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.

TI  == the antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonias (cap) are still caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, or moraxella catarrhalis. legionella and chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing cap. klebsiella causes cap primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission  to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. the factors that determine the severity of a cap are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe cap in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. a critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is  not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. therefore the treatment of cap,  whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of cap. the most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g.,  levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe cap in the ccu.

TI  == etiology of community acquired pneumonia among adult patients requiring hospitalization in taiwan.
AB  == background: there has not been a comprehensive multi-center study investigating the microbial profile of community acquired pneumonia (cap) in taiwan. methods: a prospective study of adult cap patients requiring hospitalization between december 2001 and april 2002 was carried out in 13 hospitals in taiwan. etiology  was determined based on laboratory data from blood and sputum cultures plus serology from paired serum and urine antigen detection tests. results: etiology was assigned to 99 (58.9%) of the 168 patients having the most complete data for  etiology determination, with mixed infection in 21 (12.5%) patients. more than half (51.8%) of the patients were>60 years and 63.7% of the patients were males.  the most common etiologic agent was streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 23.8%), the majority (60%, 24 cases) of which was detected by positive urine antigen test. other common agents included mycoplasma pneumoniae (24, 14.3%), chlamydia pneumoniae (12, 7.1%), influenza a virus (11, 6.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8, 4.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (8, 4.8%). the prevalence of s. pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae was highest in patients>60 years (25/87, 28.7%), and<44 years (12/59, 19%), respectively; while k. pneumoniae comprised a larger proportion (4/22, 18%) in the 45-59 years group. conclusions: s. pneumoniae was the most common etiology agent in adult patients hospitalized due to cap in taiwan and the spectrum of other major pathogens was similar to studies conducted elsewhere in the world. empiric treatment recommendations developed in other parts of the world may be appropriately adapted for local use after taking into account local  resistance profiles. our data also support the recommendation that urine antigen  test be added as an adjunct to adult cap etiology diagnosis protocol.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in hong kong: 10-years' experience.
AB  == objective: we studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban chinese city over a 10-years period. methods: we reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital.  the clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded. results: sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. the four most common causes were mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), streptococcus suis (9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. the  annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001, or=38.84, ci=7.33-205.80). conclusion: the causative organisms found in this region of china differ from that reported from europe and the us; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe copd with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  == the susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (fqs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in japan during 2002. methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, the family of enterobactericeae, haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to fqs. the rate of fqs-resistant mrsa was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of fqs-resistant mssa. the fqs-resistance rate of mrcns was also higher than that of mscns, however, it was lower than that of mrsa. no fqs-resistant clinical isolates of salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. thirteen of escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of  proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl),  furthermore 6 of 13 in e. coli, 1 of 8 in k. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 esbl-producing isolates, and in p. mirabilis were fqs resistant. attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of esbl in relation to fqs resistance.  the rate of fqs-resistant p. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (uti) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (rti) were resistant. imp-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of p. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of s. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or s. aureus was not found.

TI  == cefdinir: an oral alternative to parenteral cephems.
AB  == cost savings are possible if oral cephems of equivalent efficacy can be substituted for parenteral cephems. an in vitro study was performed to compare the activity of cefdinir, cefoxitin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against 243 clinical isolates of human pathogens. activities were determined by national committee for clinical laboratory standards microbroth dilution methodology using an inoculum of approximately 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml. cefdinir was the single or equally most potent agent against streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that produced a variety of beta-lactamase types. cefdinir was less potent than ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against haemophilus influenzae, but was 2- to 8-fold more potent than cefoxitin and 8- to 32-fold more potent than cefazolin. cefdinir was slightly less potent than ceftazidime, against beta-lactamase-positive moraxella catarrhalis. these data support clinical consideration of cefdinir as an alternative to parenteral cephems in infections where adequate tissue levels can be safely assured.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy in community-acquired pneumonia among emergency patients in a university hospital in japan.
AB  == as antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia has not been well established in japan, this study was designed to obtain a more definitive standard for antimicrobial treatment of this condition. two hundred and thirty-one emergency patients admitted to kyorin university hospital between january 1998 and december 2000 were retrospectively analyzed in respect to their age, underlying disease, causative organism, and primary treatment with antimicrobial agent. furthermore,  the severity and prognosis were analyzed for those patients who had not responded to initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. the majority of the patients were elderly (over 65 years old; mean overall age 66.7 +/- 15.2 years) and had severe  pneumonia; underlying diseases were recognized at a high rate in patients with severe pneumonia (p < 0.05) and in those classified as elderly (p < 0.0001). the  most common underlying conditions in elderly patients were respiratory, cardiovascular (p < 0.01), and cerebrovascular (p < 0.05) diseases. the most common causative organisms were haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in patients with severe pneumonia, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the most common causative organisms. complications associated with  antimicrobial treatment were observed in those patients with k. pneumoniae isolates who also had severe pneumonia and were frequently treated with penicillin. furthermore, increased mortality rates were observed in patients not  responding well to the initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. thus, the selection of appropriate initial antimicrobial agents is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == incidence and etiological agents of bacterial meningitis among children <5 years  of age in two districts of romania.
AB  == to expand upon the limited comprehensive population-based data for childhood bacterial meningitis in eastern europe, the present study was conducted in the iasi and constanta districts of romania. from march 2000 through march 2002, children <5 years of age hospitalized for bacterial meningitis were enrolled in a prospective surveillance study. a total of 56 cases of bacterial meningitis were  identified, including 37 due to neisseria meningitidis (22 per 100,000 per year), 13 due to haemophilus influenzae type b (7.6 per 100,000 per year), and six due to streptococcus pneumoniae (3.5 per 100,000 per year). of the 31 meningococcal isolates that were serotyped, 12 were serogroup a, eight were serogroup b, and 11 were serogroup c. among all cases of bacterial meningitis, 25 occurred in children <1 year of age, including those due to meningococci (n=14), h. influenzae type b (n=7), pneumococci (n=3), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1). in romania the incidence of h. influenzae type b meningitis is similar to that found in other areas of southern and eastern europe during the pre-vaccination era, and the incidence of meningococcal meningitis is one of the highest yet found in europe. an unexpectedly high proportion of these meningococcal meningitis cases is due to serogroup a. disease burden could be substantially reduced through the  introduction of h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine and, when available, meningococcal conjugate vaccine protective against serogroups a, b and c.

TI  == rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the usa, canada, germany, france, and italy were studied using the the surveillance network (tsn) database. among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (mic>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (italy) to 36.2% (usa); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (germany) to 63.8% (france). the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae  among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (italy and germany) to 38.4% (usa). among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  ranged from 7.2% (canada and germany) to 27.3% (italy). the prevalence of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (germany and france) to 29.6% (italy). with the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with mrsa, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. meropenem was  the most effective agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. low  levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability  of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mic90 of mepm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. mepm showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa. mepm was active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse). 2. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae. carbapenems including mepm were active against these esbl strains. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == otitis media: treatment with intranasal aerosolized surfactant.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the objective was to determine the effect of intranasal surfactant alone and with other medications administered by metered dose inhaler  aerosol on the function of the eustachian tube and on the resolution of experimentally induced otitis media with effusion (ome) and acute otitis media (aom). study design: randomized, experimental, controlled animal studies. methods: previously unreported (experiment 4) as well as published (experiments 1-3) data were detailed so that the reader could understand the continuum of information leading to the conclusions. in experiment 1, after a live-animal technique of measuring eustachian tube passive opening pressure was developed and validated, eustachian tube passive opening pressure was determined in 61 adult gerbils and 34 mice at baseline and 5 and 10 minutes after delivery of aerosolized intranasal metered dose inhaler surfactant. in experiments 2 and 3 (klebsiella pneumoniae), lipopolysaccharide-induced ome was developed in gerbils. thirty-five animals were randomly assigned to control, placebo, surfactant, surfactant with betamethasone, and surfactant with phenylephrine groups. seventy  animals were randomly assigned to control, placebo once daily (qd) and twice daily (bid), surfactant qd and bid, surfactant with betamethasone qd and bid, and surfactant with phenylephrine qd and bid groups. intranasal aerosolized mdi medications were administered from postinfection day 2 until the effusion resolved. otomicroscopy and tympanometry were performed on alternate days for 30  days. in experiment 4, aom was developed in 39 chinchillas via transbullar injection of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae on day 1. thirteen animals each received placebo bid or surfactant bid, beginning on day 1. thirteen animals received surfactant bid beginning on day 3. all administrations were continued for 10 days. examinations were performed on seven occasions until day 27. appropriate statistical measurements were employed, including one- and two-way anova, strength-of-association measure (omega) calculation, chi, and newman-keuls post hoc multiple comparison tests. significance was set as p value of less than.05. results: in experiment 1, a significant reduction in passive opening pressure was seen in both 5- and 10-minute postsurfactant measurements. propellant alone was not effective. in experiments 2 and 3, ome resolved after an average period of 16 to 16.5 days in control, placebo qd and bid, and surfactant  with phenylephrine qd groups. a significant decrease in ome days was seen in the  surfactant qd (10.57 d) and bid (8.57 d), and surfactant with betamethasone qd (8.57 d) and bid (6.3 d) groups. a significant increase was seen in the phenylephrine bid group (18.67 d). in experiment 4, tympanometry was normal or near-normal in 62% and 48% of treated ears and in only 24% of placebo ears on day 12. sixty-seven percent of placebo ears were culture positive at day 27, compared with 10% and 16% in surfactant groups 1 and 2. seventy-five percent of untreated  animals developed severe labyrinthitis, compared with 15% in groups 1 and 2. on day 27, 58% of placebo group middle ears had fluid, whereas 61% and 62% of ears in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were dry. these findings were significant. conclusion: intranasal application of aerosolized metered dose inhaler surfactant alone or with steroid reduced eustachian tube passive opening pressure in normal  animals and duration of effusion in animals with experimental ome. intranasal surfactant reduced the severity and duration of middle ear infection in aom in this animal model.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  == objective: subperiosteal abscess (sa) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (am). of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated  from the sa. we suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess  cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of am. the purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause sa and mastoid cortex erosion in children. material and methods: the medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for sa between may 1984 and april 2002 were  evaluated. results: mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses purulent discharge was obtained from the sa cavity in 28 cases. the commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae. hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. conclusions: mastoid sa is a unilateral disease that can recur. early administration of anti-staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with sa as a complication of am.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
AB  == from october 2001 to september 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 69, streptococcus pneumoniae 72, haemophilus influenzae 85, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, klebsiella pneumoniae 32, moraxella subgenus branhamella  catarrhalis 32, and others. of 69 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 43.5%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 2000. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 59.7% and both rates of pisp and prsp were the highest after 1992. carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially,  panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity against h. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. against p. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with mic90 of  2 micrograms/ml. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the mic90s were 4 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong  activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/ml  or less. the drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). as for the incidence by the diseases,  bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (19.3%) and s. pneumoniae (19.9%). in contrast, h. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (20.8%) and h.  influenzae (21.5%). s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while s. aureus increased. the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. the bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. from the patients  who had already treated with macrolides, s. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while s. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.

TI  == argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers  showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but  only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only  67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial  drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == bacterial pathogens and outcome determinants of childhood pyogenic meningitis in  ilorin, nigeria.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy remainsjustifiable in childhood pyogenic meningitis (cpm), but the continuing efficacy in a particular setting requires periodic microbiological surveillance. it was this need that informed the present five-year retrospective study of consecutive admissions for cpm at the emergency  paediatric unit (epu) of the university of ilorin teaching hospital, ilorin, nigeria. of the 71 cerebro-spinal fluid [csf] analyses, 41 (57.6%) were gram-smear positive (gsp). gram-positive cocci (gpc) were identified in 23 (56.1%) smears, while 14 (34.2.%) had gram-negative bacilli (gnb). only three (7.3%) had gram-negative diplococci (gnd). despite corroborative biochemical findings, the remaining 30 (42.3%), including two with tuberculous meningitis proved smear-negative. gpc cases had a mean age of 4.49 +/- 5.3yrs, gnb, 3.06 +/- 4.8yrs and gnd, 4.47 +/- 4.9yrs. csf isolates were made in 28 (39.4%) cases. streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for a predominant 22 (78.6%) (p = 0.00), haemophilus influenzae for 2 (7.1%), and neisseria meningitidis for only 1 (3.5%) case. whereas strept. pneumoniae and h. influenzae isolates were uniformly sensitive to each of sultamicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, 7.7% of strept. pneumoniae were resistant to crystalline penicillin, 6.7% to ampicillin, and 69.2% to chloramphenicol; one of the two h. influenzae isolates was chloramphenicol-resistant. amongst the 30 (42.3%) fatal cases, the length of  stay was significantly shorter in gnb-positive cases (p = 0.045). mortality was significantly higher amongst cases with purulent/turbid csf at admission (p = 0.03), and in those with csf protein of >150mg/dl (p = 0.02) and glucose <1mg/dl  (p = 0.047). the present aetiological preponderance of gpc and strept. pneumoniae in our study population, the high case-fatality, and the emerging resistance profile suggest the need for exploring additional control options including vaccination. we emphasize the need for periodic auditing of local antimicrobial policies in cpm.

TI  == contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
AB  == grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90),  2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.

TI  == levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in esrd and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == the emulsiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the ability of the emulsiv filter (ef) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. methods: aliquots of staphylococcus aureus  (s. aureus), candida albicans (c. albicans), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), moraxella osloensis (m. osloensis), enterobacter agglomerans (e. agglomerans), escherichia coli (e. coli), serratia marcescens (s. marcescens), moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis), haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 ml  of sterile propofol. the unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. ten millilitres and 20 ml samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the ef. all solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro l calibrated platinum loop and incubated. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were counted. data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. results: the ef was able to completely remove cfu of s. aureus, c. albicans, k. pneumoniae, m. osloensis, e. agglomerans, e. coli, s. marcescens, and m. catarrhalis (p < 0.05). a small number of h. influenzae cfu were able to evade filtration in both the 10 ml and 20 ml samples. c. jejuni cfu  were able to evade filtration in only the 10 ml sample. conclusions: the ef removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of h. influenzae and c. jejuni. although the ef is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by h. influenzae and c. jejuni, a few cfu are capable of evading filtration. consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.

TI  == amoxicillin-sulbactam: a clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

AB  == antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. in the community  setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. for patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while  in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in north america. in this study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the united states and 5 in canada). over 30 species of organisms were recovered with staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%,  klebsiella spp. 7.5% and haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all s. aureus isolates. antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%)  activity against s. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. north american isolates of p. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). overall, 32.1% of s. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against s. pneumoniae. klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%.  the beta-lactamase-positive rate in h. influenzae was 28.6% in north america (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program continues to identify important north american patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.

TI  == national surveillance programme on susceptibility patterns of respiratory pathogens in south africa: moxifloxacin compared with eight other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == aims: the susceptibility patterns of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes isolated from specimens submitted to 12 private laboratories in south africa were determined. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determinations were performed on the isolates in the microbiology laboratory at tygerberg hospital according to the recommendations of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: according to the nccls breakpoints, 24% of 729 s pneumoniae isolates were sensitive, 30% intermediate, and 46% resistant to penicillin. rates of macrolide resistance were high, with 61% of the pneumococci being resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. co-trimoxazole resistance was also high, with 28% of pneumococcal strains being sensitive, 21% intermediate, and 51% resistant. beta lactamase was produced by 7% of 736 h influenzae isolates and 91% of 256 m catarrhalis isolates. the quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were universally active against all isolates tested, which included s pneumoniae, h influenzae, m catarrhalis, k pneumoniae, and s pyogenes. conclusions: haemophilus influenzae and s pneumoniae  were the most commonly isolated organisms. resistance to penicillin was one of the highest reported in the world (76%) in s pneumoniae, as was macrolide resistance in pneumonocci, although surprisingly, only 14% of s pyogenes were resistant. the quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were active against all organisms tested, including the penicillin and macrolide resistant strains and moxifloxacin was more active than levofloxacin against pneumococci.

TI  == role of surface-exposed loops of haemophilus influenzae protein p2 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains several proteins, and some  of these proteins, the porins, have numerous biological functions in the interaction with the host; porins are involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways and, in particular, in the activation of the raf/mek1-mek2/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade. the p2 porin is the most abundant outer membrane protein of haemophilus influenzae type b. a three-dimensional structural model for p2 was constructed based on the crystal structures of klebsiella pneumoniae ompk36 and escherichia coli phoe and ompf. the protein was readily assembled into the beta-barrel fold characteristic of porins, despite the low sequence identity with the template proteins. the model provides information on the structural features of p2 and insights relevant for prediction of domains corresponding to surface-exposed loops, which could be involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways. to identify the role  of surface-exposed loops, a set of synthetic peptides were synthesized according  to the proposed model and were assayed for mek1-mek2/mapk pathway activation. our results show that synthetic peptides corresponding to surface loops of protein p2 are able to activate the mek1-mek2/mapk pathways like the entire protein, while peptides modeled on internal beta strands are unable to induce significant phosphorylation of the mek1-mek2/mapk pathways. in particular, the peptides corresponding to loops l5 (lys206 to gly219), l6b (ser239 to lys253), and l7 (thr280 to lys287) activate, as the whole protein, essentially jnk and p38.

AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (banan), mics of cefpodoxime (cpdx, an active form of banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22  species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001  were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. in this study, remarkable change in the activity of cpdx was observed in streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus  influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before banan was launched. this cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated  in 1989 when banan was launched. other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. however, cpdx showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against prsp. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and moraxella catarrhalis, cpdx also showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its  marketing. against quinolones-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, cpdx showed excellent activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml. against members of the family  enterobacteriaceae except for citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, cpdx showed good activity. however, in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. proteus spp., and providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including cpdx. against peptostreptococcus spp., mic90 of cpdx was 8 micrograms/ml and its mic range was  widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml, which were similar to those in  the studies before its marketing. in this study, cpdx showed the decrease in the  activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, cpdx maintained good activity. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.

TI  == naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary iga levels.
AB  == lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. a study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary iga directed against surface antigens bacteria  frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus pyogenes (spy), morraxella catarrhalis (mc), haemophylus influenzae (hi), and streptococcus pnumoniae (spn). in 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific iga antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. in the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had iga directed, respectively, to kp and sa, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. we found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary iga in the adult than in the pediatric  population for all the microorganism evaluated. in addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific iga at oropharingeal level was kp. interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. these results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == from october 2000 to september 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial  agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 73, haemophilus infiuenzae 99, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 25, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. of  78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 53.8%. vancomycin and arbekacin  had the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 1999. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). prsp accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity  against h. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. tobramycin had a strong activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. the mucoid  strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had  strong bactericidal activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being mic80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml  or less. the drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (18.3%) and s. pneumoniae (16.1%). in contrast, h. infiuenzae (20.4%) and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were s. pneumoniae (24.3%) and h. infiuenzae (26.7%). the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated h. infiuenzae did not. the frequency of isolated p. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. the isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. in the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, p. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral beta-lactam antibiotics as a two-dimensional approach to their efficacy.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. for beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the mic. dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the mic for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. this is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. a combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the mic for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the mic for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. a european resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. studies were conducted in italy, spain and austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the nccls-recommended broth microdilution method. among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against gram-negative respiratory pathogens. pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. these data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers  in europe, north and latin america participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or amp c cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci  (vre). piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (mic50) against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including c. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. a specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. the carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the esbl-producing species of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp c enzymes including citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. piperacillin/tazobactam  only exhibited modest activity against the "amp c resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, mic < or = 64 microg/ml). piperacillin/tazobactam (mic50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. against sampled haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant),  piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. these in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. the potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract  pathogens acquired in the community setting.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  == aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and moraxella catarrhalis (3). a total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (h influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the predominant anaerobes included prevotella species (8), peptostreptococcus species (6), and fusobacterium species (4). these findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of bacteria isolated in patients with non-tb respiratory disorders, in order to find the frequency of germs isolated globally and in each of the 6 clinical syndromes: suppurations, chronic obstructive diseases exacerbations (copd, bronchial asthma), pneumopathies, post-tb syndromes, tumors and interstitial lung diseases. we found the greatest global frequency in anaerobes (35%). this is in concordance with the high frequency of broncho-pulmonary suppurations (51% of the cases studied). in second place comes ps. aeruginosa (18%), followed by str. pneumoniae (16%), h. influenzae (11%) and klebsiella pn. (10%). considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while ps. aeruginosa is first in post-tb syndromes (50%) and copd exacerbations (21%),  equal to h. influenzae. in pneumonias, str. pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by h. influenzae (25%). the susceptibility testing of strains of klebsiella and ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == evidence for a true post-beta-lactamase-inhibitor effect of clavulanic acid against klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate and characterize in vitro the post-beta-lactamase inhibitor effect (plie) of clavulanic acid against two beta-lactamase-producing species of bacteria. methods: the plie was investigated  against one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae and one strain of haemophilus influenzae. a stationary-phase inoculum of about 107 colony-forming units per ml  of each bacterium was pre-exposed for 2 h to clavulanic acid, either alone or in  combination with amoxicillin at various concentrations. after pre-exposure, the dilution required to remove the beta-lactamase inhibitor was 1:100 or 1:1000 according to the bacterial species and their susceptibilities to clavulanic acid. bacteria were counted hourly after drug removal, on solid agar medium. results: control cultures exposed to amoxicillin alone after dilution, showed a delay in growth, which may be inherent to the time required to synthesize sufficient beta-lactamase after the dilution steps. control experiments clearly distinguished the post-antibiotic effect and the growth delay from the plie. conclusion: the plie could be one of several factors explaining why beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations remain effective throughout the dosing interval, even if a few hours after in vivo administration, serum concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitor fall below levels that are active in vitro.

TI  == low frequency of bacteraemia during eye surgery obviates the need for endocarditis prophylaxis.
AB  == purpose: to determine the incidence of bacteraemia following eye surgery, and thereby evaluate the need for antibiotic cover during such procedures, in patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis. methods: this prospective study involved 50 consecutive patients undergoing extraocular surgery at the sultan qaboos university hospital, muscat, oman. local preparation of the surgical site in all patients included pre-operative instillation of 0.3% gentamicin and 3% povidone-iodine eye drops. two eye swabs (one from the conjunctival sac and another from the eyelid margin) and two venous blood samples (one taken just before the procedure and the second 10 min into it) were collected and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. surgery-related bacteraemia was defined as a negative pre-operative blood culture followed by a positive intraoperative blood culture of the same bacterium identified in the positive eye swab. results: only two patients (4%) demonstrated surgery-related bacteraemia: one caused by staphylococcus epidermidis (following entropion correction) and the other by haemophilus influenzae (following dacryocystorhinostomy). four other patients had positive conjunctival swabs without bacteraemia, the causative organisms being haemophilus influenzae in two, and staphyloccus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae in one each. conclusion: ophthalmic surgery is not associated with significant bacteraemia, and therefore  does not mandate routine antibiotic cover in patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. stringent pre-operative preparation of the surgical site may suffice to minimise bacteraemia; however, this requires further study.

AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy.  adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45  &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == postantibiotic effects of eleven antimicrobials on five bacteria.
AB  == aim: to investigate the postantibiotic effects (pae) of different classes of antimicrobials against five different types of bacteria. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by twofold macrodilution in broth. the antimicrobial agents were eliminated by washing method after the bacteria were exposed to antimicrobials for 1 h or 2 h. growth curves were followed by viable counts, and then the pae were calculated. results: macrolides  induced pae of 3.10 h to 4.15 h on s aureus, and 1.85 h to 3.3 h against s pneumoniae, which were longer than pae induced by other tested antimicrobials (p<0.01). macrolides induced pae of 1 h to 4 h against h influenzae, with azithromycin producing the longest pae of 4 h. ciprofloxacin and amikacin induced pae of 1.38 h to 2.00 h on e coli and k pneumoniae, which were longer than that of beta-lactams, piperacillin, cefazolin, or cefotaxime, with pae of 0.1 h to 0.5 h (p<0.01). conclusion: different classes of antimicrobials induce different periods of pae. as an important pharmacodynamic parameter, pae provide reference  data for the determination of the optimal dosing regimen and reasonable use of antimicrobials.

TI  == carriage of gram-negative bacilli in young brazilian children with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == background: gram-negative bacilli are not infrequently encountered as etiologic organisms of pneumonia in children in warm-climate countries. objectives: to investigate the nasopharyngeal carriage rate and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli colonizing children with community-acquired pneumonia in fortaleza, brazil. methods: a single nasopharyngeal specimen was collected from children 2 months to 5 years of age presenting at one of the three children's hospitals in fortaleza and fulfilling the world health organization criteria for pneumonia. randomly recruited healthy children from public daycare centers and immunization clinics served as controls. results: the study included  912 children, 482 (53%) with pneumonia and 430 (47%) controls. aerobic gram-negative bacilli were seen in 79 (16%) of the 482 children with pneumonia and 51 (12%) of the 430 healthy controls. nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were seen in 85 (18%) of children with pneumonia and 54 (13%) of healthy controls. neither gender, nutritional status, season, previous hospital admission nor antibiotic use was associated with carriage with gram-negative bacilli. however, pneumonia was associated with increased carriage, whereas concomitant colonization with streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae was associated with decreased carriage with gram-negative bacilli. only 36% of all escherichia species and 76% of all klebsiella isolates were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; 90% of all acinetobacter species were susceptible to gentamicin. conclusion: nasopharyngeal carriage with gram-negative bacilli, in particular with acinetobacter species, is common and associated with a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in children in fortaleza, brazil.

TI  == low cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42 in patients with acute bacterial meningitis and normalization after treatment.
AB  == csf-a beta 42 may be a marker of alzheimer's disease (ad). a decreased level of csf-a beta 42 is consistently found in ad and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. however, low csf-a beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance creutzfeldt-jakob disease. to examine if the level of a beta 42 in csf is related to inflammatory processes, we studied csf-a beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and  18 age-matched controls. in acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, p<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. after successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level increased (p<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). the decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing  volumes of serum did not influence the csf-a beta 42 levels. our findings suggest that the reduction in csf-a beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. the cause may be disturbance of the clearance of a beta 42 from the brain.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of ertapenem (mk-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. the purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from  locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act  in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency  noted for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/ml) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. less ertapenem activity was seen against pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (mic50 16 microg/ml). except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic90 0.03 microg/ml; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic90 2 microg/ml; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 < or =0.015 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). ertapenem was also very potent against haemophilus influenzae  (mic90 0.25 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. these results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with  a possible role against some emerging resistant species.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of gar-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == gar-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. the purpose of this study was to determine the activity of gar-936 against a range of gram-positive and -negative  bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). six hundred four bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci collected as part of the sentry surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. gar-936 was also tested against an additional 176 gram-negative cocci isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were esbl-producers. broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. presence of an esbl-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. gar-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of gram-positive cocci, with an mic range of <or=0.015-1 microg/ml, and mic(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae to 0.25 for s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. mics against the 176 gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/ml), with mic(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/ml. the activity of gar-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of esbls. the activity of gar-936 was particularly impressive against gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic(90)s for gar-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against s. pneumoniae and enterococci.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
AB  == from october 1999 to september 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 101, haemophilus influenzae 104, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 41, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. of 78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 57.7%. vancomycin and  arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa without detection of abk-resistant strain (mic: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of vcm-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998.  the frequency of prsp was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. carbapenems showed strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs showed strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. mics of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all h.  influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with  mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. number of isolated p. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for  ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. the drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with mic of  0.063 microgram/ml. on the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. the percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in  the last year. as for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. they were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients,  respectively. in 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. it was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. we examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. in patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. however, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased  to 2/3 of the total in 1999. on the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were h. influenzae in 28.4%, s. pneumoniae in 25.7%, m. (b.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and s. aureus in 10.6%. the frequency of s. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. however, that of h. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many h. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.

TI  == regulation of matrilysin expression in airway epithelial cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin.
AB  == matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase-7) is expressed by mucosal epithelia throughout the body and functions in host defense by activating murine intestinal alpha-defensins. in normal adult human lung, matrilysin is expressed at low levels in the airway epithelium, but is markedly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis  (cf). because cf lungs support a heavy bacterial load, we assessed if relevant cf pathogens regulate matrilysin expression in human lung epithelial cells. indeed,  acute infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa (but not staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, or klebsiella pneumoniae) induced the expression of matrilysin in calu-3 lung epithelial cells. increased matrilysin mrna levels were detectable at 3 h post-infection and peaked at a 25-fold induction between 6 and  8 h. both p. aeruginosa cf isolates and laboratory strains induced matrilysin expression to similar levels. flagellin, the monomeric precursor of bacterial flagella, was identified as the inductive factor released by p. aeruginosa that regulated matrilysin expression. in addition, flagellin-null mutants failed to stimulate matrilysin expression in cultured cells or in lungs infected in vivo. these data show that p. aeruginosa (and specifically flagellin) potently stimulates matrilysin expression in lung epithelial cells and may mediate the overexpression of this proteinase in cf lungs.

AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

(19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

AB  == thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate (tga; cas 20192-91-0) is widely used for the treatment of infections of varied aetiology. the aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate (tg; cas 15318-45-3), tga, amoxicillin (cas 61336-70-7) plus clavulanic acid (cas 58001-44-8), azithromycin (cas 83905-01-5) and ceftriaxone (cas 104376-79-6). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) were determined against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) methods. the effects of changes in assay conditions  were also examined. the activity of tg and tga was similar to that of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, with the exception of methicillin resistant s. aureus. azithromycin and ceftriaxone were characterised by a limited activity against gram-positive cocci and methicillin resistant and cefinase-positive s. aureus, respectively. tg and tga are characterized by a wide spectrum of activity, comparable to that of recent commercialized antibiotics for treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-a (sp-a) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  == some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. an important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is sp-a, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of sp-a  (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the  bronchial epithelial cell line, wi26va4. cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high  efficacy, mainly at 1/2 mic, in reducing the adherence of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on s. aureus and s. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on s. pneumoniae. other similar results were observed with netilmicin on klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). clarithromycin reduced the adherence of k. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain.  adherence of the test strains was not modified by sp-a alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.

TI  == [clinical analysis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization classified by age group].
AB  == we classified 1017 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization experienced in kawasaki medical school kawasaki hospital during the past 15 years into five age groups (< or = 54 years old, 55-64 years old, 65-74 years old, 75-84 years old, > or = 85 years old). with particular emphasis  on the elderly patients, we then compared the clinical and microbiological findings in the five groups. the results were as follows; (1) half of patients in the over 85 years old group were bed-ridden. (2) the proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) there were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) there were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) the number of polymicrobial agents in the < or =  54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and streptococcus pneumoniae  in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) the isolation rate of mssa, gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) the amount of sepsis increased with  age. (11) the prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the  mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.

TI  == effect of some fractions of alveolar surfactant (phospholipids and sp-a) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and sp-a) on the  bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. methods: the antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin,  depending on their specific activity, were investigated against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 mic, sp-a at 1 and 5 mg/l and phospholipids at 50 mg/l. results: time-kill experiments showed that while sp-a never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on p. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 mic, with an increase of about 1 log in cfu. the combination of sp-a and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. conclusions: the paucity of  data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. cefepime  alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 mic, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.

AB  == sc-002 is a novel oral cephalosporin possessing a unique thiadiazolylethenyl moiety at the 3 position. in the present study, it was the most active against gram-positive bacteria among oral cephalosporins such as cefdinir (cfdn), cefpodoxime, cefditoren and cefaclor (ccl). it was equal to or 16 times more active than cfdn against standard and clinical strains. in particular, against clinical isolates of morganella morganii and haemophilus influenzae, sc-002 was 8-64 times more active than cfdn. the antibacterial activity of sc-002 against some beta-lactam-resistant strains was superior to that of cfdn. the in vivo antibacterial activity of sc-004, a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of sc-002, was 1.2-8  times more protective against systemic infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae than that of cfdn. the therapeutic effects of sc-004 on experimental respiratory tract infections caused by s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae were superior to those of cfdn and ccl. sc-004  showed higher and longer-lasting blood levels and higher urinary excretion in pharmacokinetics in mice.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 41 antimicrobials tested against over 2773 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with pneumonia: i--results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998).
AB  == pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. knowledge  of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. during the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the united states [us], and five in canada [can]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. the 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted  of a total of 35 species, with staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. in the us, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in can (4.1%; p = 0.001). the us isolates of s. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible  strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. p. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the us and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. among the us isolates of enterobacter spp.,  only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. isolates from can were generally more susceptible, except for pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. the sentry program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.

TI  == risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  == objective: to determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. design: prospective cohort study. setting: the trauma intensive  care unit (icu) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. patients: all critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between november 1995 and october 1996. interventions: a comparison of data recorded at the time of icu admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. measurements and main results: the presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/ml) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and  radiologic signs. twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. the mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. the microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, enterococcus spp., enterobacter spp.,  coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use  of h2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (ct) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. the mortality rate was 43.5%  (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). also, the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the therapeutic intervention  scoring system) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). in the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. conclusions: it seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of icu admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. in this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. at the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of  this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.

TI  == seven-year study of bacteraemic pneumonia in a single institution.
AB  == in order to enhance current knowledge of nosocomial and community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia in a single tertiary hospital in israel, a 7-year study was conducted. using a computerised database, all patients who had bacteraemic pneumonia from march 1988 to august 1995 were studied. during the study period, pneumonia was the source of bacteraemia in 319 of 4,548 (7%) episodes, occurring  in 295 patients; 211 (66%) episodes were community-acquired and 108 (34%) were nosocomial. the microoroganisms isolated most frequently from patients with community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia were streptococcus pneumoniae (46%), staphylococcus aureus (10%) and haemophilus influenzae (8%); while pseudomonas spp. (17%), klebsiella spp. (11%) and staphylococcus aureus (10%) were isolated most often from the patients with nosocomial bacteraemic pneumonia. the median age of patients was 68 years (range, 0.003-100). the overall mortality was 34%. no significant difference was found between the mortality rates of patients with  community-acquired (31%) and nosocomial (40%) bacteraemic pneumonia (p=0.1). multivariate analysis showed that hypothermia, respiratory failure, impaired consciousness, tracheal intubation, staphylococcus aureus aetiology, septic shock, inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment and age significantly increased mortality.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == comparative activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone against respiratory pathogens  in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simulating concentration-time curves.
AB  == the duration of time that serum levels are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; t >mic) seems to be an important pharmacodynamic parameter for beta-lactams. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone in a pharmacokinetic model mimicking the concentrations in bronchial mucus and in serum (total and free) obtained at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h, after 1 g i.m. administration once daily. the species investigated were respiratory pathogens (1 strain of staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain b-lactamase negative and 1 strain beta-lactamase positive of haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of escherichia coli and 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae); mic50s of the chosen strains were reported. in this in vitro model the concentrations (serum and bronchial mucus) for both antibiotics are generally at or above the mic values of the tested strains until 24 hours. the killing curve showed rapid killing for both antibiotics: 99.9% killing (a 3-log reduction in growth) within 6 to 8 h, depending upon the microorganism tested. there was no significant difference in the log kill between cefodizime and ceftriaxone. these data confirm that t >mic for beta-lactams is the pharmacodynamic parameter which best correlates with bactericidal efficacy. on the basis of the killing curve determined for cefodizime versus ceftriaxone at concentrations that these antibiotics can reach  during therapy with 1 g i.m. once daily we expect reasonable clinical efficacy with monoadministration of cefodizime as well as for ceftriaxone in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of transport and utilization systems for hexuronides,  hexuronates and hexonates in gamma purple bacteria.
AB  == the comparative approach is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene regulation in bacterial genomes. it can be applied to the analysis of regulons that have been studied experimentally as well as that of regulons for which no known regulatory sites are available. it is assumed that the set of co-regulated genes  and the regulatory signal itself are conserved in related genomes. here, we use genomic comparisons to study the regulation of transport and utilization systems  for sugar acids in gamma purple bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia pestis, erwinia chrysanthemi, haemophilus influenzae and vibrio cholerae. the variability of the operon structure and the location of the operator sites for the main transcription factors are demonstrated. the common metabolic map is combined with known and predicted regulatory interactions. it includes all known and predicted members of the gntr, uxur/exur, kdgr, uidr and idnr regulons. moreover, most members of these regulons seem to be under catabolite repression mediated by crp. the candidate uxur/exur signal is proposed, the kdgr consensus is extended, and new operators for all transcription factors are identified in all studied genomes. two new members of the kdgr regulon, a hypothetical atp-dependent transport system ogtabcd and yjgk  protein with unknown function, are detected. the former is likely to be the transport system for the products of pectin degradation, oligogalacturonides.

AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program began in january, 1997, and is designed to monitor nosocomial and selected community acquired infections via a worldwide surveillance network of sentinel hospitals distributed equally by geographic location and size. three sites in brazil - rio de janeiro, florianopolis, and sao paulo - participated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program stet. rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, wound or skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time. antimicrobial susceptibilities of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis obtained from outpatients with respiratory tract infections were also evaluated. the isolates for the evaluated infections were: 1) bloodstream - 20 consecutive isolates in each calendar month during a 12-month period; 2) pneumonia - 100 consecutive isolates over a 6 month period; 3) wound or skin and soft tissue - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period; and 4) uti - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period. each hospital also contributed, over a 6 month period, consecutive  clinically significant outpatient isolates (one isolate per patient) of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis that were considered pathogens in respiratory tract infections. data collected for each isolate included species identification, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, date of isolation, and specimen type. molecular studies were performed on selected isolates. a total of  1,241 bacterial strains were obtained; the majority were cultured from hospitalized patients, while 139 were fastidious organisms from community acquired respiratory tract infections. gram-negative bacilli and s. aureus were the predominant pathogens, and enterobacter spp. was a significant pathogen. the  predominance of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. and the significant levels of resistance to most agents are of major concern, as is the epidemic rate of esbl-producing strains of klebsiella spp. and e. coli in brazil, which is much higher than rates seen in other areas of the world. resistance among p. aeruginosa and the enterobacteriaceae to fluoroquinolones, oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant pneumococci were other significant resistance issues identified in this surveillance study. vancomycin resistance among the enterococci, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae was not identified. this benchmark study will serve as comparison for future surveillance studies, including the ongoing sentry program, to monitor emerging resistance trends in brazil. the high rates of resistance observed in this study underscore  the need for global surveillance and local action.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of this article was to determine the outcome, clinical and prognostic features, and microbiology of a large group of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) presenting in septic shock. materials and methods: the placebo limb of the norasept ii database was examined. data were collected on patients in septic shock with a diagnosis of cap who presented to a  participating site from home. results: one hundred and forty-eight patients met the study criteria. the 28-day survival was 53%. one hundred and four pathogens were isolated from 77 (52%) patients with 24 (16%) patients having polymicrobial  infections. the most common pathogen was streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (18%), haemophilus influenzae (14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). infection with p aeruginosa or acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality (82%). the only clinical variables recorded in the database that could identify patients with pseudomonas  or acinetobacter infection was a history of alcohol abuse. comorbidities were present in 74% of patients, involving predominantly the cardiorespiratory system. logistic regression analysis demonstrated apache ii score and serum interleukin 6 (il-6) concentration to be significant independent predictors of mortality. patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection had significantly higher il-6 levels and significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels when compared with the rest of the cohort of patients. conclusion: a diverse spectrum  of both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were implicated in patients with cap presenting in septic shock, necessitating broad spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage. this coverage should include antipseudomonal activity, particularly in alcoholic patients. severity of illness (apache ii score) and il-6 levels were important prognostic factors. infection with p aeruginosa and acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml.  the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin  (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in  1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70  years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia.  administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus  13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days.  the frequencies of h.

TI  == respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the united states [us]; eight in canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory  standards. the five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). there was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the us and canada for s. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most  active antimicrobial agent against p. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. against h. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the s. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of amp c cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. in conclusion, important differences exist between the us and canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

AB  == each 20 strains of beta-lactamase producing methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis group were used as the test strains. drug susceptibility of these strains to faropenem  (frpm), cefdinir, cefditoren, cefcapene, cefteram, cefaclor, and ampicillin was determined by an agar dilution method according to the nccls guideline m100-s9. beta-lactamase activity of the test strains was determined by a spectrophotometric method. in the present study, frpm was highly active against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and no close correlation was found between the  mics of frpm for the test strains and their beta-lactamase activities. these results suggest that frpm has potential in successful application for the treatment of infectious diseases with various types of bacterial pathogens including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

AB  == differentiation between in situ infection and simple tumor necrosis in cavitating lung tumors by means of imaging studies is difficult. in this study, we prospectively investigated the role of ultrasound (us)-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacteriologic examination of infected cavitating lung tumors, and  the influence of the culture results on the treatment of patients. twenty-two patients (18 men and four women) with cavitating lung tumors treated from january 1996 to october 1998 were included. all patients underwent us-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. microorganisms were isolated from six of seven febrile patients and one of 15 nonfebrile patients. a total of nine pathogens were isolated from seven patients: klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); haemophilus influenzae (n = 2); enterococcus faecium (n = 1); bifidobacterium (n = 1); shewanella putrefaciens (n = 1); and mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1). two pathogens were isolated from the aspirate cultures in two patients, while the others had monomicrobial infection. the six febrile patients who had positive lung aspirate cultures were treated with empiric antimicrobial agents before the culture results were available, and the culture results led to adjustment of the antibiotic regimen in five of these. the clinical conditions of the six patients with infected cavitating lung tumors improved after the initiation of individualized antimicrobial treatment. pneumothorax occurred in one patient, and was the sole procedure-related complication. in conclusion, us-guided transthoracic aspiration is helpful for differentiating infected cavitating lung tumors from simple tumor necrosis. infection in cavitating lung tumors is common among febrile patients, and the culture results can guide modification of the antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

TI  == [clinical analysis of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in a community hospital--comparison of elderly and non-elderly patients].
AB  == a comparative study of 890 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in a community hospital was performed. the patients were divided  into an elderly patient group and a non-elderly patient group. the elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia exhibited frequent atypical symptoms such as dyspnea, consciousness disturbance and complication of shock, and also were frequently in a poor nutritional condition. the causative microorganism was  isolated in 40.8% of the elderly patients and in 44.0% of the non-elderly patients. polymicrobial agents were detected frequently in the elderly patients.  streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4%), mssa (16.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (15.1%) and haemophilus influenzae (15.0%) were frequently isolated from the sputum of the elderly patients, while mycoplasma pneumoniae (25.2%), h. influenzae (15.0%), s.  pneumoniae (12.2%) and mssa (10.2%) were frequently isolated from that of the non-elderly patients. regarding treatment with antibiotics, therapy with a single antibiotic therapy, such as cephem or carbapenem was carried out for the elderly  patients, while new quinolone or tetracycline was administered to the non-elderly patients. although the treatment with antibiotics was adequate according to the guidelines of the american thoracic society, the prognosis was poor; i.e.) in the elderly patients an efficacy rate of 74.3% and a mortality rate of 9.5%. in the non-elderly patients, the prognosis was good; i.e.) an efficacy rate of 88.0% and a mortality rate of 1.7%. these results suggest that the most important factors affecting the prognosis were the general condition of elderly patients and delay  in an adequate diagnosis and treatment because of atypical clinical findings.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == [development of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria and the impact of resistance on therapy].
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotic is the inevitable consequence of the utilization of antimicrobial agents all over the world, particularly in developed countries. it is particularly evident with beta-lactam agents because they are among most frequently prescribed drugs. the resistance is mainly attributable to  production of various types of beta-lactamases but other mechanisms like alterations in pbp molecules or in outer membrane proteins can play a significant role. increased resistance can be seen among fastidious gram-negative bacteria like haemophilus influenzae or moraxella catarrhalis. the percentage of m. catarrhalis isolates producing beta-lactamases has increased to over 90%. among enterobacteriaceae e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pose a very serious problem  because of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases which confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. the percentage of ampicillin resistant e. coli among hospital isolates has rosen to 78% in u.s.a. nowadays. recently, the emergence of e. coli strain resistant to combination of amoxycillin and clavulanate, due to hyperproduction of tem-1 beta-lactamase, was observed. inducible beta-lactamases mediate beta-lactam resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa which often develops during therapy of p. aeruginosa infections. imipenem resistance is increasingly prevalent among p. aeruginosa isolates nowadays, but can be detected in k. pneumoniae due to the production of novel beta-lactamases and changes in outer membrane proteins.

TI  == carrier properties of a protein derived from outer membrane protein a of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == we have recently cloned a new protein, recombinant p40 (rp40). when tested in vivo after conjugation to a b-cell epitope, rp40 induces an important antibody response without the need for adjuvant. to characterize its potency, this carrier protein was coupled to a peptide derived from respiratory syncytial virus attachment g protein (g1'). after immunization of mice with the rp40-g1' conjugate, strong antipeptide antibodies were detected, whereas peptide alone was not immunogenic. to emphasize the carrier properties of rp40, a polysaccharide derived from haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) was coupled to it. immunoglobulin g responses against the hib polysaccharide were observed after coupling to rp40. interestingly, an antipeptide antibody response was observed despite preexisting anti-rp40 antibodies generated by preimmunization with rp40.  in addition, rp40 compares well with the reference carrier protein, tetanus toxoid (tt), since antibody responses of equal intensity were observed when a peptide or a polysaccharide was coupled to tt and rp40. moreover, rp40 had advantages compared to tt; e.g., it induced a mixed th1/th2 response, whereas tt  induced only a th2 profile. together, the results indicate that rp40 is a novel carrier protein with potential for use as an alternative carrier for human vaccination.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

AB  == antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (cemt) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were investigated in comparison with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics during the period from january to march, 1998. the results are summarized as follows; 1. cemt showed strong antimicrobial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. however, antimicrobial activities of cemt against penicillins (pcs)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcs-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were slightly weaker than those of some of the reference antibiotics. 2. no chronological changes of cemt-mic level were observed in the antimicrobial activities against s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis or klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. in contrast to this, due to the increase of pisp and prsp strains, resistance to cemt appears increasing with time.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous  year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the  sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa  (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients  showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere

TI  == [in vitro demonstration of a true post-beta-lactamases inhibitor effect (plie) of clavulanic acid on klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == in vivo, serum concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitors measured during the last part of the dosing interval are below the levels associated with in vitro activity. nevertheless, beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations remain active in vivo throughout the dosing interval. one of the many reasons for this contradiction may be the plie. the plie can be evaluated only in the light of the postantibiotic effect (pae). also, accurate determination of the plie requires a careful investigation of all bacterial regrowth delays (brds) inherent to the technical procedures used. the purpose of the study reported herein was to determine the true in vitro plie of clavulanic acid (ca) against two beta-lactamase-producing strains, a klebsiella pneumoniae strain (amoxicillin [amx] mic > 256 mg/l; ca mic = 64 mg/l; and amx + ca mix = 4 mg/l) and a haemophilus influenzae strain (amx mic = 32 mg/l; ca > 32 mg/l; amx-ca = 1 mg/l). for each strain, a stationary phase inoculum of 10(7) was preexposed for 2 h to either ca alone or ca + amx in various concentrations. dilution to 10(-2) or 10(-3) was performed to eliminate the ca and/or amx after the preexposition phase. hourly bacterial counts were done between 0 and 8 h and after 24 h. control cultures exposed to amx after dilution showed a growth delay possibly ascribable to the time needed for bacteria to produce a large enough amount of beta-lactamases. control experiments were done to unequivocally differentiate plie from pae and brd. the true plie values thus obtained ranged from 0 to 4.5 h  for k. pneumoniae and from 0 to 15 h for h. influenzae. for both strains, a plie  was demonstrated after exposure to ca alone.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == susceptibility of european respiratory tract isolates to trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ampicillin.
AB  == as part of the artemis project, 11500 isolates (3000 from patients with respiratory tract infections) were collected throughout six european countries between 1994 and 1996. twenty-seven hospitals or laboratories participated in this first phase of the study. the activities of three classes of antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam agents, macrolides) are presented for the six most frequently isolated pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae). overall, trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin activities were  similar for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. of the streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 6% were resistant  to penicillin. trovafloxacin had the highest activity against the streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.25 mg/l for 90% of isolates (mic90); all strains tested were susceptible to trovafloxacin. the mic90 of ciprofloxacin for streptococcus pneumoniae was 3 mg/l, and overall 52% of the strains were susceptible; 9% were resistant. azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited similar activity against all collected pathogens, except haemophilus influenzae. all strains of haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to azithromycin compared with 79% for clarithromycin, with respective mic90s of 2 and 16 mg/l. the data presented demonstrate differences in the susceptibility patterns of six major respiratory tract pathogens in europe.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1996)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 16 institutions around the entire japan, 557 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 449 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1996 to september 1997. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 98 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 93 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 84 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 84 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 17 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 31 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 21 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 67.3%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased comparing to the previous year's 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activities  against both s. aureus and mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. faropenem (frpm) showed the next potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. the other drugs except erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and tetracycline (tc) were active against s. pneumoniae tested with mic80s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. 3) h. influenzae the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested with mic80s  of 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cefmenoxime (cmx), cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) tobramycin (tob) showed the most  potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs), ipm, gentamicin (gm), abk and  ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the next potent activities, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) tob and cpfx showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80s of piperacillin (pipc) and cefoperazone (cpz) were 16 micrograms/ml in 1995, and they were 64 micrograms/ml in 1996. 6) k. pneumoniae all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. cmx, cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and carumonam (crmn) showed the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m.(b) catarrhalis against m.(b.) catarrhalis, all drugs showed good activities with mics of 4 micrograms/ml or below. ipm and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activities with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to  year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examined for 557 isolates  from 449 cases. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 71.0% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportions of diagnosed diseases were as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 35.9% and 30.3% respectively. they were followed by bronchiectasis with a proportion of 10.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (haj) season in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence and type of rti-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. method: a total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (haj to makkah al-mukarama, saudi arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. all 761 throat swabs of both haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause  respiratory infections. results: bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. during the 1991 haj season haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). in the 1992 haj season klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. cultures from the  761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza a and adenovirus being the most common viruses. conclusion: the pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza a and adenovirus predominated. thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.

AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == should third-generation cephalosporins be the empirical treatment of choice for severe community-acquired pneumonia in adults?
AB  == the choice of empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is highly controversial. our survey of 42 australian emergency department doctors showed that monotherapy with a third-generation cephalosporin was the preferred regimen for severe cap (14/42; 33%). we argue that cheaper regimens with a narrower spectrum are likely to be just as effective as third-generation cephalosporins and will have fewer adverse effects on the microbial ecology of hospitals. we suggest penicillin or ampicillin (to cover pneumococci--even if penicillin "resistant"--and haemophilus influenzae), plus a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin or erythromycin; to cover legionella and other "atypical" pathogens), plus a single large dose of an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin; to cover gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae) as empirical therapy for severe cap.

TI  == the infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  == infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is  the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. in patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. the use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection,  with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by pneumocystis, listeria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, nocardia, candida, aspergillus, and herpesviruses. further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

AB  == a citrate lyase (ec 4.1.3.6) was purified 25-fold from leuconostoc mesenteroides  and was shown to contain three subunits. the first 42 amino acids of the beta subunit were identified, as well as an internal peptide sequence spanning some 20 amino acids into the alpha subunit. using degenerated primers from these sequences, we amplified a 1.2-kb dna fragment by pcr from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. this fragment was used as a probe for screening a  leuconostoc genomic bank to identify the structural genes. the 2.7-kb gene cluster encoding citrate lyase of l. mesenteroides is organized in three open reading frames, citd, cite, and citf, encoding, respectively, the three citrate lyase subunits gamma (acyl carrier protein [acp]), beta (citryl-s-acp lyase; ec 4.1.3.34), and alpha (citrate:acetyl-acp transferase; ec 2.8.3.10). the gene (citc) encoding the citrate lyase ligase (ec 6.2.1.22) was localized in the region upstream of citd. protein comparisons show similarities with the citrate lyase ligase and citrate lyase of klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. downstream of the citrate lyase cluster, a 1.4-kb open reading frame  encoding a 52-kda protein was found. the deduced protein is similar to citg of the other bacteria, and its function remains unknown. expression of the citcdefg  gene cluster in escherichia coli led to the detection of a citrate lyase activity only in the presence of acetyl coenzyme a, which is a structural analog of the prosthetic group. this shows that the acetyl-acp group of the citrate lyase form  in e. coli is not complete or not linked to the protein.

TI  == molybdate transport and regulation in bacteria.
AB  == molybdate is transported in bacteria by a high-affinity transport system composed of a periplasmic binding protein, an integral membrane protein, and an energizer  protein. these three proteins are coded by moda, modb, and modc genes, respectively. the moda, modb, and modc proteins from various organisms (escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, azotobacter vinelandii, and rhodobacter capsulatus) are very similar. the lowest km value reported for molybdate in the molybdate transport process is approximately 50 nm. in a mod mutant, molybdate is transported by the sulfate transport system or by a nonspecific anion transporter. molybdate transport is tightly coupled to utilization in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while other dinitrogen-fixing organisms appear to have a molybdenum storage protein. in all organisms studied so far, molybdate transport genes are regulated by a repressor protein, mode. the mode-molybdate complex binds to the sequences tayat (y = t or c) in the operator/ promoter region in e. coli and prevents transcription of the modabcd operon. the  mode-molybdate complex binds to dna as a homodimer in e. coli and possibly in other organisms as well. in r. capsulatus, however, two mode homologues (mopab proteins) are required for repression.

TI  == isolation of the putp gene of corynebacterium glutamicum and characterization of  a low-affinity uptake system for compatible solutes.
AB  == corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates the compatible solutes proline, glycine betaine, and ectoine under conditions of high osmolality. uptake of proline is mediated by both a high-affinity and a low-affinity secondary transport system. the low-affinity uptake system also accepts glycine betaine and ectoine as substrates. in the present study, the gene encoding the high-affinity proline uptake system putp was isolated by heterologous complementation of escherichia coli mutant strain wg389, which lacks the transport systems bett, putp, prop, and prou and is unable to synthesize proline and glycine betaine. this gene (putp) encodes a protein of 524 amino acids that shares identity with the proline transport systems putp of e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. functional studies of putp synthesized in e. coli mutant strain mkh13, which also lacks the transport systems for compatible solutes and is unable to synthesize glycine betaine, revealed that this carrier system is not regulated by the external osmolality on  the level of activity. km values of 7.6 mm for proline and 1.3 mm for sodium as cotransported ion were determined. deletion of the putp gene allowed the functional characterization of another proline uptake system with low affinity.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of  0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed  the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1  microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k.  pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at  4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below.  ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe

TI  == kinetics of specific salivary iga responses in man after oral challenge by ribosomal immunostimulant.
AB  == the kinetics of specific iga mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. the levels of iga specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. this study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. the kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity  of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. in the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. resistance to penicillin among s. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. recent studies in the united states have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is  a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with  increasing frequency in enterobacteriaceae, primarily klebsiella spp. fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.

TI  == bacterial ghosts as multifunctional vaccine particles.
AB  == expression of cloned phix174 gene e in gram-negative bacteria results in lysis of the bacteria by formation of an e-specific transmembrane tunnel structure built through the cell envelope complex. bacterial ghosts have been produced from a variety of bacteria including escherichia coli. salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio cholerae, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and helicobacter pylori. such ghosts are used as non-living candidate  vaccines and represent an alternative to heat or chemically inactivated bacteria. in recombinant ghosts, foreign proteins can be inserted into the inner membrane prior to e-mediated lysis via specific n-, or c-, or n- and c-terminal anchor sequences. the export of proteins into the periplasmic space or the expression of recombinant s-layer proteins vastly extents the capacity of ghosts or recombinant ghosts as carriers of foreign epitopes or proteins. oral, aerogenic or parenteral applications of (recombinant) ghosts in experimental animals induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses against bacterial and target components including protective mucosal immunity. the most relevant advantage of ghosts and  recombinant bacterial ghosts as immunogens is that no inactivation procedures that denature relevant immunogenic determinants are employed in the production of ghosts used as vaccines or as carriers of relevant antigens. the inserted target  antigens into the inner membrane or into s-layer proteins are not limited in size.

AB  == a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. this trial involved 327 patients (168 ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. the main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. an additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (p = 0.001). the protective effect of ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% ci: 0.43-0.78, p = 0.0001). analysis of secondary criteria also favored ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; p = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; p = 0.002).

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) of amoxicillin-clavulanate was studied for strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. a pae of approximately 2 h was seen  for beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of s. aureus following 2 h of exposure to twice the mic and did not increase at 16 times the mic. the pae observed with h. influenzae was clearly related to the growth rate of the organism. a pae of 0.8 h was found for amoxicillin (four times the mic) against a beta-lactamase-negative strain of h. influenzae (generation time, 26.3 min) and a pae of 1.74 h was found for amoxicillin-clavulanate (twice the mic) against a beta-lactamase-positive strain (generation time, 32.2 min). when the beta-lactamase-positive strain was growing more slowly (generation time, 120 min), the pae of amoxicillin-clavulanate increased to > 3.32 h. the pae of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2/1 micrograms/ml on a beta-lactamase-producing strain of m. catarrhalis was > 2.9 h, and, as expected, the paes of twice the mic on k.  pneumoniae and e. coli were generally short (< 1 h). the post-beta-lactamase inhibitor effect (plie), determined after removal of only clavulanate, was also examined for beta-lactamase-positive strains. this was more prolonged (approximately 3 to 4 h) than the corresponding pae for s. aureus, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. the plie was related to the amount of beta-lactamase produced and required the presence of amoxicillin in the initial exposure period. these data may have implications for reducing the dosage of amoxicillin-clavulanate.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

AB  == causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to jikei university hospital from 1975 to 1994. eighty patients (50.6%)  were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. the average mortality rate was 18.4%. the mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. staphylococcus  aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). h. influenzae, acinetobacter sp., streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus (gbs) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). the mortality rate of klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), s. aureus (24.1%), s. pneumoniae (22.2%). h. influenzae and acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. e. coli and gbs were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. h. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., and acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. e. coli, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and gbs were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infectious complications are major contributing factors to morbidity and mortality in the icu setting. organisms frequently encountered in the icu include pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae (particularly in trauma victims), enterococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumanii, escherichia coli, and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia. antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment  of infections caused by such bacterial pathogens. organisms have responded to the antibiotic challenge, however, evolving and developing resistance to all available antimicrobial agents to a greater or lesser degree. specific mechanisms of resistance include reductions in cell-wall membrane permeability, alterations  of antimicrobial agent target sites, enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, and development of bypass pathways around antimicrobial targets. this article describes, pathogen by pathogen, antimicrobial agents that are useful for the treatment of infection in the icu setting and the mechanisms whereby bacteria have short-circuited our antimicrobial armamentarium.

TI  == a multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the alexander project.
AB  == the alexander project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. fifteen centres, ten in the european union (eu) and five in the usa, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of mics of 15 antimicrobials using the sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. of the total of 6385 isolates collected, haemophilus influenzae (2718), streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. staphylococcus aureus (690). haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified  less commonly. high-level penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae (mic > or = 2 mg/l) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in germany, italy, uk and two of the five usa centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in france and spain. intermediate penicillin resistance (mic 0.12-1 mg/l) was identified in 228 isolates of s. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (eu, 0-52.3%; usa, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of h. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in weingarten, germany in 1993 to 38.5% in barcelona, spain in 1992. in general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in usa centres than in those of the eu. beta-lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of m. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. of the 690 collected, most isolates of s. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. isolates from two centres, genoa, italy in 1992 and paris, france in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). combined isolates of h. parainfluenzae and k. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued  to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.

TI  == clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. this investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in north america. cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that  of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. the bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. the most common pathogens isolated were escherichia coll, streptococcus pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and  streptococcus, group b. overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. cefepime and  ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. the most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. the results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  == the effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. with buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae, (p < 0.015). with m.catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (p > 0.05). exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates  of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. the drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s.aureus. on the contrary, synthesis of lipase, dnase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (s.aureus), pneumolysin (s.pneumoniae), streptolysin s, dnase, and protease (s.pyogenes), capsule (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (k.pneumoniae, h.influenzae and m.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) of the drug. finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens e.coli, p.mirabilis and p.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. high molecular weight low-copy f'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy phsg298 plasmids were eliminated from e.coli treated with sub-mic concentrations of brodimoprim. the incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for f'lac to 23% for phsg298. f'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. when conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5xmic), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. the fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-mic levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.

TI  == increased plasma adenosine deaminase activity in the early phase of legionella pneumophila infection in guinea pigs.
AB  == we measured adenosine deaminase (ada) activity in a guinea pig model of legionella pneumophila infection. female hartley guinea pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with one-quarter of the ld50 dose of l. pneumophila philadelphia-1 strain. control groups were inoculated with clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. each group consisted of 5 animals. ada activity in plasma  was assayed calorimetrically before and at various intervals after infection by measuring the amount of ammonia produced after adenosine was added to plasma samples. ada activity before inoculation was 25.6 +/- 6.0 iu/1, it reached 174.4  +/- 60.0 iu/1 on day 3 after inoculation of l. pneumophila. ada activity returned to normal levels on day 14. ada activity did not increase significantly in guinea pigs infected with the other types of bacteria. these findings suggest that measurement of plasma ada activity may be useful for the diagnosis of legionella  infection.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  == bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of  haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most  potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than >  or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by

AB  == the serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. blood samples were  drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the  following organisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  serratia marcescens. the median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for s. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). this difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. the ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == aetiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children.
AB  == one-hundred-and-thirty-two children with clinical and radiological evidence of bronchopneumonia/pneumonia were studied over a 1-year period for isolation/detection of bacterial and viral aetiological pathogens. throat swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa), and lung aspirate were studied for bacterial and viral cultures. npa was also subjected to latex agglutination test (la) for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae; and immunofluorescent technique (ifat) and enzyme immunoassay (eia) for respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). blood culture for bacterial pathogens, and la of blood and urine was also undertaken. haemophilus influenzae was the commonest organism (15 per cent) isolated as the sole pathogen followed by rsv (14 per cent), klebsiella (13 per cent) and s. pneumoniae (12 per cent). e. coli was the commonest organism (50 per cent) in infants <3 months and  was closely followed by rsv (44 per cent), klebsiella (25 per cent), and s. pneumoniae (18 per cent). isolation rate of e. coli gradually declined with age.  rsv (47 per cent) and h. influenzae (31 per cent) were the commonest organisms between 7 and 24 months. s. pneumoniae and staph. aureus were common bacterial pathogens identified in all age groups with maximum isolation of 20 and 40 per cent, respectively, in children more than 5 years. isolation of e. coli, klebsiella and staph. aureus was highest from npa culture, while as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were most often detected by la. out of 12 cases from whom a lung aspirate was collected, bacterial pathogen could be isolated in six cases (50 per cent). detection of rsv by eia was higher than by culture or ifat. most of the organisms were resistant to chloramphenicol except for h. influenza. all the isolates of s. pneumoniae were sensitive to all the antibiotics. bacterial pathogens were isolated/detected in 74 per cent of cases and rsv was the aetiological agent in 49 per cent of cases investigated for viral aetiology. higher detection rate of rsv is attributed to selection of cases in winter months during a period of suspected epidemic of rsv.

AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == changing patterns of susceptibilities of blood, urinary and respiratory pathogens in hong kong.
AB  == the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from blood,  urine and respiratory specimens at a teaching hospital in hong kong were studied  retrospectively from 1986-1993. the incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), increased significantly from 33.6 to 47.3% (p < 0.001) while that of gram-negative bacteraemia fell from 60.0  to 47.0% (p < 0.001). among blood isolates, methicillin resistance of cns increased from 17.0 to 58.0% (p < 0.001) and cefuroxime resistance of enterobacter spp. increased from 21.0 to over 50% (p < 0.01). among urinary isolates, cefuroxime resistance of klebsiella spp. (11.0 to 24.0%, p < 0.001) and enterobacter spp. (32.0 to 75.0%, p < 0.001) increased. nalidixic acid resistance among gram-negative urinary isolates, except proteus mirabilis, rose by three- to sixfold. for streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated from the respiratory tract, penicillin resistance increased dramatically (2 to 18%, p < 0.001). for respiratory isolates of haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin resistance increased from 17.0 to 29.0% (p < 0.001). these data are useful in guiding empirical treatment of nosocomial infections.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

AB  == meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were compared in an open, randomised prospective multicentre study in the treatment of acute exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients. one-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were enrolled; 164 were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 98 for bacteriological efficacy, with 144 pathogens isolated. the predominant pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (n = 30), streptococcus pneumoniae (18), staphylococcus aureus (12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), moraxella catarrhalis (8), other gram-negative bacteria (neisseria, klebsiella, proteus, and enterobacter spp.) (53) and other gram-positive bacteria (12). a single bacterial pathogen was identified in 61 patients, whereas two bacterial pathogens were isolated in 31 patients and three in six patients. the clinical response at the end of treatment was very high in both groups with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 97.6% of the meropenem patients and in 96.3% of the imipenem/cilastatin patients; at follow-up the rates were 89.1% and 89.8%, respectively. the bacterial success (eradication or presumed eradication) was 88.2% in the meropenem group and 89.4% in the comparator group.  nausea or vomiting were reported more frequently in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin, whereas in the meropenem group an increase in aminotransferases was reported. one patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin was  withdrawn from the study due to seizures. meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were  highly effective for the treatment of severe bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but meropenem was better tolerated.

TI  == virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract  infections. haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and m. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. these bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), despite the specific antibodies present in  serum and sputum against the persistent strain. especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. among h. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane  protein composition vary. variation in s. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. between exacerbations, particularly h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with copd. recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with copd.

TI  == bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in benin city and ekpoma in edo state were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. species isolated comprised staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), proteus mirabilis  (17%), alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). others included escherichia coli (3.3%), proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter spp, proteus morgani, haemophilus influenzae, providencia spp, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. the study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. results have indicated that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.

TI  == third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  == in order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x mic, and 4 x mic of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml). the strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees c and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. the antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. at 4 x mic of cefetamet and at 10(5) cfu/ml  inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. at the same concentration of mic and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against s. pneumoniae within 4 h and against s. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml inocula. cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. the efficient  bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == expression of capsules by haemophilus influenzae in mixed infections.
AB  == the pathogenicity of eight clinical isolates of non-type b haemophilus influenzae was investigated by inoculating them subcutaneously into mice, alone or mixed with viable or non-viable bacteria of certain other species. three of the h. influenzae isolates were non-capsulated while five were slightly capsulated (less than 1% of organisms had capsules). the other strains of bacteria tested were four isolates of capsulated and four isolates of non-capsulated pigmented strains of prevotella sp. and porphyromonus sp. as well as a capsulate klebsiella pneumoniae ("helpers"). none of the non-capsulated strains induced an abscess when inoculated alone. following co-inoculation of viable or non-viable "helpers" with h. influenzae, abscesses were formed in all instances in which the "helper"  had a capsule. profusely capsulated cells of h. influenzae were recovered, however, only from abscesses induced with the five slightly capsulated strains of h. influenzae. these capsulated organisms were found serologically to be of type  b and induced abscesses when inoculated alone. our findings illustrate the ability of non-capsulated strains of h. influenzae to produce progeny of capsulated type b organisms after co-inoculation with certain other species.

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == a single daily dose of ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis in adults: experience with 84 patients and review of the literature.
AB  == although the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone allows its administration in a single daily dose, this practice is not standard in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. herein, we review our experience and that of other investigators with this mode of therapy. we used a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/[kg.d]; maximum, 4 g/d) for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in 84 adult patients. meningitis was due to neisseria meningitidis in 34 cases, to streptococcus pneumoniae in 25, to escherichia coli in three, to klebsiella pneumoniae in two,  to haemophilus influenzae in two, to viridans streptococci in two, and to an unknown agent in 16. eleven patients died, for an overall mortality of 13%; therapy failed in three additional cases. the mean trough levels of ceftriaxone in cerebrospinal fluid was 3.5 micrograms/ml; the median trough bactericidal titer at this site was 1:128. both our experience and that in the literature suggest that a single daily dose is optimal when ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == genomic organization of the klebsiella pneumoniae cps region responsible for serotype k2 capsular polysaccharide synthesis in the virulent strain chedid.
AB  == the genomic organization of the chromosomal cps region that is responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis in klebsiella pneumoniae chedid (o1:k2) was investigated. deletion analyses and southern hybridization studies suggested that the central region of the cloned 29-kb bamhi fragment is indispensable for k2 capsular polysaccharide synthesis. the 24,329-bp nucleotide sequence of the klebsiella cps region was determined and deposited in the embl and genbank databases through ddbj and assigned accession number d21242. nineteen possible open reading frames (orfs) were identified in the sequenced area. among them, 13  orfs are very close to each other. six of the 19 orfs show considerable nucleotide sequence similarities to salmonella typhimurium cpsg, cpsb, rfbp, and  orf2.8, escherichia coli gnd, and haemophilus influenzae bexd, respectively. moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf10 product demonstrated a highly hydrophobic profile and showed putative membrane topology similarity to rickettsia prowazekii atp/adp translocase. nucleotide sequence similar to the sigma 54-dependent promoter, as well as the usual -35 and -10 sequences, were identified just upstream of orf3, which is the first orf in the polycistronic structure. furthermore, a sequence (gggcggtagcgt) found just downstream of the sigma 54-dependent promoter-like sequence was generally conserved among gene clusters implicated in cell surface polysaccharide synthesis, such as salmonella  rfb and viab and e. coli kpsmt and rfaqpg. a possible transcriptional terminator  with a hairpin loop structure found just downstream of orf15 that is a homolog of e. coli gnd. k2 capsular polsaccharide biosynthesis in e. coli k-12 depends on cpsb (mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase gene), and klebsiella cpsb, found in  the downstream region of the polycistronic structure, was able to complement cpsb of e. coli. results of transposon insertion and promoter-cloning analyses were consistent with the results of nucleotide sequence analysis.

AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == pasteurella multocida produces a protein with homology to the p6 outer membrane protein of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == an antibody specific for a 16-kda outer membrane protein of a rabbit strain of pasteurella multocida was used to probe representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes of p. multocida, as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9, and all were shown to express the protein. the gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have extensive sequence homology with the gene encoding the p6 protein of haemophilus influenzae. the protein in p. multocida has been designated p6-like. the gene encoding the p6-like protein was used to probe members of the family pasteurellaceae and other gram-negative bacteria. representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes (as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9) of p. multocida hybridized with the p6-like gene under conditions of high stringency. the dna from h. influenzae hybridized weakly with the p6-like gene under these conditions, but pasteurella haemolytica (representatives of a and t biotypes), bordetella bronchiseptica, b. avium, actinobacillus suis, a. suis-like, a. lignieresii, a. ureae, a. rossii, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. equuli, and various members of the family enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium) did not hybridize detectably.  under conditions of lower stringency, the p6-like gene also hybridized strongly with dna from p. multocida, h. influenzae, and a. rossii but weakly with dna from p. haemolytica and members of the genus actinobacillus. these results suggest that the p6-like protein of p. multocida might be useful as an immunizing product to protect poultry from avian cholera. this suggestion stems from (i) our finding that the p6-like protein in p. multocida is widely distributed among all the somatic serotypes and (ii) the previous work of others demonstrating that the p6  protein of h. influenzae elicits a protective immune response in animal models of human disease.

TI  == pulmonary penetration of ceftazidime.
AB  == for an antibiotic to be effective in lower respiratory tract infections, it should be available in adequate concentrations in respiratory tissues and fluids. cephalosporins usually achieve modest concentrations in the respiratory tract. in this study we have determined the pulmonary penetration of intramuscularly administered ceftazidime (a single dose of 1 g). levels of ceftazidime in bronchial secretions (bs), bronchial mucosa (bm), epithelial lining fluid (elf),  and serum (s) were measured by microbiological assay in 25 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis who were divided into 5 groups of 5 subjects according to sampling time (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the administration of the antibiotic). the peak s level was high (39.89 +/- 10.42 micrograms/ml at 1 hour) and mean s concentrations decreased slowly and were still detectable at 12 hours (1.07 +/- 0.45 microgram/ml). in all other samples,  mean concentrations were in excess of the ceftazidime minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for many relevant respiratory pathogens (haemophilus influenzae 0.15 microgram/ml; moraxella catarrhalis 0.06 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae 0.15 micrograms/ml; klebsiella pneumoniae 0.4 microgram/ml). concentrations in bm (7.05 +/- 2.38, 8.14 +/- 2.23, 6.40 +/- 1.63, 4.06 +/- 0.99 and 0.45 +/- 0.27 microgram/g) were higher than that in bs (6.87 +/- 1.96, 6.54 +/- 1.84, 3.52 +/- 1.23, 1.56 +/- 0.92 and 0.23 +/- 0.19 microgram/ml).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
AB  == resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the united states. many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and,  in many cases, it is emerging resistance. resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing tem-1 beta-lactamase. a novel form of resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. many enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. thirty percent of haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative  staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. to minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.

TI  == evaluation of opc-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for  90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == to examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (cdtr) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from november, 1993 to february, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined including those of the control drugs. the results were as follows: 1. cdtr showed strong antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics of cdtr against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant s. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. cdtr showed strong antimicrobial activities against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, and klebsiella spp. the mic of cdtr against ceps-resistant e. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, cdtr will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == compartmentalization of specific b-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  == numerous studies have shown that peyer's patches (pp) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. this was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in pp, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. these data showed that pp export  considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their  specificity. in this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific b-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae or klebsiella pneumoniae. the data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. both  prior to and after oral challenge, specific b-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. they were mostly igg-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. these observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific b-cells after oral challenge.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == lactoferrin is a lipid a-binding protein.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf), a cationic 80-kda protein present in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in mucosal secretions, is known to have antibacterial effects on gram-negative bacteria, with a concomitant release of lipopolysaccharides (lps, endotoxin). in addition, lf is known to decrease lps-induced cytokine release by  monocytes and lps priming of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. its mechanism of action is incompletely understood. we have now demonstrated by in vitro-binding studies that lf binds directly to isolated lipid a and intact lps of clinically relevant serotypes of the species which most frequently cause bacteremia (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as to lipid a and lps of mucosal pathogens (among others, neisseria meningitides and haemophilus influenzae). binding to lps was inhibitable by lipid a and polymyxin  b but not by kdo (3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate), a glycoside residue present in the inner core of lps. binding of lf to lipid a was saturable, and an affinity constant of 2 x 10(9) m-1 was calculated for the lf-lipid a interaction. our data may explain, in part, the mechanism whereby lf exerts its antibacterial and anti-endotoxic effects. further studies on the ability of lf to block the detrimental effects of lps, both in vitro and in vivo, are warranted.

TI  == mucosal and systemic immunizations with killed pseudomonas aeruginosa protect against acute respiratory infection in rats.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the efficacies of prior mucosal (oral, intra-peyer's patch, or intratracheal) and systemic (subcutaneous) immunizations  with killed pseudomonas aeruginosa in clearance of an acute p. aeruginosa respiratory infection in rats. rats were immunized with paraformaldehyde-killed p. aeruginosa at various doses, and 2 weeks later, the rats were challenged with  a log10 dose of 8.7 live bacteria. this dose was fatal for unimmunized rats, with death occurring approximately 12 h after challenge. the numbers of surviving bacteria in the airways and lung tissue were determined by analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) and lung homogenate samples, respectively. enhanced bacterial clearance was associated with survival of intra-peyer's patch-immunized rats. determination of bacterial clearance in bal 4 h after challenge demonstrated that the use of all immunization routes led to significant clearance compared with the bacterial levels in unimmunized controls (the order of effectiveness was intra-peyer's patch > oral-intratracheal > intratracheal > subcutaneous > oral). bacterial clearance in the lung homogenate was also significantly greater for all immunization routes than in the unimmunized controls (the order of effectiveness was intra-peyer's patch > subcutaneous > oral-intratracheal > oral = intratracheal). prior oral immunization with killed p. aeruginosa also induced enhanced bacterial clearance of heterologous strains of p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and to a lesser extent, klebsiella pneumoniae. because of the ease of antigen delivery, oral immunization with killed p. aeruginosa may be an important route of immunization for induction of enhanced bacterial clearance of subsequent acute respiratory infection with p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  == during the period january 1980 to december 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to bangkok children's hospital was carried out. there were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group b streptococcus (11.7%), escherichia coli and enterobacter sp (10.4% each). in childhood meningitis, haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and salmonella sp (12.4%). excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p <  0.05). the overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal  meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. the fatalities of the two age  groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.

TI  == immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == we have investigated the local immune response of the balb/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. after two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. the procedure followed the principle of the classical elispot test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific iga synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas igg and igm production rates showed no remarkable differences. in addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific iga titers but not increased igm and igg levels. we conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced iga response in a  distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of cefodizime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone against respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefodizime and two comparative cephalosporins, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone were studied against respiratory pathogens. mic90s of  cefodizime were 0.06-0.512 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. mic50s of cefodizime for klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus isolates were 2 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml respectively. cefuroxime and ceftriaxone at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml inhibited 50% of klebsiella pneumoniae and 50% of staphylococcus aureus strains studied respectively. cefodizime inhibited many  of the important respiratory pathogens and can be suggested as an active antimicrobial agent for respiratory tract infections.

TI  == identification of a gene essential for piliation in haemophilus influenzae type b with homology to the pilus assembly platform genes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) pili are complex filamentous surface structures consisting predominantly of pilin protein subunits. the gene encoding  the major pilin protein subunit of hib adherence pili has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. in order to identify specific accessory  genes involved in pilus expression and assembly, we constructed isogenic hib mutants containing insertional chromosomal mutations in the dna flanking the pilin structural gene. these mutants were screened for pilin production, pilus expression, and hemagglutination. pili and pilin production were assessed by immunoassays with polyclonal antisera specific for pilin and pili of hib strain eagan. hemagglutination was semiquantitatively evaluated in a microtiter plate assay. six hib mutants produced proteins immunoreactive with antipilin antiserum  but no longer produced structures reactive with antipilus antiserum. in addition, the mutants were unable to agglutinate human erythrocytes. nucleotide sequence analysis localized the insertion sites in the six mutants to 2.5-kb open reading  frame upstream of the pilin structural gene and immediately downstream of an hib  pilin chaperone gene. the amino acid sequence encoded by this open reading frame  has significant homology to members of the pilus assembly platform protein family, including fhaa of bordetella pertussis, mrkc of klebsiella pneumoniae, and the escherichia coli assembly platform proteins fimd and papc. this open reading frame, designated hifc, appears to represent a gene essential to hib pilus biogenesis that has genetic and functional similarity to the pilus platform assembly genes of other gram-negative rods.

TI  == comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  == the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each  drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

(b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  == otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants,  mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. the rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. in acute otitis media the major organisms, present are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. in chronic otitis media these organisms, plus staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. the microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. empirical therapy can  be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. however, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. the growing resistance of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. by adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as pseudomonas spp. where present.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

AB  == in order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (cftm), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from july 1990 to june 1991 and from july 1992 to february 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. the obtained results are summarized below. 1. no cftm-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. it appeared that streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of escherichia coli were increasing. the former included benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae  (pisp) of pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. the mic's of beta-lactams against the above pisp or prsp, and against cephems-resistant e. coli tended to be high, but those  of cftm were relatively low (in most cases). 3. proportions of strains resistant  to cephems, including cftm among citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and providencia rettgeri were  high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. as mentioned above, cftm is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of mic90's, and as far as mic80's are concerned, cftm still is as active  as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.

TI  == adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in yaounde, cameroon.
AB  == a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. other etiologies were klebsiella  pneumoniae (3), streptococcus pyogenes (2) staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1) and moraxella catarrhails (1). patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. there were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. the causative agents in patients with failures were: klebsiella pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a  mild skin rash. due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.

AB  == common lots of reference mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in february-april 1992. five medical centers in the united states and canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). quality-control strains were processed concurrently, mics recorded, and data processed at a common location. selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and p. aeruginosa; (d) cross  resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. a retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  == the microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic  or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. aerobic bacteria were  isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). the predominant aerobic  or facultative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (58), escherichia coli (17), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and haemophilus influenzae (12). the predominant anaerobes were pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species (24), bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and fusobacterium species (20). beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. these included all 42 tested s aureus and 15 b fragilis group, 4 of 9 k pneumoniae, 3 of 9 h influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 e coli. most patients from whom s pneumoniae and h influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with s aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. these data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of acute lower respiratory infections in pre-school nigerian  children and comparative predictive features of bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic illnesses.
AB  == in a 9-month surveillance of the microbial agents causing acute lower respiratory infections (alri) in hospitalized preschool nigerian children, 24 bacterial isolates were made from 22 (33 per cent) out of 66 blood cultures, including seven (70 per cent) of the 10 cultures from subjects with pleural effusion. of the 24 positive isolates, staphylococcus aureus accounted for 14 (58 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae for four (17 per cent), streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus albus for two (8 per cent) each, and haemophilus influenzae for only one case. seven subjects had a mixed aetiology, comprising one bacteraemic case with measles and six with concomitant viral identifications. sixteen cases,  10 (63 per cent) of whom were malnourished, had two or more pathogens, including  10 with multiple viruses. bacterial isolates from the throat, were not significantly predictive of the alri aetiology. overt malnutrition, empyema, and  anaemia, were significantly commoner in bacteraemic cases (p < 0.03, 0.01, and 0.05), while rhinorrhoea and crepitations were each associated with the non-bacteraemic ones. (p = 0.05 and < 0.05). a similar association was shown between rhinorrhoea, wheezing/rhonchi and the mixed aetiological group (p < 0.05  and 0.05, respectively). the case-fatality in bacteraemic subjects, was 9 per cent and was 2.1 times higher than that for non-bacteraemic cases, in whom a shorter mean duration of admission was recorded. in developing countries, the need for periodic local surveillance of alri pathogens, as a prerequisite for evolving rational antimicrobial policies, is emphasized. our findings underscore  the predictive importance of malnutrition as a risk-factor of severe bacteraemic  alri, frequently associated with multiple pathogens. the relative usefulness of blood culture in identifying bacterial agents of alri is discussed.

TI  == the microbiology of acute and chronic sinusitis and otitis media:a review.
AB  == there exists no real controversy about the role of aerobic bacteria in acute sinusitis and in acute otitis media. the "infernal trio" streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis are by far the most  common pathogens in these acute infections. on the contrary, there is still much  debate about the normal flora of the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, although there are some reports of the presence of anaerobes and aerobes in the majority of the normal paranasal sinuses. in chronic sinusitis bacteriological cultures show a greater variation than those in acute sinusitis. nonetheless, it  is demonstrated in most studies that besides the "infernal trio" additional bacteria are present, including anaerobes and gram negative bacteria. in otitis media with effusion (ome) we find the same bacteria as in acute otitis media (aom) and a pathologic flora in the nasopharynx seems to be important for both aom and ome. in chronic otitis cultures are nearly always positive and reveal pseudomonas species, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, proteus species and anaerobes.

TI  == comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  == an open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary  pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. the combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). the control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to  4 gm q4h. the two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical  characteristics. among the 84 patients, organisms from the enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella species (14%), and serratia species (9%). other commonly identified organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), haemophilus influenzae (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and staphylococcus  aureus (8%). results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (p = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (p = 0.291). in the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were  72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (p = 0.359). duration  of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (p = 0.095), respectively. in addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (p = 0.086). all regimens were well tolerated, and  no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. this trial shows  that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. a well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.

AB  == we studied the penetration of cefuzonam (czon) into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) in 20 patients with neurosurgical diseases. influences of the presence of meningeal reaction and the intensity of brain damage on csf penetration of czon were also examined. concentrations of czon in serum and csf were determined using the thin-layer cup method before and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after 2 g of czon was administered intravenously. the serum concentration at 1 hour was 60.4 +/- 31.3 (mean +/- s.d.) microgram/ml, then rapidly decreased to 2.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. in contrast, the csf concentration gradually increased, reached a peak level of 0.319 +/- 0.313 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and then slowly decreased  to 0.273 +/- 0.249 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. the csf penetration ration: czon ([csf]/[serum]) was 5.6% at 4 hours. the peak csf concentration in patients with  meningeal reaction (0.465 +/- 0.364 micrograms/ml at 2 hours) was about 2-fold higher than that in those without the reaction (0.249 +/- 0.223 micrograms/ml at  4 hours). the peak csf concentrations in patients with slight, moderate, and severe brain damage were 0.231 +/- 0.133 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, 0.270 +/- 0.232 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and 0.680 +/- 0.467 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, respectively. csf penetration of czon was augmented in patients with meningeal reaction or severe brain damage. these findings indicate that the concentration of czon in csf after intravenous administration is sufficient for treatment of meningitis or infections after neurosurgical operations caused by such bacteria as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == treatment recommendations for respiratory tract infections associated with aging.
AB  == age-related changes, for example reduced elasticity and earlier airways collapse, predispose the elderly to respiratory infection. other factors such as a lifetime of smoking, the use of hypnotics, or the development of stroke also predispose. pneumonia becomes increasingly common with advancing age, and both morbidity and  mortality increase with associated disease burden. diagnosis of pneumonia may be  more difficult in the aged because of physiological changes. however, careful physical examination with accurate, regular recording of body temperature will usually reveal the characteristic features of pneumonia, which should be confirmed by chest radiograph. in the frail elderly, the onset of impaired function, such as confusion, immobility, falling or incontinence, should raise suspicion of infection. pneumonia is classified as community-acquired, nursing home-acquired or nosocomial, which helps in the empirical choice of antibiotics.  streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism in the community, then haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. gram-negative organisms like  klebsiella and escherichia coli are more common in nosocomial infections. nursing home patients with pneumonia tend to be more frail than those in the community. treatment is directed at eradication of the organism with the appropriate antibiotic, maintaining hydration and oxygenation, as well as managing impaired mobility, faecal loading, urinary incontinence and confusion. influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the frail elderly. tuberculosis remains an important diagnosis in the frail elderly and should always be considered, especially in patients with respiratory infection who fail to respond to conventional therapy.

TI  == importance of beta-lactamase stability in treating today's respiratory tract infections.
AB  == in respiratory tract infections streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis,  haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella spp. are the most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens. resistance of clinical s. pneumoniae isolates is known to be independent of beta-lactamase production, whereas resistance of the other species mentioned is due to beta-lactamase production. with respect to m. catarrhalis the first beta-lactamase-producing (bla+) isolate was detected in clinical specimens  in 1976 and now, 70-90% of all clinical isolates are bla+. the enzymes bro-1 and  bro-2 are transposon-mediated thus explaining their rapid spread; they hydrolyze  penicillin compounds very rapidly and, to a lesser extent, the older cephalosporins. resistance in clinical h. influenzae isolates is mainly due to the prevalence of the most widespread transposon-mediated beta-lactamase, tem-1,  which has a substrate profile resembling that of the bro enzymes. bla+ h. influenzae isolates make up to 6% of the total in northern europe, in southern europe up to 55% and in many african countries more than 80%. more than 95% of klebsiella spp. isolates possess a chromosomally encoded penicillinase and to a varying extent a plasmid-mediated enzyme in addition. recently, reports from several countries have pointed to the clinical relevance of 'extended-spectrum enzymes' derived by point mutation from the 'classical' tem-1 or tem-2 enzymes. these new enzymes (tem-3 to tem-21) exhibit a broadened substrate profile, inactivating even the oxyiminocephalosporins. the most stable compounds are ceftibuten and cefetamet. with respect to the future, these enzymes may spread between species due to their location on transposons.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether intraperitoneal and oral administration of formalin-fixed gram-negative bacteria induced immunohistologically and ultrastructurally evident glomerular deposition of iga and c3 in c3h/hen mice. separate treatments with strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and  two kinds of lipopolysaccharide (lps) were used. two mice in each treatment group were sacrificed at 10, 20 and 30 weeks of age to examine sequential glomerular changes. in addition to the intraperitoneal administration (ip) groups receiving  whole formalin-fixed bacterial cells, cell precipitate and supernatant fractions  of each bacterial strain after sonication were injected intraperitoneally once a  week, and the mice were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. sequential quantitation or igg, iga or igm in serum and the isotypes specific for each of the bacterial strains or lps administered was performed by elisa. the incidence of immunofluorescence positivity for glomerular iga and c3 was 37-71 and 37-66.7%, respectively, in the ip groups that had received bacterial cells of each strain,  which was significantly higher than that in the ip groups given lps or in the controls. these results suggest that cell wall components common among gram-negative bacteria, other than lps, play a major role in the glomerular deposition of iga and c3. this is the first use of gram-negative bacteria to establish an active model of iga nephropathy.

TI  == [clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  == clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. cfpz was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7  for acute uti, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. the effectiveness rate was 96.4%. bacteriologically, 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-streptococcus, 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of salmonella c2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of  streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. the bacteriological eradication rates for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. no side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. as abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of  elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. in conclusion, cfpz was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefetamet against clinically isolated microbial strains collected from urban rti patients].
AB  == the authors studied antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (cfmt) and other leading oral antimicrobials of beta-lactam class against clinically isolated strains from urban respiratory tract infection (rti) patients from january to march, 1992. 1. cfmt showed potent antimicrobial activities against "3 primary pathogens" of rtis i.e., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, but the drug had a slightly higher mic than those of a few oxime-type cephems already on the market. 2. cfmt was as stable as cefixime to beta-lactamase, generated by moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, which reduces the antimicrobial activity of cephems. 3. blood concentrations of cfmt after administering cefetamet pivoxil (cfmt-pi), an oral form of the drug, exceeded the mic80 against the "3 primary pathogens" as well as m. (b) catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. this suggests that cfmt could remain above the mics for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. it is concluded that cfmt-pi will be useful for treating urban rtis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == the prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary  health-monitoring project (koster health project) on the koster islands, sweden.  upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. denture stomatitis type i was identified as sialadenitis. the more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types ii and iii) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. hemophilus spp. and bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types ii and iii. shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be  an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. it is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == a double-blind study of two dosage regimens of lomefloxacin in bacteriologically  proven exacerbations of chronic bronchitis of gram-negative etiology.
AB  == lomefloxacin has been shown to produce high and sustained concentrations in serum and bronchial mucosa after once-daily administration. this study was designed to  assess whether a dose response exists for 400 mg lomefloxacin given once daily or twice daily for 10 days in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis of gram-negative etiology. a total of 100 adult patients with  acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were enrolled at 10 study sites in germany. patients with confirmed bacterial pathogens in the baseline sputum culture (once-daily group n = 49, twice-daily group n = 47) were eligible for analysis of bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. the eradication rates for the most frequently isolated baseline pathogens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were at least 75% for both treatment regimens. overall, once-daily treatment eradicated baseline pathogens in 42 of 49 (85.7%) patients, while twice-daily treatment eradicated pathogens in 43 of 47 (91.5%). this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.226). clinically, 47 of 49 (95.9%) patients in the once-daily group and 46 of 47 (97.9%) in the twice-daily group were cured or improved (p = 0.307). both regimens were well tolerated; there were no differences in the incidence (six patients in each group), types, or severity of adverse events, nor was there clinical evidence of theophylline interaction. the results of this study demonstrate that once-daily treatment with 400 mg lomefloxacin is as effective as twice-daily dosing with 400 mg in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of  chronic bronchitis.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

AB  == we made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. the mean age of those treated was 56.2 years;  73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. there were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. haemophilus influenzae was the most  common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and staphylococcus aureus (10). clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). after 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, streptococcus salivarius  was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of serratia marcescens. we included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to mycoplasma pneumonia and one to legionella pneumophila. ofloxacin was well tolerated. our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == review of effectiveness of cefodizime in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections with parenchymal involvement.
AB  == the efficacy of cefodizime (cdz) in lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) with parenchymal involvement was assessed by the analysis of data from 919 patients who participated in four controlled, randomized studies and three open studies. sputum bacteriology and a chest x-ray were performed at baseline and after therapy. a total of 778 patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 451 for bacteriological efficacy. the most frequent pathogen was streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. cdz 1 g b.i.d., 2 g b.i.d. and 2 g once daily achieved clinical and bacteriological cure rates above 90%, which matched those observed with the comparators (cefuroxime 1.5 g t.i.d. and cefotaxime 2 g b.i.d.). no significant differences in clinical and bacteriological outcome were detected when the various cdz dosage regimens were compared. 1 g cdz b.i.d. is therefore recommended as the regimen of choice for the treatment of lrti with parenchymal involvement, with cdz 2 g once daily as an alternative.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  == effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abe)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. the pathologic and  physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with  abe, although these symptoms are not unique to abe. while culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. bacteria in numbers significantly  above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. bacterial species observed with abe include haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of klebsiella and pseudomonas species. one or more elements of background therapy for abe should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for abe. quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.

TI  == clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  == in a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (ciep). twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. the lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and ciep. ciep was done to detect the bacterial antigens of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. altogether,  a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). in 10 babies, strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. eleven babies (25%) grew gram negative bacteria. the common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were strep. pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinatobacter lowfii, staph. aureus, pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. all the gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. all staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.

TI  == long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (bm) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. the search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. in this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of bm was done in two hospitals in mali and niger, between march, 1989, and may, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48  h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). the cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the  chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). no outbreak occurred during the study period. the hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. the case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133)  for haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for streptococcus pneumoniae. in a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference  between treatment groups. our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for bm in high-incidence countries.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

TI  == cefaclor in the treatment of infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers.
AB  == there is a direct correlation between number of cigarettes smoked and the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in humans. in studies with smokers suffering from exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the most common bacterial pathogens found were haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and branhamella catarrhalis. antibiotics should be effective against such possible pathogens. cefaclor has demonstrated in vitro activity against all these pathogens. we designed the present study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers. a total of 106 patients were enrolled in the study. h. influenzae was the most common bacterial species isolated in the sputum (in 23.6% of the total sample), followed by s. pneumoniae (18.9%), s. aureus (17.0%), k. pneumoniae (7.5%) and b. catarrhalis (5.7%), while mixed forms were present in 22.6% of cases and other pathogens in 4.7%. cefaclor (500 mg) was given orally every 8h for 7 to 16 days (mean 10.73 +/- 2.11). analysis of clinical response data indicates that 75.5% of patients were cured and 17.0% improved. this finding is important because it demonstrates that cefaclor's spectrum of activity encompasses all the most likely pathogens encountered in smokers. because of its excellent response rate, cefaclor is of particular value  in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in cigarette smokers.

AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == in vitro studies with bay v 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activities of bay v 3522, cefaclor, cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate (2:1) and reference penicillins were compared against 314 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and nine strains of escherichia coli that differed in their outer membrane proteins in agar dilution tests with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot. the beta-lactamase stabilities of the cephalosporins were also evaluated by spectrophotometric assay using 21 different beta-lactamases. bay v 3522 was the most potent cephalosporin  overall against gram-positive pathogens, but slightly less active than amoxicillin/clavulanate. in addition to being highly active against streptococci  (mic90 = 0.25 micrograms/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml), bay v 3522 was markedly more active than the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 = 4 micrograms/ml). bay v 3522 was less potent against gram-negative pathogens, especially nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 greater than 64 micrograms/ml), but was active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and beta-lactamase-negative neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml0. hydrolysis of bay v 3522 by most beta-lactamases examined was significantly less than that observed for cephalothin and cefaclor;  similar to that observed with cephalexin; and less than that observed with cefixime and cefuroxime. none of the beta-lactamases examined hydrolysed bay v 3522 at a rate greater than 20 nmol/min/mg. the in vitro potency of bay v 3522 against gram-positive and fastidious gram-negative pathogens and its resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases produced by them support further investigation of this cephalosporin as a new oral therapeutic agent.

AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (ru 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (ru 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. ru 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with mic50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (providencia  sp) to 5 mg/l (c. freundii). ru 51746 was also active against h. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (mic50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-s s. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and s. pneumoniae (0.002). oxa-r staphylococci and p. aeruginosa were resistant to ru 51746 (mic50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). the antibacterial activity of ru 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. the molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type ic). ru 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with enterobacter p99 (type ia). a good correlation was found between in vivo activity of ru 51807 and in vitro activity of ru 51746. cefpodoxime proxetil was found to  be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a dp50 ratio in the 10-100 range. this advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. in contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. in mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in k. pneumoniae lung counts. six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.

TI  == [synergy between sulbactam and ampicillin or cefoperazone in antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase producing microorganisms. results with the use of microdilution broth method].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sulbactam (sbt) with ampicillin (abpc) or with cefoperazone (cpz), in other words, the effects of sbt, an beta-lactamase inhibitor, against beta-lactamase producing strains of clinical isolates, were studied using microdilution broth method. 1. beta-lactamase producing strains such as staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decompose benzylpenicillin (pcg) which is one of substrates of the acid-metry disc method and show a strong reaction, while they do not decompose cefazolin (cez), another substrate, showing no or weak reaction. thus, it is suspected that beta-lactamases produced by these organisms are mainly penicillinase (pcase). mic-distributions of abpc and cpz against these clinical isolates which seemed to produce pcase shifted to lower mic ranges with mic's reduced to 1/4 or below when 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml of  sbt was added. 2. it appears that beta-lactamase produced by proteus vulgaris may be oxyiminocephalosporinase (cxase), because p. vulgaris showed strong reaction on cez, but moderate reaction on pcg in the acid-metry disc method. mic-distribution of abpc and cpz against p. vulgaris shifted to a lower range with mic's of 1/4 or below when 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of sbt was added. 3. all the test strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed strong reaction on cez but  only 56% of the test strains showed reaction on pcg. it appears that the beta-lactamases which showed strong reaction on cez is cephalosporinase and is encoded in chromosome, while those beta-lactamase that showed strong reaction on  pcg is encoded in a plasmid which was acquired secondarily by p. aeruginosa. mic-distribution of cpz against p. aeruginosa shifted to a lower range with mic values of 1/2 or below with the addition of sbt at 1.56 micrograms/ml. 4. it appears that the synergy of sbt with abpc or with cpz against the pcase or cxase  producing strains may occur in the presence of sbt at a concentration far less than that reported previously.

TI  == serious pediatric infections.
AB  == third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. they are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. strains of haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. however, listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone  are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. in many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  == ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable  activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the mics of such pathogens. these in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  (cb). overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for b. catarrhalis to 88.5% for h. influenzae. in lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. eradication rates proved greatest for h. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in b. catarrhalis and 94% in h. influenzae infections. ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline  clinically. a daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. the available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis are involved.

TI  == relationship of high tissue concentrations of azithromycin to bactericidal activity and efficacy in vivo.
AB  == measurement of killing kinetics of azithromycin against strains of streptococcus  pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro showed that it had a limited bactericidal activity (greater than 90% kill) for the first eight hours of incubation, but developed complete bactericidal activity (greater than 99.9% kill) by 24 h incubation. since high and sustained tissue levels of azithromycin  occur in animals and humans, it was proposed that it might produce a bactericidal effect in vivo. this was demonstrated in a lung infection model in mice, designed to mimic the in-vitro killing studies. a 25 mg/kg dose of azithromycin given 24 h before intranasal challenge reduced the recoverable str. pneumoniae population by greater than 99.9%, in comparison with untreated controls. erythromycin did not produce a bactericidal effect at 100 mg/kg, and roxithromycin only reduced the viable count by 96%, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. against a k. pneumoniae lung infection, a 50 mg/kg dose of azithromycin reduced the bacterial count by 99%. the bactericidal effect was correlated with lung tissue concentrations of azithromycin. in a proliferating escherichia coli paper disc infection model, extravascular fluid concentrations of azithromycin were correlated with a 99.9% reduction in bacterial count, while corresponding serum concentrations were always less than the mic. dosing with azithromycin eradicated haemophilus influenzae from the bulla (middle ear) of gerbils, as was not the case with erythromycin and roxithromycin. this effect was correlated with the antibiotic concentration in bulla lavage.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  == since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562  patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa  (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but  s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the  patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed  by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of kt3777, a new orally active carbacephem.
AB  == kt3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (ccl), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. kt3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ccl, cephalexin (cex) and amoxicillin. the mic50 of kt3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. kt3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of ccl. however, against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, kt3777 was about twice as active as ccl. kt3777 was more active than cex against all strains tested. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of kt3777 at concentrations above the mic. kt3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1a, 1bs, 3 and 4 of e. coli nihj jc-2. the protective effect of kt3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of ccl with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of cex. kt3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  == enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to  various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production  type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella  catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of  respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all  age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  == clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides species. in order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp.) were tested. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the  associated culture as a whole. in the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the mbcs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to mbcs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in  single strain testing.

'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

TI  == penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. we conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. for the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for p. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.

TI  == [materno-fetal infections caused by unusual germs. apropos of 9 cases].
AB  == a retrospective study carried out from january 1981 through august 1988 identified nine cases of materno-fetal infections (staphylococcus aureus, 1 case; klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 cases; enterococcus, 3 cases; hemophilus influenzae, 1 case; and pneumococcus, 1 case) in six girls and three boys; four premature infants developed respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. in four  cases, maternal history found risk factors for infection. all patients developed  circulatory failure and one had purulent meningitis. diagnosis was confirmed upon recovery of the microorganism from a central sample in six cases; in three cases, only the peripheral cultures were positive but diagnosis was supported by the positive maternal history and by clinical findings. bacterial species were not associated with specific clinical or biological features, but infections due to hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pneumococcus were particularly severe (two deaths and two infants with neurologic sequelae). in some studies, unusual microorganisms account for 46% of septicemias and 36% of purulent meningitis. group d streptococci are the most common bacteria in this category and may account for 10% to 15% of early neonatal septicemias. organism-specific features are analyzed on the basis of data from the literature. concerning therapy, this epidemiologic aspect of materno-fetal infections complicates the choice of the initial antimicrobial agents; because third-generation cephalosporins are not effective on listeria and group d streptococci, we advocate more widespread use of the ureidopenicillins instead of ampicillin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  == standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of igg (greater than 95%). we have compared the ability of a standard preparation (sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (pentaglobin, containing 12% igm and 12% iga) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in  vitro. panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized staphylococcus aureus almost normally. both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. the major difference between the  two preparations was the ability of pentaglobin to supply opsonins for p. aeruginosa, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for haemophilus influenzae. pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and p. aeruginosa. its content of igm antibodies appears to confer special properties on pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in gram-negative septicaemia.

AB  == in 1987, the most frequently identified pathogens in chronic respiratory tract infections in our clinic were haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae. recurrent infection is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic  bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. h. influenzae is the most common pathogen in such patients. macrolides, tetracyclines and new quinolones were effective to protect against recurrent infection of h. influenzae and these finding suggested  that l-forms of h. influenzae may be significant in the recurrence of infection in patients with chronic respiratory tract infection. bacterial colonization of the oropharynx is the initial event in most lower respiratory tract infections. gargling protects against bacteria colonization of the oropharynx and occurrence  of acute exacerbation.

TI  == role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa. their moderative activity  against streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. the ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages  may afford additional advantage to these agents. they should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. quinolones are very active in experimental models of legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. the potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and  some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.

TI  == immunomodulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by d53 immucytal and its constitutive fractions.
AB  == d53 (immucytal) is a compositive vaccine made of immunogenic ribosomes extracted  from 4 bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae) associated with a membrane proteoglycan from a non-encapsulated strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (mpg-kp). in this work we have studied the effect of the compound on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function "in vitro". we have demonstrated that d53 was able to significantly increase fc- receptor dependent phagocytosis without modify the c3-receptor dependent activity. furthermore d53 enhanced the oxidative metabolism (evaluated by chemiluminescence) both using cells in resting conditions or after  stimulation with phagocytable or soluble stimuli. on the contrary d53 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of pmn migration toward different chemoattractants. using the two constitutive fractions of the compound (ribosomes and proteoglycans) we have observed that the mpg-kp component was mainly responsible  for the modulating activity of the drug on human pmns.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == sultamicillin (sbtpc) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (abpc) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sbt) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. sbtpc is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide abpc and sbt for systemic circulation. in the present study, the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against 50 isolates each of 6 species (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (pcg) of cefazolin (cez) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: s. aureus 86%; k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; b. catarrhalis 68%; h. influenzae 24%. fourteen per cent of s. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both pcg and cez acidometry discs. sbtpc, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (pcase). average mic80 values of sbtpc were 3.13 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and  k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for s. pyogenes. as sbtpc was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against pcase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of sbtpc compared  to abpc alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by sbt which, as noted above, is a component of sbtpc in an equimolar ratio to abpc.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., shigella spp., aeromonas spp., yersinia spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against proteus spp., providencia spp., serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., and shigella spp. ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. lomefloxacin inhibited staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but mics for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml.  in the presence of 9 mm mg2+, mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. a single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the mic occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced mic increases. lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.

TI  == [kinetics of ofloxacin-amoxicillin and ofloxacin-clavulanic acid combinations against pathogenic bacteria of the respiratory tract].
AB  == ofloxacin exhibit a good activity against the pathogen bacteria of the respiratory tract, except for s. pneumoniae. its use is interesting because it has a good diffusion into respiratory tissues. however, the combination with an another antibiotic was necessary to spread the activity spectrum and to prevent the resistant variants. by the new killing curve checkerboard method, these 2 combinations are studied against 8 strains: 4 h. influenzae (2 beta-lactamase producers), 2 s. pneumoniae and 2 k. pneumoniae, at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours, a viable bacteria counting is executed by a microdilution method and is subcultured with a steers-type multiple inoculator. with k. pneumoniae, ofloxacin has a dose  dependent bactericidal activity which is maximum at 1 mg/l, while augmentin has a time-dependent activity. in the combination the synergy is rare. with h. influenzae, the results are the same; the bactericidal activity is less rapid but it is better than the ones with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. with s. pneumoniae, the 2 antibiotics have the same activity. no antagonism is observed.  and the antibiotic which has a better bactericidal activity determine the viable  bacteria count.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  == enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. the mbcs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the mics, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. no single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. in systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against  one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia rettgeri and ps. aeruginosa, and two staphylococcus aureus strains. single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  == collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (rti)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in japan. on this occasion, the data obtained  between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were  isolated. the results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. among staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among s. aureus and also mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa. 2. susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in s. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. the isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of s. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. the antibiotic potency of minocycline against s. aureus, including methicillin resistant s. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; s. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. mucoid producing strains of p. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. when drug susceptibilities of h. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using mic50, mic80 and mic90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. the isolation frequency of ampicillin (abpc)-resistant strains, however, was clearly  different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. in  addition, the drug susceptibility of h. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed  in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. as a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of abpc-resistance. 6. these results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of rti should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according  to diseases.

TI  == induction of murine b cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis by some bacterial ribosomes.
AB  == ribosomal preparations from klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated with respect to their activating capacity towards murine lymphoid cells. the proliferation of balb/c spleen cells was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) by ribosomes of k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes with a peak activity at 48 or 72 hr of culture. the majority of the blast cells induced by these ribosomal preparations were positive for surface-immunoglobulin (s-ig) and negative for thy 1.2. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. pyogenes ribosomes induced the synthesis of igm and some iga. cell proliferation and induction of igm production were also demonstrated with the 3 ribosomal preparations using spleen cells from athymic nude (nu+/nu+) mice, lyb-5-defective cba/n spleen cells, b cell-enriched and t cell-depleted balb/c spleen cell suspensions, as well as spleen cells from the ips gene-deficient c3h/hej strain. cell culture supernatants contained specific anti-ribosome igm antibodies. antibodies of other specificities (anti-sheep erythrocytes) were also demonstrated in supernatants from k. pneumoniae-stimulated cultures. evidence against a possible role of contamination of k. pneumoniae and h. influenzae ribosomes by lipopolysaccharide- or lipid a-associated proteins in this effect is discussed. ribosomes from s. pneumoniae did not induce 3h-thymidine incorporation nor ig production. none of the 4 ribosomal preparations was found to stimulate t cell blastogenesis or to induce interleukin-2 production by naive balb/c spleen cells. finally, ribosomes from h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae but not those of k. pneumoniae stimulated  interleukin-1 production by adherent spleen cells, from balb/c mice.

TI  == comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all  isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and  cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
AB  == pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. a variety of conditions that damage the airways and weaken host defense mechanisms increase the susceptibility of the individual to bacterial colonization of the pulmonary tree. because the clinician frequently cannot determine the etiologic agent, pneumonia is often treated empirically. cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin, is a useful and cost-effective antibiotic that is active against many of the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. it is also active against less common community-acquired pathogens, such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and some anaerobic mouth flora. erythromycin is useful when mycoplasma or legionella species are suspected. cefonicid's demonstrated safety and efficacy, its low cost, and its long half-life, permitting once-daily dosing, make this antibiotic an ideal parenteral choice for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == inhibition of human neutrophil elastase by bacterial polyanions.
AB  == we previously demonstrated that pneumococcal extracts contain a highly specific inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (hne). we now show that the active inhibitor in these extracts is a high-molecular-weight, heat-stable substance that appears to be rna, since inhibitory activity of pneumococcal extracts is decreased by incubation with ribonuclease but not by incubation with deoxyribonuclease or proteinase k. moreover, metabolically labeled ([3h]uridine)  pneumococcal rna, isolated by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, strongly inhibits hne. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, although polyanionic, is only weakly inhibitory toward hne and is not a major source of elastase-inhibitory activity in pneumococcal extracts. on the other hand, the capsule of haemophilus influenzae type b contains polyribosylribitol phosphate. this highly charged polyanion possesses hne-inhibitory activity, but only under special circumstances to be discussed below. pneumococci (type i, type ii smooth, type ii rough) and h. influenzae (type b) all release hne-inhibitory activity into their culture medium during growth. by contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus release little (if any) stable hne-inhibitory activity during growth. we propose that some bacterial pneumonias  may spare host tissue because polyanions released by the invading microorganisms  (e.g. rna from autolysing pneumococci) inhibit elastase released from inflammatory neutrophils and thereby modulate accompanying tissue proteolysis. pneumonias caused by microorganisms that do not release stable polyanionic inhibitors of hne (e.g., staphylococcus and klebsiella) may be correspondingly more injurious to the lung.

TI  == bacterial capsular polysaccharides--biochemistry, immunity and vaccine.
AB  == the biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (pss) has been extensively studied. antibody responses to ps antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. at present, three bacterial ps vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and h. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the u.s.a. many other pss, such as group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from asian populations  showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in asia than that observed in the u.s.a.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in taiwan, 72.9% in japan and 87.9-92.8% in the u.s.a. a large number of pneumococcal types found in taiwan and japan, such as 15a, 23a, 24f and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. immunization with one type of group 9 or 19f ps induced a poor antibody response to the other type. all 9n, 9v, 19f and 19a pss are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal pss and pss from other bacteria. klebsiella k2 ps could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19f ps. the structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19f ps. a difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified pss. antibodies against the pss can be elicited when ps antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. in  mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal ps during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  == it has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. the range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase,  because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout japan between september of 1985 and march of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. mic's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid p. aeruginosa, 29 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of escherichia coli and for 42 strains of branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. as for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. these chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (dpb), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though dpb was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis  was 5.5%, that of dpb was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all  the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. this reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. as with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and dpb. h. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by  about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. p. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == pneumonias acquired from others. 1. history, examination, laboratory findings.
AB  == differential diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia can be elusive, even though the disease remains a frequent cause of admission to the hospital. the familiar organisms--pneumococci, group a streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and hemophilus influenzae--are still often the cause. however, less common organisms, in particular pneumocystis carinii, which is associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, are being seen more often. data gathered from a thorough history, physical examination, laboratory testing,  and sputum evaluation must be considered as a body of evidence, and a pattern often emerges that suggests a particular clinical picture.

AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

TI  == activity of sulbactam/ampicillin in screening and discriminative animal models of infection.
AB  == the efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of mice with fatal systemic infections produced by ampicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or proteus vulgaris strains is well established. in this paper the demonstrations of efficacy for sulbactam/ampicillin have been extended to a number of clinically relevant models, including bacteremia and meningitis produced by h. influenzae in infant rats, experimental staphylococcal endocarditis in rabbits, localized lesions in mice, urinary tract infections in rats, and prophylaxis in a surgical wound model in mice. in these models, in which ampicillin-resistant organisms were used, sulbactam/ampicillin was either more effective than or as effective as appropriate control agents. neither sulbactam nor ampicillin used separately displayed significant activity. the results of supportive pharmacokinetic studies, in which differential bioassays were used, demonstrated that sulbactam and ampicillin generally were delivered with equal efficiency to plasma and to extravascular fluids obtained by sampling the contents of implanted cylinders.

TI  == once daily ceftriaxone for central nervous system infections and other serious pediatric infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone has a very long serum half-life and enhanced in vitro activity against common pediatric pathogens. therefore we evaluated the efficacy and safety of once daily ceftriaxone therapy in 57 children with serious infections including: meningitis (26 patients); ventriculitis (3); pyelonephritis (7); osteomyelitis (6); abscess (4); septic arthritis (3); sepsis (2); and miscellaneous infections (6). the most common isolates were haemophilus influenzae (23), escherichia coli (9) and staphylococcus aureus (8). ceftriaxone  was given intravenously or intramuscularly in a dose of 50 mg/kg for non-central  nervous system (cns) infections. patients with cns infections received an initial dose of 100 mg/kg followed by 80 mg/kg 12 hours later and once daily thereafter.  in a limited number of patients no major differences in serum ceftriaxone concentrations were found after intravenous or intramuscular injection. of 57 patients with pathogens isolated 55 were completely cured; in one patient with klebsiella pneumoniae ventriculitis, intraventricular gentamicin was briefly added to the regimen. another patient with an anaerobic liver abscess recovered after metronidazole was administered. in three patients a delayed response to ceftriaxone was noted. one patient with previous recurrent infections had a second episode of h. influenzae meningitis 22 days after cessation of therapy. clinical side effects were noted in 10 of 71 patients (including 14 treated patients who had negative cultures). seven patients had diarrhea, one each had fever or rash and one had fever, rash and arthralgia. laboratory side effects in  16 of 71 patients included eosinophilia (7), thrombocytosis (7), elevated liver enzymes (4) and leukopenia and neutropenia (2).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == [basic and clinical studies on cefotaxime].
AB  == the most frequently encountered infectious disease in the field of internal medicine is respiratory tract infections. one of the most important requirements  for an antibiotic in the treatment of infections is that it must be efficiently transferred to the infected site to attain a high concentration there. in the case of respiratory tract infections, it is desirable for the drug concentration  in the sputum to be higher than the mic for the causative bacterium. cefotaxime (ctx) expresses potent antibacterial activity against haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae, which are the major causative bacteria of respiratory tract infections. ctx also exerts antibacterial effects against a wide range of other bacteria. we administered ctx to patients with respiratory tract infections, then measured and compared the drug concentrations  in the serum and sputum. the results are described below. when 2 g of ctx was drip-infused, the drug concentration in the serum was 113.0 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after the completion of infusion, 64.9 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 38.7  micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 19.0 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 8.9 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 3.8 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. the drug concentration in the sputum was  1.29 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after completion of infusion, 1.54 micrograms/ml  at 5 to 30 minutes, 1.36 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1.47 micrograms/ml at 1 to 2 hours, 1.12 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.35 micrograms/ml at 4 to 6 hours. the drug concentration in the serum was the highest at 5 minutes after completion of the drip-infusion, and then it gradually decreased.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antigen detection in the diagnosis and in the prognostic assessment of bacterial  pneumonias.
AB  == sputum cultures are not helpful in the immediate management of patients with bacterial pneumonia. sputum gram stains may provide a presumptive identification  of an etiologic agent; this procedure, however, is insensitive (approximately 50%). consequently, during the last decade, other more sensitive and specific methods of providing a rapid etiologic diagnosis have been sought. this article discusses data on antigen detection in various body fluids by counterimmunoelectrophoresis and agglutination tests. results from our own laboratory as well as those reported in the literature are presented. the best estimates of antigen detection rates, by the most sensitive assays, in pneumococcal pneumonia, are as follows: serum, 45%-80%; urine, 50%-64%; and sputum, 75%-100%. there is less information for haemophilus, klebsiella, and pseudomonas pneumonias, but the diagnostic yield is approximately 50%-100%. data  will also be presented on the association between free and complexed antigens and morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal pneumonia. indicators of morbidity discussed include disseminated intravascular coagulation, duration and severity of illness, and occurrence of nephritis.

TI  == [infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  == central nervous system (cns) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. cns infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. the organism causing cns infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. the common causes of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. meningitis  in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common  and is followed by e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter and proteus. a major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis. meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. fungi are among the most common organisms involving the cns in immunocompromised hosts. susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts. the primary site of infection is the lung.  spread to the cns is via the blood stream. the clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. candida causes  meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. organisms reach the cns via the blood stream usually from the  digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. the primary infection is in the lung. the parasites that infest the cns of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a t-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. the most common are toxoplasma gondii and strongyloides stercoralis. there have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. toxoplasma  gondii causes major cns disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  == bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. possible causative pathogens  mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from september 1983 to march 1984, were collected. the frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on h. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. the kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. h. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by p. aeruginosa (24.1%), s. aureus (8.2%), s. pneumoniae (7.3%) and k. pneumoniae (5.9%) and e. coli (4.1%) in 1981; p. aeruginosa (30.4%), s. pneumoniae (11.9%),  s. aureus (4.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.0%) and e. coli (1.8%) in 1982; p. aeruginosa  (26.7%), s. pneumoniae (10.1%), s. aureus (7.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.5%) and e. coli (3.5%) in 1983. the drug susceptibility test of h. influenzae to ampicillin  (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), mezlocillin (mzpc), sulbenicillin (sbpc), gentamicin (gm), amikacin (amk), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz), cefoperazone (cpz), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and latamoxef (lmox) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. h. influenzae was most markedly  susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to cmx, czx and ctx by which about 95% of h. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of h. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. the frequency of s. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. however, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. the frequency of isolation of s. pneumoniae decreased every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cefotiam therapy of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == cefotiam, a new cephalosporin, was evaluated in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 29 patients. the bacteria isolated from the sputum of these patients included streptococcus pneumoniae (31%), klebsiella pneumoniae (31%), and haemophilus influenzae (28%). satisfactory response was observed in 90% of the patients. there were three treatment failures, two superinfections, and four colonizations with gram-negative organisms resistant to the drug. superficial phlebitis was noted in two patients. the results of this study suggest that cefotiam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to susceptible organisms.

TI  == comparison of ceftriaxone and ampicillin plus chloramphenicol for the therapy of  acute bacterial meningitis.
AB  == ceftriaxone, a new third-generation cephalosporin, appears to be promising for the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis. the 90% mbcs of ceftriaxone against 54 recent cerebrospinal fluid isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25  micrograms/ml. we examined the efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis in bahia, brazil. the study was conducted in two phases; in phase a, ceftriaxone was coadministered with ampicillin. the mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ceftriaxone 24 h after an intravenous dose of 80 mg/kg were 4.2 and 2.3 micrograms/ml on days 4 to 6 and 10 to 12 of therapy, respectively. these concentrations were 8- to more than 100-fold greater than the 90% mbcs against the relevant pathogens. in phase b, ceftriaxone (administered once daily at a dose of 80 mg/kg after an initial dose of 100 mg/kg) was compared with conventional dosages of ampicillin and chloramphenicol in a prospective randomized trial of 36 children and adults with meningitis. the groups were comparable based on clinical, laboratory, and etiological parameters. ceftriaxone given once daily produced results equivalent to those obtained with ampicillin plus chloramphenicol, as judged by cure rate, case fatality ratio, resolution with sequelae, type and severity of sequelae, time to sterility of cerebrospinal  fluid, and potentially drug-related adverse effects. the cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal titers obtained 16 to 24 h after ceftriaxone dosing were usually 1:512 to greater than 1:2,048 even late in the treatment course, compared with values of 1:8 to 1:32 in patients receiving ampicillin plus chloramphenicol. ceftriaxone clearly deserves further evaluation for the therapy of meningitis; the optimal dose, dosing frequency (every 12 h or every 24 h), and duration of therapy remain to be determined.

TI  == [immunostimulating activity of combined antigens of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus, proteus and escherichia coli and separate components in cross infection].
AB  == experiments on mice have revealed that the combined preparation of k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus, proteus and e. coli antigens possesses pronounced immunostimulating activity against the microorganisms whose antigens make up this combined preparation, as well as against haemophilus influenzae, type b. cross protection between the antigens making up the preparation was observed, as well as of each of its components with respect to h. influenzae, type b. the activity  of the combined antigenic preparation has been shown to exceed that of its monocomponents, as manifested under the conditions of cross infection. these experimental data may serve as a prerequisite for the development of an immunostimulant for the treatment of patients with chronic pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  == the worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of november 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the united states, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. principal pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella species, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. a total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of p. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of p. aeruginosa. higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. imipenem/cilastatin compares well with  the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid c-reactive protein in the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 112 cases of suspected meningitis were tested for the presence of c-reactive protein (crp), using a qualitative and quantitative slide test. bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 34 patients, based on csf and blood culture results, and/or elevated csf white blood cell (wbc) count and typical biochemical profile. there were 8 patients with early onset, and 3 who had received prior antimicrobial therapy among the 5 neonates, 23 children, and 6 adults with bacterial meningitis. organisms recovered from csf, and/or blood, included haemophilus influenzae 14, streptococcus pneumoniae 9, streptococcus group b-5, staphylococcus aureus 2, e. coli 2 and klebsiella pneumoniae 1. slide test was positive for crp in 33 cases, giving a sensitivity of 97% which compared favourably with elevated csf protein 33%, decreased cfs glucose 64.7% csf glucose/blood glucose less than 1/2, 85%, raised csf wbc 38.2%, raised csf pmn 61.7%, csf culture positive 88.2%, and csf gram-positive 82.5%. slide test was positive for crp in 1 of 78 csf samples negative for bacterial meningitis, giving a specificity of 98%. it was concluded that testing of csf for crp is a simple, rapid and accurate method for the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, which is particularly appropriate for areas lacking adequate laboratory facilities.

TI  == treatment of pneumonia with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  == this pilot study assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerance of intravenously administered imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of adults hospitalised with community acquired pneumonia. thirteen patients were treated with 500 mg imipenem and 500 mg cilastatin eight hourly for a minimum of five days. eleven patients (85%) had a clinical cure; (legionella pneumophila was the pathogen in four, streptococcus pneumoniae in one, branhamella catarrhalis in one, no pathogen identified in five). one patient had a partial response (staphylococcus aureus);  and one patient was a treatment failure (haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella ozaenae). clinical and laboratory side effects were mild, reversible and did not  require treatment to be stopped. we conclude that the combination of imipenem and cilastatin was effective as a single agent in the treatment of the majority of these patients with hospital referred community acquired pneumonia.

TI  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in children with chronic liver disease: clinical features and etiologic factors.
AB  == we analyzed the clinical and bacteriologic features of 12 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) in 11 children (four boys, median age 5.5 years) with chronic liver disease. all patients had cirrhosis and ascites; four had hypersplenism, and one was asplenic. symptoms included increasing abdominal distention, pyrexia, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, and encephalopathy. nine had rebound tenderness on abdominal palpation, and 12 had reduced bowel sounds. the most frequent organisms isolated from culture of ascitic fluid were streptococcus pneumoniae (nine). klebsiella (two), and haemophilus influenzae (one); blood cultures grew identical organisms in nine. seven patients died despite intensive antibiotic therapy. in the 3 months prior to onset of sbp, defective yeast opsonization and reduced serum concentration of  c4 were found in all nine children tested; eight had reduced concentration of c3. functional deficiency of all complement components was present in four tested within 1 to 5 months of the onset. in contrast, only eight of 59 cirrhotic children without sbp had low c3, and eight had defective yeast opsonization, although 35 had low c4 values. four of the patients with sbp and low c3 and c4 concentrations had normal concentrations at the time of diagnosis of liver disease 2 to 5 years previously. opsonization of type iii pneumococci was reduced in sera from three patients who subsequently developed pneumococcal peritonitis.  the incidence of sbp in children with chronic liver disease is similar to that in adults, as are the clinical features. our observations suggest that complement deficiency induced by chronic liver disease may be important in the pathogenesis  of sbp.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk  diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis  for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.

TI  == clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. the group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years,  43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus in six, staphylococcus epidermidis in five and streptococcus faecalis in two. klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by enterobacter (n = 6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), escherichia coli  (n = 3), serratia marcescens and citrobacter (two cases each). the in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of  pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. there was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and t cell functions in pha stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. a combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.

TI  == detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  == the production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. the genera were: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, rare enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. the data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. the nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == position of ceftazidime in respiratory diseases.
AB  == twenty patients (10 males and 10 females), ranging in age from 53 to 81 years, were treated with ceftazidime, 2-3 g/day i.m., for 12 to 15 days. all patients were suffering from moderate to severe infections of the lower respiratory tract  (6 cases of pneumonia and 14 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis).  in addition, almost all patients presented severe local and general predisposing  factors (three patients with lung cancer, two with bronchiectasis and 14 with respiratory insufficiency). the aetiological agents responsible for the infections were mainly gram-negative bacteria (6 klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 haemophilus influenzae, 4 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 proteus strains). the clinical and microbiological results of the treatment were good. with the exception of one case of maculopapular rash, none of the patients complained of adverse reactions and no toxic effects were observed.

TI  == [criteria and methods of etiological diagnosis of acute and chronic inflammatory  processes in the lungs].
AB  == the clinical, bacteriological, cytological, serological and allergological data were analyzed in 376 patients with acute pneumonia and chronic bronchitis to study the diagnostic importance of the microorganisms isolated from the sputum. the informativeness of the methods was estimated by correlation of the appropriate data with the data of the final verified diagnosis of the inflammatory process in the lungs. bacterioscopy of the sputum smear stained according to gram, bioassay on mice, determination of bacterial concentration per ml sputum, allergic tests with bacterial allergens were found to be the most reliable methods as regards the etiological diagnosis of acute pneumonias. it should be mentioned that bacterioscopy is an early criterion of the disease etiology. criteria of the etiological significance of bacteria which cause exacerbation of chronic bronchitis encompass the measurement of bacterial concentration per ml sputum, indirect immunofluorescence with autostrains of the  isolated bacteria and the bioassay. early criteria include the first two methods.

TI  == [lack of specificity of protected distal bronchial samples in the bacteriological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram negative bacilli].
AB  == lower respiratory tract secretions (lrs) were sampled during a two year period in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation using a method previously described by matthew et al. only those lrs positive for gram-negative bacilli were reported in this study. the patients were separated in two groups: those with nosocomial pneumonia due to gram-negative bacilli (np+ group) and those without (np- group). the species most often isolated from lrs were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), proteus (20%), escherichia coli (18%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7%). the spectrum of gram-negative species was not statistically different in either group of patients. the numbers  of gram-negative bacilli isolated from each lrs were more important in the np+ group (p less than 0.001), but so was the duration of mechanical ventilation before each lrs (p less than 0.01). in this group also, a specific bacteriological diagnosis with only one species was possible in 3 out of the 13 cases; a tentative diagnosis only was possible in 10 cases: in 6 cases, the responsibility of two (or more) species was suggested. the susceptibility to antibiotics of gram-negative bacilli isolated from lrs was moderate. a third generation cephalosporin together with amikacin seemed to be the best choice of antibiotics when no specific bacteriological diagnosis could be made with the lrs.

TI  == in vitro activity of temocillin against gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  == 120 consecutive clinical isolates of various species of enterobacteriaceae and 30 consecutive clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae (including 5 which produced beta-lactamase) were assessed for susceptibility to temocillin using a broth microdilution technique and both 'light' (10(3) cfu/ml) and 'heavy' (10(6)  cfu/ml) inocula. at the lighter inoculum, 90% of the enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by temocillin at a concentration of 4 mg/l. 90% of the h. influenzae were similarly inhibited at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, and no differences were  observed between producers and non-producers of beta-lactamase. at the heavier inoculum, a significant inoculum effect was observed: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) increased up to 128-fold for h. influenzae and somewhat less than that for the enterobacteriaceae. klebsiella pneumoniae was least affected by inoculum, showing only a 2- to 4-fold increase in the mic. it is concluded that temocillin is active in vitro against the species tested and warrants further clinical trial.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == clinicopathologic study of six cases of meningitis and meningoencephalitis in chimpanzees (pan troglodytes).
AB  == three fatal cases of purulent meningitis and one fatal case of thromboembolic necrotizing meningoencephalitis occurred in chimpanzees from the primate center tno, the netherlands. in addition, two apes had clinical signs of meningitis and  were successfully treated. the severity of the residual hemiparesis and dysphagia in one of these two apes was such that it was killed for humane reasons. the histopathological diagnosis was chronic active meningoencephalitis. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from five apes and klebsiella pneumoniae from one. in the majority of cases, the primary site of infection was the upper respiratory tract. after reducing the population density, initiating a vaccination program using a commercially available human polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, and changing the cleaning procedure of the animal facilities, no other cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis have occurred in the chimpanzee colony in the ensuing 3.5 years.

AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == activity of imipenem on aerobic bacteria.
AB  == imipenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is a potent inhibitor of plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem on clinical isolates classified according to their susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. on penicillin g-susceptible bacteria, imipenem is comparable to penicillin. on streptococci, pneumococci, staphylococcus aureus and listeria the mics were 0.02 to 0.06 mg/l.  on gonococci, mics were 0.04 to 0.25 mg/l. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to  beta-lactam antibiotics or naturally resistant to certain of them (e.g. klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin) were highly susceptible to imipenem with mics from 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l. it was slightly less active on haemophilus influenzae, compared to ampicillin. on beta-lactam-resistant bacteria, imipenem maintained a remarkable activity. for penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mic 16 mg/l) the imipenem mic was 1 mg/l. imipenem was equally effective on beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing haemophilus influenzae and gonococci. among 12 nocardia asteroides tested, 11 had mic less than 1 mg/l. when tested at 30 degrees, the mic of imipenem for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ranged from 8 to 64 mg/l in contrast to 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l for oxacillin-sensitive isolates. eighteen strains of enterococci (17 faecium, 2 faecalis) resistant to ampicillin (mic 128 mg/l) were  more resistant to imipenem (mic 16 to 256 mg/l). imipenem was very active on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including multiply-resistant salmonella typhi., with mics in a range from 0.06 to 4 mg/l).(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

AB  == during the period from september 1981 to march 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in japan. of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of escherichia coli were tested in vitro for  minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. the data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the  age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection  of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. in respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. the present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.

AB  == augmentin (beecham laboratories, bristol, tenn.), a combination drug consisting of two parts amoxicillin to one part clavulanic acid and a potent beta-lactamase  inhibitor, was evaluated in vitro in comparison with ampicillin or amoxicillin or both for its inhibitory and bactericidal activities against selected clinical isolates. regression analysis was performed and tentative disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints were determined. a multicenter performance study of the disk diffusion test was conducted with three quality control organisms to determine tentative quality control limits. all methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to augmentin,  although the minimal inhibitory concentrations for beta-lactamase-producing strains of both groups were, on the average, fourfold higher than those for enzyme-negative strains. among the enterobacteriaceae, augmentin exhibited significantly greater activity than did ampicillin against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, proteus vulgaris, and about one-third of the escherichia coli strains tested. bactericidal activity usually occurred at the minimal inhibitory concentration. there was a slight inoculum concentration effect on the augmentin minimal inhibitory concentrations. on the basis of regression and error rate-bounded analyses, the suggested interpretive disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints for augmentin are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 18 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 13 mm (gram-negative bacilli); and susceptible,  greater than or equal to 20 mm (staphylococci and h. influenzae). the use of a beta-lactamase-producing organism, such as e. coli beecham 1532, is recommended for quality assurance of augmentin susceptibility testing.

AB  == during the period from may through july 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftizoxime (czx), cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz) and cefazolin (cez). ctx and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. the clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order:  urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that p. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. this was followed by e. coli and e. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and c. freundii and e. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. in relation to s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, ctx showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was czx. cmz and lmox were found to show relatively high mic values for those species. against s. aureus, cez showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. with regard to gram-negative bacteria, ctx and czx showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for p. aeruginosa. these were followed, in order, by lmox and cpz. compared with these 4 antibiotics, ctm, cmz and cez were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. in relation to p. aeruginosa, the peak of the mic distribution for cpz was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. this was followed by ctx (25 micrograms/ml) lmox (25  micrograms/ml) and czx (50 micrograms/ml). ctm had an mic of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of p. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. all of the strains were resistant to cmz and cez, showing mics of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. for each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the mic and the serogroup for either p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens.

TI  == transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == clinical trial of bacampicillin in acute bacterial infections.
AB  == a clinical trial of bacampicillin was carried out in 20 patients. the antibiotic  was found to be effective in acute lobar pneumonia, pyogenic meningitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, cellulitis, furunculosis, and pyomyositis caused by such ampicillin-sensitive organisms as neisseria meningitidis, diplococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. rash in three patients was the only side effect encountered. it is concluded that while bacampicillin may have overcome some of the disadvantages of ampicillin, it retains its main attributes and some shortcomings.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  == cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for  the treatment of respiratory infections. this bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in  the treatment of respiratory infections. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae 53, haemophilus influenzae 64, klebsiella pneumoniae 43, escherichia coli 9, enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of  60 pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. in vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. in 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. from these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.

TI  == azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin: new broad-spectrum penicillins.
AB  == three new broad-spectrum penicillins--azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin--will soon be available for clinical use. azlocillin and piperacillin are more active than carbenicillin or ticarcillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. piperacillin and mezlocillin demonstrate significant activity against the enterobacteriaceae, including many strains of klebsiella pneumoniae against which the older penicillins carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and ampicillin are ineffective. all three new drugs show substantial activity against anaerobes and ampicillin-susceptible gonococci and haemophilus influenzae. because these agents are inactivated by various beta-lactamases, most staphylococcus aureus isolates and a number of gram-negative organisms, including some important nosocomial pathogens, will be resistant to these antibiotics. the  new penicillins appear to be relatively safe and have been used successfully to treat patients with various infections; however, comparative trials have not yet  established the superiority of these drugs over conventional therapeutic agents.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in the pediatric infections].
AB  == cefmenoxime (cmx) was evaluated in 25 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. of the 20 confirmed bacterial infections, 19 were cured by cmx therapy (effective rate, 95%). the diagnoses included acute pharyngotonsillitis (4), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (7), streptococcal dacryocystitis (1), infections accompanied with acute leukemia (4), and acute urinary tract infections (3). the  etiologic pathogens were beta-hemolytic streptococcus group a (1), and f (1), staphylococcus aureus (4), haemophilus influenzae (4), escherichia coli (4), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), etc. cmx was very effective for 2 children with respiratory infections due to ampicillin resistant h. influenzae type b. the half life of serum concentration of cmx was 0.76 +/- 0.17 hour after an intravenous bolus injection. a cerebrospinal fluid level of cmx was 5.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. however this level was not as high as those of cefotaxime, latamoxef, or ceftizoxime measured in the same case. no severe adverse reaction was encountered with cmx therapy. the data suggest that cmx is a safe and effective parenteral antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of temocillin.
AB  == temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin, inhibited 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and shigella at a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoea were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. changing the medium or ph of the cultures did not alter  the minimal inhibitory concentrations, which were similar in broth and human serum, as were the minimal bactericidal concentrations. an increase in inoculum size from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units increased concentration required for inhibition. temocillin inhibited strains resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin. most pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were resistant, as were gram-positive organisms. temocillin was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and  chromosomal beta-lactamases but inhibited them. the resistance of certain gram-negative bacilli to temocillin seemed to be a result of failure of the molecule to enter through the cell wall, since combination of temocillin with edta made pseudomonas, acinetobacter, and enterobacter strains susceptible to low concentrations of the compound.

TI  == determination of bacterial meningitis: a retrospective study of 80 cerebrospinal  fluid specimens evaluated by four in vitro methods.
AB  == a total of 80 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were analyzed for bacterial meningitis by four procedures readily available to most laboratories. these tests included routine culturing. gram staining, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis,  staphylococcal coagglutination (coa) with laboratory-prepared reagents, and coa with pharmacia diagnostics reagents. a total of 56 specimens were positive for bacterial agents by routine culturing: gram stain results were positive for 64% of all specimens positive by culturing. for 36 specimens from patients with suspected meningitis due to either haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, or group b streptococci, detection was 97% with pharmacia coa reagents, 94% with laboratory-prepared coa reagents, 89% with routine culturing,  78% with countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and 75% with gram staining. one specimen which contained klebsiella pneumoniae was false positive for s. pneumoniae in tests with both of the coa reagents and in countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. a gram stain of this specimen clearly showed gram-negative bacilli, which were confirmed by culturing. although a positive culture and a positive gram stain are definitive evidence of bacterial meningitis, rapid immunological tests can provide valuable clinical information as an adjunct to culture and gram stain results. serological tests with pharmacia coa reagents produced more positive results than either laboratory-prepared coa reagents or countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis.

TI  == treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis: role of the new cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == results of the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis have been disappointing: mortality is extremely high, and treatment with chloramphenicol has shown a high failure rate. this failure rate for chloramphenicol is consistent with the wide gap between minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of this drug for escherichia coli, klebsiella, and other enterobacteriaceae. cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin, is cidal for most gram-negative bacteria at concentrations of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. by late  1981, 137 patients with meningitis due to a variety of bacteria had been treated  with this agent. bacteriologic cure rates were 93% for meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae and  88% for meningitis due to gram-negative bacteria (94.4% for meningitis due to e.  coli and klebsiella). this new antibiotic shows considerable promise in the treatment of these forms of meningitis.

TI  == clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  == the efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. the first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. a total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. in the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. the efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (p = 0.03). favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to proteus, enterobacter, and klebsiella species. cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. all serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for  pseudomonas isolates was wide.

TI  == comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for h. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. cefotaxime was the most active agent against h. influenzae;  it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. it was also the most active agent against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid salmonella species, and yersinia enterocolitica. cefotaxime was among the most active agents against  enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter species, shigella species, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. none of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis. new therapy and changing concepts.
AB  == because the csf is deficient in opsonic and phagocytic activity, optimal therapy  for meningitis mandates the use of antibiotics that are bactericidal at achievable csf concentrations. this therapeutic principles is satisfied for the common meningeal pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis) but is not readily achieved for the pathogens causing gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), such as klebsiella and escherichia coli. the antibiotics used to treat gnbm, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides, are not bactericidal against enteric pathogens at achievable csf levels. two new  beta-lactam antibiotics, moxalactam disodium and cefotaxime sodium, are suitable  agents for the treatment of gnbm. these antibiotics possess potent bactericidal activity against most enteric pathogens and achieve high levels in the csf (15 to 35 micrograms/ml for moxalactam disodium and 2 to 10 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime sodium). recent clinical studies document an 85% cure rate when these agents are  used to treat gnbm.

AB  == the incidence of bacterial, viral, mycoplasma, and rickettsial infections has been assessed prospectively in 210 adult patients with pneumonia who presented to a district hospital over a six-year period. one hundred and thirteen infective agents were detected in 103 patients. the agent most frequently detected was mycoplasma pneumoniae which accounted for 30 infections. a bacterial pathogen was found in 43 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common of these (24 patients); staphylococcus aureus (eight), haemophilus influenzae (four), klebsiella spp (three), and legionella pneumophila (three) were all less common.  chlamydial or rickettsial infections (psittacosis or q fever) were detected in nine patients. viral infections were found in 31 patients (22 influenza a, four influenza b, two parainfluenza, and three respiratory syncytial virus). there were 10 patients in whom more than one pathogen was identified. in 107 patients no pathogens could be identified. seventy-five per cent of these patients had either received antibiotics before entering hospital, or were unable to produce any sputum for culture. the incidence of bacterial pneumonia has probably therefore been underestimated. nevertheless this survey does emphasise the importance of m pneumoniae as a pathogen in patients with pneumonia presenting to hospital.

TI  == in vivo activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic  cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904) was compared with other newer beta-lactam antibiotics for activity in experimental infections of mice with enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacteria. overall, ceftriaxone was equal or superior to cefotaxime and cefoperazone against systemic infections. all three drugs were highly potent against most organisms but were considerably less active against p. aeruginosa. however, ceftriaxone tended to be more active than the other two agents against 8 of the 10 p. aeruginosa strains tested. ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime (sce 1365), and moxalactam were all highly active against systemic infections with 16 strains of enterobacteriaceae, whereas ceftriaxone was more active against infections with two strains of streptococci. when the drugs were administered at various time intervals before infection, ceftriaxone was superior to cefotaxime, cefmenoxime,  and moxalactam. this suggested that ceftriaxone might be eliminated from mice more slowly than the other drugs. in the case of cefotaxime, this was directly confirmed by microbiological assays of plasma samples. in a murine meningitis model induced by klebsiella pneumoniae or streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin or cefotaxime. ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin, cefotaxime, piperacillin, cefamandole, or carbenicillin in a pneumococcal, pneumonia model in mice. these studies indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with unusual pharmacokinetic properties.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

AB  == cefoxitin (cfx) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. fifteen patients were treated with 73-125 mg/kg per day of cfx by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (4), pneumonia (2), pertussis and pneumonia (1), urinary tract infection (3); and the  remaining 5 patients were esteemed to have nonbacterial infections. all the 10 patients of bacterial infections were cured after the cfx therapy. the pathogens  recovered were streptococcus pyogenes (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (3), haemophilus influenzae (2), escherichia coli (2), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1). all the strains isolated were susceptible to cfx, but the 2 isolates of haemophilus influenzae had relatively high mic values (12.5 mcg/ml). diarrhea (3 cases) and transient neutropenia (1 case) were found to be associated with the cfx therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half-life of the serum level was short (24.1  minutes) and excretion into the urine was rapid. csf concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg of cfx in 1 case with inflamed meninges was considerably high (8.3 mcg/ml). cfx appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  == [quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  == a quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%).  streptococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. among gram-negative bacteria, enterobacter, providencia, proteus, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, serratia, herella, pseudomonas, and among the hyphomycetes, candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. finally, interference phenomena in vivo by staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus and diphtheroids were noted.

TI  == [cefotaxime csf levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the c.s.f. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. compared to the m.i.c. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the c.s.f. are much higher than the m.i.c.'s. these results are comparable to those of previous studies. cefotaxime diffuses in the c.s.f. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against  haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  == we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sch 24893, sch 25298, and sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. all of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of shigella  dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant salmonella typhi. the analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of escherichia  coli, seven strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of enterobacter cloacae. fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae were  uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration,  0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. of the three haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. we conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity  against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections with ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904). a pilot study.
AB  == two pilot comparative trials in 29 patients suffering from severe lower respiratory tract infections are described. 15 patients received 7-10.5 g ceftriaxone as a total dose and 14 received 28 g amoxicillin, both antibiotics being given by intravenous route during 1 week. the local and systemic tolerance  of the drugs were satisfactory; no adverse reactions or relevant laboratory changes were noticed. the clinical response was favourable in all patients. the mot relevant pathogens found in the sputum were streptococcus pneumoniae in 11 cases and haemophilus influenzae in 15 cases. less relevant microorganisms such as klebsiella pneumonia, serratia, pseudomonas sp. and streptococcus viridans were cultivated prior to therapy. the two main pathogens disappeared from the sputum after therapy in 11 of 13 patients treated with ceftriaxone and in 10 of 13 treated with amoxicillin. the results of these pilot studies indicate that 7-10.5 g ceftriaxone are as active as 28 g amoxicillin in the treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == the sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. all bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. all strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. only non-identical strains were used. a tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. the results showed that all strains of h. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. the other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. cefoperazone had potent activity against ps. aeruginosa. differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

AB  == an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (sss-iii) is reported. polystyrene  balls with attached anti-sss-iii antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. the reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified sss-iii. for  this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of sss-iii is approximately 2  to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. in preliminary tests with simulated human clinical  specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. cross-reactions were not observed with haemophilus influenzae type b, group b streptococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  == the increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by h. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. an antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against  escherichia coli, proteus spp., enterobacter spp., and haemophilus influenzae. seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. organisms isolated were haemophilus influenzae in 6, e. coli in 3, proteus mirabilis in 2, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. the serratia were  resistant (mic greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other mic's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. two patients died from their underlying disease. adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included sgot rises in 3 and rash in one. serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to  12.5 microgram/ml (trough). sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative  pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == intravenous tmp-smz was used to treat 19 infectious episodes in 18 patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 13 years. thirteen patients with various soft tissue or skeletal infections caused by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pyogenes, or acinetobacter anitratus were successfully treated. three children with four episodes of csf shunt infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci were treated successfully also. the only treatment failures were in two newborn infants with enteric gram-negative bacterial ventriculitis. tmp-smz was given at a daily dose  of 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, every six hours. the drug was administered intravenously for a mean duration of 10 days (range 4 to 32); in 11 patients this was followed by oral administration for a mean of nine days (range 2 to 18). half-life of tmp after intravenous administration was 5 1/4 hours; that of sma was 8 1/2 hours. levels determined three to four days after starting therapy were generally higher than levels obtained at corresponding times after the first dose. csf/blood tmp and sma ratios, determined in four patients, were 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. side effects were observed in 14 patients, and neutropenia was the most common adverse reaction. intravenous tmp-smz is an effective antimicrobic agent in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms. the frequent side effects, although reversible and of no major clinical consequence, suggest that future use of tmp-smz should be monitored closely.

TI  == role of interferon in mice in protection against influenza a virus by bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins of klebsiella pneumoniae as adjuvant.
AB  == nonspecific protection against infectious aerosols of influenza a virus was obtained in swiss mice after vaccination by aerosols of bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins extracted from klebsiella pneumoniae as the adjuvant. it was shown that repeated stimulant aerosols were necessary to obtain  this protection. routine estimation of serum interferon levels after administration of the association of ribosomes plus membranal glycoproteins to the animals by aerosol or intravenous route showed that there was no correlation  between protection and the presence of serum interferon. it was shown that the serum interferon-inducer activity was due to ribosomes. no induction of serum interferon was obtained with membranal glycoproteins used separately. local liberation of interferon in the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract was not investigated.

TI  == indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  == we report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of haemophilus influenzae type b (hi(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with hi(b) meningitis. the assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-hi(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified hi(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. the assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria meningitidis, and listeria monocytogenes. in preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved hi(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from  1 to 7,000 ng/ml. antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which  were culture negative for hi(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than hi(b). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. it seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic hi(b) infections.

TI  == detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  == rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing triton x-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. the most sensitive method was broth culture. by microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. by micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically  easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. the rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for e. coli, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and klebsiella spp. increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. the effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. the isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, and enterococci. however, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for p. aeruginosa and enterococci.

TI  == cefuroxime: a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == cefuroxime is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin for parenteral administration. it is resistant to destruction by beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci and most gram-negative aerobic bacteria and is active against many bacteria resistant to cephalothin. cefuroxime is the most active of the cephalosporins against gonococci and haemophilus influenzae particularly against beta-lactamase producing strains. given by intramuscular or intravenous injection cefuroxime is  effective against a wide variety of infections caused by gram-positive or gram-negative aerobes, but has no effect against infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or b. fragilis. cefuroxime is of value in the treatment of respiratory infections due to haemophilus influenzae and streptocococcus pneumoniae and is useful against cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella and enterobacter infections. cefuroxime is an alternative to spectinomycin for the treatment of beta-lactamase producing neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. it is generally well tolerated and appears not to be nephrotoxic when given alone at usual dosages.

AB  == diplococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequent cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. other frequently isolated bacterial pathogens are hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella organisms, and staphylococcus aureus. the etiologic agents most commonly implicated in hopsital-acquired pneumonias are gram-negative bacilli including e. coli, proteus organisms, and species of klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia. among older children and young-adults, myocoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of penumonia. influenza is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in adults, but there is increasing concern about pulmonary infection due to adenoviruses. in those with a history of travel to endemic areas, the diagnosis of fungal pneumonia due to histoplasma capsulatrum, blastomyces dermatitides, or coccidioides immitis, should be considered. penumonias due to opportunistic fungi (including species of candida,  aspergillus, and phycomycetes) and higher bacteria such as nocardia asteroides are also on the increase, and these arise mostly in compromised hosts. treatment  of pneumonia almost always must be started before culture results are known and in the overwhelming majority of cases, appropriate regimens can be selected after taking an adquate history, doing a careful physical examination, evaluating expectorated sputum for cells and organisms, and examining the chest x-ray. although anti-infective agents are the mainstay of treatment for most infectious  pneumonias, supportive therapy, including adequate tracheobronchial toilet, drainage of abscesses, oxygen inhalation, maintenance of adequate nutrition, and  monitoring for super-infection and anti-infective side effects may be life-saving in certain situations.

TI  == detection of haemophilus influenzae type b antigens in body fluids, using specific antibody-coated staphylococci.
AB  == protein a-rich staphylococci coated with haemophilus influenzae type b antiserum  agglutinate specifically with homologous bacterial cells or with cell-free supernatant fluids of cultures of the organism. antibody-coated staphylococci were used to detect soluble antigens in body fluids of patients infected with h.  influenzae type b. cerebrospinal fluid from 36 cases of meningitis caused by this orgainsm showed positive coagglutination tests in 86% of patients prior to initiation of therapy. antigens could be detected in 46% of sterile cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from the same cases 1 to 10 days after therapy. soluble  antigens were also detectable in sera (58%) and urine specimens (67%) of patients with h. influenzae type b septicemia, when such specimens were tested within 10 days of onset of illness. no antigen could be detected in body fluids beyond 10 days. the coagglutination test was positive in 57% of all body fluids examined; contercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (ccie) was positive in only 27%. all specimens positive by ccie were also positive by coagglutination. no false-positive reactions were noted by either test in body fluids from controls.  the coagglutination test is simple, specific, and more sensitive than the ccie method and could be a valuable tool for detecting antigens in body fluids of patients with various infections.

TI  == rapid automated disgnosis of bacteremia by impedance detection.
AB  == lysis and filtration of blood culture specimens were combined with impedance detection of bacterial growth to facilitate the diagnosis of bacteremia. a blood  lysis-filtration technique (zierdt et al., 1976) was coupled to a simple, inexpensive automated detection system. the practical and technical aspects of the impedance detection system are discussed. this new blood culturing system was compared to a conventional system for 264 aerobic blood cultures. a 30-ml sample  of the blood-broth mixture was withdrawn from the conventional aerobic blood culture bottle and processed in parallel. excluding the isolation of the commonly recognized contaminants, the detection efficiency was 36% greater in the new system. a total of 53 blood cultures from 107 patients were positive by one or both methods. the new system detected 92% of the total number of positive cultures, compared with 56% detected by the routine method. the explanation of the differences is discussed.

TI  == susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  == in vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an  agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. in general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. amikacin was more active than gentamicin  against strains of nocardia asteroides and providencia stuartii and also against  gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably serratia marcescens. however, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. in comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations mics) were greater in tests with mueller-hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those  with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave mics lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of klebsiella pneumoniae. these findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, a new semisynthetic beta-lactam  antibacterial agent with extended broad-spectrum activity.
AB  == in the new agent 3-(5-tetrazolyl)penam, hereafter referred to as cp-35,587, the carboxyl function at c3 in the penicillin nucleus has been replaced with the 5-tetrazolyl moiety. marked changes in spectrum and resistance to gram-negative beta-lactamases, particularly with regard to klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, were conferred by this modification. the anti-klebsiella activity clearly distinguishes the antibacterial spectrum of cp-35,587 from any known broad-spectrum penicillin. compared to orally active cephalosporins, the spectrum advantage of cp-35,587 encompasses enterobacter, serratia marcescens, citrobacter, providencia, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus faecalis, both in vitro and in murine infections produced by many of the above-named microorganisms. thus, cp-35,587 combines and extends the antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum penicillins and orally active cephalosporins.

AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

AB  == cefatrizine (sk&f 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. the average mic values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. in addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. it had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, hemophilus influenzae, proteus morganii or staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. a  variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.

TI  == [chemotherapy of purulent meningitis in children (author's transl)].
AB  == purulent meningitis in patients admitted to the pediatric department of kyoto university hospital and affiliated institutions from 1951 through 1973 were studied with emphasis on the kinds of the causative organisms and the susceptibility of these organisms to antibiotics. the findings in this study have served to help select antibiotics most likely to be effective against this disease. the overall incidence of purulent meningitis was 0.68%. this figure decreased little throughout the period. as for the frequency of causative organisms, neisseria meningitidis led the list, and diplococcus pneumoniae ranked just behind. haemophilus influenzae was rare. the frequency of n. meningitidis, however, decreased sharply in spite of the essentially unchanged overall incidence of this disease. the probable reason for the poor prognosis of this disease in spite of the remarkable strides in chemotherapy is the decreased frequency of n. meningitidis and the inversely increased organisms that are resistant to usual chemotherapy. the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin against this disease was studied in 15 children including eight newborns and four infants. the daily per kg bodyweight dose was 50 mg or less in four, 50 approximately 100 mg in five, and more than 100 mg in the remaining six. the route of administration was either intramuscular or intravenous. no deaths occurred. the rate of effectiveness was as high as 80%. residual symptoms were recorded in six and, in as many as five of them, the cause was a-tributable to the delayed detection of the disease. neither side effects nor aberrent laboratory findings attributable to large doses of cefazolin were recorded. diffusibility of cefazolin into the csf was studied in nine subjects. the csf concentration of this antibiotic was shown to be somewhat lower than that of ampicillin or cephaloridine and to account on an average for 13% of the mean peak serum level. this relatively low diffusibility will be offset by its high serum concentration and safe large-dose therapy. these findings have clearly shown that the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin is as high as that of ampicillin, and  that this excellent effectiveness holds true even when the causative organism happens to be escherichia coli, klebsiella, etc. that are resistant to ampicillin. the authors have furthermore scrutinized much literature on the frequency of the causative organisms, emergence of resistant strains, and the diffusibility of antibiotics into the csf, and arrived at the conclusion that cefazolin is a promising antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in newborn. the daily dose is preferably 150 mg/kg or more given in three divided intravenous doses. meanwhile ampicillin proved to be useful as the  antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in infants and children.

TI  == cephalothin and cephaloridine therapy for bacterial meningitis.
AB  == the efficacy of cephalothin and cephaloridine in the treatment of bacterial meningitis was evaluated from a review of 106 cases reported in the literature. fifty-nine percent of 34 patients treated with intravenous cephalothin responded  suboptimally; those receiving daily doses of 12 g or more fared significantly better (p less than 0.025). in contrast, 74% of 72 patients treated with cephaloridine responded favorably; those who received concomitant intrathecal cephaloridine responded significantly better (p less than 0.005). these findings  indicate that cephalosporin therapy for bacterial meningitis, without concomitant intrathecal medication, is unreliable and that this is probably due to inadequate penetration of the antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid. in penicillin-allergic patients with pneumococcal, meningococcal, and hemophilus meningitis, chloramphenicol is the agent of choice. for staphylococcal meningitis, intravenous cephalothin at doses of 12 g/day with additional intrathecal cephaloridine at doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day should be administered concomitantly.

AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  == a large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. strains of group a hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin g-sensitive staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these  cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. the penicillin  g-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of s. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. strains of enterococci, haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. the activity of cephalexin was very little affected by  ph of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 c in broth for  up to 24 hr. in contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 c, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former.  absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in  the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. the  concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. an average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. both analogues  were well tolerated.
