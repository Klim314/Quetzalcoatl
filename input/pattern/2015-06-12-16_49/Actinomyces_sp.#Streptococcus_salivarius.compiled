TI  - Identification of non-streptococcal organisms from human dental plaque grown on the Streptococcus-selective medium mitis-salivarius agar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mitis-salivarius (MS) agar has been used widely in microbial epidemiological studies because oral viridans streptococci can be selectively grown on this medium. Even though the previous findings reported the limited selecting power of MS agar for streptococcus strains, the identities of non-streptococcal strains from human oral samples which can grow on this medium are not clear yet. In this study, we identified non-streptococcal organisms grown on MS agar plates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. DESIGN: Eighty bacterial colonies on MS plates were isolated from plaque samples, and bacterial identification was achieved with the rapid ID 32 Strep system and mini API reader. The bacterial colonies identified as non-streptococci by the API system were selected for further identification. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and verified using DNA sequencing analysis for identification. Sequences were compared with those of reference organisms in the genome database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). RESULTS: Among the 11 isolated non-streptococcal strains on MS plates, 3 strains were identified as Actinomyces naeslundii, 7 strains were identified as Actinomyces oris and 1 strain were identified as Actinomyces sp. using Blastn. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed that some oral Actinomyces species can grow on Streptococcus-selective MS agar plates.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. METHODS: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and 50 mug/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. RESULTS: Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (P < .001). The HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBD3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - Inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. Most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. FINDINGS: This study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 49456, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 and Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 51655) to the HGF-1 gingival cell line. Extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the Streptococcus strains by up to 4 log CFU/well but effects of other teas and components were small. CONCLUSIONS: Pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.
TI  - Development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. METHODS: Four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. Simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. The LIVE/DEAD BacLight technique (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). Redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. RESULTS: The 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. The biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. A high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. The community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which E. faecalis, L. salivarius, and S. gordonii were most abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. This multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - In situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  - Many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. However, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. As a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus salivarius. Surfaces blasted with Al(2) O(3) (S(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (S(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (S(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned surfaces. Hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. Chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of Ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. After 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii only). The biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Influence of Salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) combined with Salvadora Persica Extract (SPE). METHODS: SPE was added to GIC (Fuji IX) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. The compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. The antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. GIC containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding SPE to GIC (p<0.05). GIC with 2 or 4 % SPE was significantly weaker than the GIC control, while GIC with 1% SPE was not different from the control. The mean values for the 4% SPE-containing specimens and the GIC control group ranged from 108.7MPa to 141.1MPa for CS and from 8.2MPa to 12.5MPa for DTS. The 1% SPE-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control GIC specimens; the 2% SPE-containing specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. As compared with pure GIC the antimicrobial properties of the SPE-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). It has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the GIC with increasing concentrations of SPE. For most microorganisms tested the SPE group inhibited less than Chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure GIC (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SPE could be a promising natural material as an additive to GICs. Further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.
TI  - Degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used were AdheSE (two-step self-etching), Adper Prompt L-Pop (self-etching, single-step) and Excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. The degree of conversion was measured using Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. The absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic C=C was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic C=C peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. Zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. RESULTS: AdheSE showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by Excite, while Adper Prompt L-Pop had the lowest values. A significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between Excite and Adper Prompt L-Pop as well as AdheSE and Adper Prompt L-Pop. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between Excite and AdheSE. Adper Prompt L-Pop showed an antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. AdheSE could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans only. Excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Adper Prompt L-Pop showed the worst degree of conversion. AdheSE and Excite had the highest degree of conversion. Appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.
TI  - DIAGNOdent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. This difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. This study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with DIAGNOdent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect DIAGNOdent readings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. From these, mixed anaerobic flora, Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were cultured in up to three different kinds of culture medium. Colonies of Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. Laboratory teaching strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. Sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. RESULTS: DIAGNOdent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of Prevotella and from colonies of mutans Streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. Lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. Demineralization of enamel did not affect the DIAGNOdent measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The change in fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. The measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.
TI  - [Protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  - Microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific IgA1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. Microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. Nonspecific proteolytic activity was found in the following microorganisms: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Aerococcus viridans, Bifidobacterium longum, Neisseria subflave, Streptococcus parvulus, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Lactobaccilus catenoforme, Bacillus spp. Specific IgA1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards IgG was found in Streptococcus acidominimus, Streptococcus hansenii, Streptococcus salivarius, Leptotrychia buccalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Neisseria sicca. No proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of Eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), Prevotella buccalis, Aerococcus viridans and Streptococcus sanguis.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  - AIM: Compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a UK population using culture-independent techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Halitosis patients were screened according to our recently developed recruitment protocol. Scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The predominant species found in the control samples were Lysobacter-type species, Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Atopobium parvulum and Veillonella atypica. In the halitosis samples, Lysobacter-type species, S. salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, Prevotella veroralis and Prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. For the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). In the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. CONCLUSIONS: The microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.
TI  - Reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. In many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. An alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. intermedia ATCC 49046, and A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 as periodontopathogens. Adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. RESULTS: The largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for P. gingivalis. All antagonistic strains except S. crista ATCC 49999 inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for A. naeslundii ATCC 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). Adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. Intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for P. intermedia, most notably caused by S. mitis BMS. CONCLUSION: The adhesion of P. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while S. mitis BMS appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
TI  - The effect of antibacterial monomer MDPB on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  - MDPB, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-MICs. MICs and MBCs of MDPB for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-MIC on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. All isolates were sensitive to inhibition by MDPB. The median MICs and MBCs of MDPB for these organisms were in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively. As for the influence of pH, inhibition was sensitive to acidic pH. Even at sub-MICs, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. Based on the results of this study, MDPB exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries lesions.
TI  - Effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica; Arak tree) and derum (Juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of Balb/C 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. RESULTS: The data revealed that Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, extracts from both miswak and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. The most sensitive organisms were A. viscosus, followed by S. mutans, S. salivarius, with L. casei being the most resistant. CONCLUSION: The results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - [Comparison of Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and Galla  Chinesis in bioflim model. To evaluate the feasibility of application of Gala Chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. In the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. After a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the HA disc was examed, the planktonic pH in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the HA disc was observed by SEM. RESULTS: (1) Galla Chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic pH in the flow cell, but Galla Chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) The biofilms formed after application of Galla Chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.
TI  - Mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. Our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. METHODS: The experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. Standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. RESULTS: We found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus salivarius or Actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a pH-dependent manner. The results of experiments with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. However, direct fluoride inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. Results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to those of S. salivarius with pH-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and indirect inhibition of urease. CONCLUSION: Fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - The microflora of the erupting first permanent molar.
AB  - The relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. A significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. Fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of Actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. Logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased numbers of Streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of Actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. Significantly greater numbers and proportions of S. oralis and S. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas Streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. This study suggests that organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.
TI  - [Analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. METHODS: The oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. By choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. The strains were identified by observing colony characteristics, Gram staining and biochemical tests. RESULTS: S. salivarius was the most frequent microflora, followed by S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. Veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, A. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. L. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. Leptotrichia buccalis and Capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. CONCLUSION: S. solivarius and S. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, Veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. A. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. With the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of silver inorganic agent YDA filler.
AB  - YDA filler is an antibacterial agent that is currently in commercial dental use.  In this study, we attempted to determine whether it exerts an antibacterial effect on human saliva bacteria, and to determine whether it can be used in dental materials. CFUs in 1 mL stimulated human saliva were examined using blood agar and mitis salivarius agar after immersion, with or without YDA filler. The antibacterial effect was compared with that of Ketac-Silver. Dental materials containing 5% wt YDA filler were prepared for in vitro testing on S. mutans and A. viscosus. Furthermore, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of experimental MMA resin containing YDA filler on HeLa cells. Human saliva bacteria and mutans streptococci showed reduced viability following exposure to YDA filler after 12 h. The concentration of silver ions released by YDA filler was below 1 ppm after 12 h. Two tested strains showed reduced viability following exposure to dental materials containing YDA filler. In another experiment, MMA resin containing YDA filler did not show cytotoxicity on HeLa cells after 24- and 48-h exposure. Thus, YDA filler may help in the development of antibacterial dental materials, such as composite resin, glass-ionomer or temporary cement.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Bacteriophage isolation from human saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteriophages for Gram-positive oral pathogens in human saliva.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples from 31 donors were screened for the presence of bacteriophages for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteriophages for Enterococcus faecalis were found in seven samples. Enterococcus faecalis phages were still present in saliva re-collected from one donor one month, and one year after initial saliva collection. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and stability of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages in human saliva suggests a possible role of these bacteriophages in the oral ecosystem. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phage therapy as a way to control oral bacteria might be considered.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of ZnCl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  - Although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of Zn on different organisms under both fixed pH and free-fall conditions. Here, the effect of ZnCl(2) on Streptococcus salivarius, Strep. mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. pH-stat experiments were performed at pH 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; pH-fall experiments started at pH 7. In both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for Zn and lactate determinations. Under pH-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by Zn most strongly in Strep. sobrinus and Strep. salivarius. In terms of total acid production averted, however, the effect of Zn under both pH-stat and pH-fall conditions was clearly greatest with Strep. salivarius. A. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under pH-stat conditions. Cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mM initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mM). Packed cell layers responded to Zn quite differently from suspensions, the pH often falling in the presence of 1mM Zn at a rate similar to the no Zn control. As streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both pH-stat and pH-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as A. naeslundii.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Alteration of the coadherence of Candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  - Interactions between bacterial oral flora and Candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. This study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of C. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. When yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) supplemented with 250 mM glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of Streptoccus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. However, when the yeast was precultured in YNB supplemented with 500 mM galactose, the yeast coadhered with S. salivarius and Actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in YNB with glucose. In addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of S. sanguis was significantly reduced. Enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dentin bonding systems, polyacid-modified composite resins and composite resins.
AB  - This study examined the antibacterial activities of the bonding systems Syntac, EBS and Scotchbond 1, the polyacid-modified composite resins Hytac and Compoglass, and the composite resins Tetric, Z100 and Scalp-it. They were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus sorbinus and Actinomyces viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All adhesives of the dentin bonding systems and the polyacid-modified composite resins exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. On the contrary, composite resins did not affect bacterial growth. The data suggest that the use of these adhesives and polyacid-modified composite resins may reduce the consequences of microleakage owing to their antibacterial properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cavity disinfectants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of four commercially available cavity disinfectants and one prescription mouthwash as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. Streptococcus mutans, salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus were used in the study. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results of this study indicate that all of the antimicrobial agents demonstrated activity against the bacteria tested. Consepsis Solution produced the largest zones of inhibition against all three of the bacteria used.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Time-dependent interfacial tension of whole saliva and saliva-bacteria mixes.
AB  - Using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. The reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of Streptococcus salivarius KRF2, S. sanguis KRF3, and Actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. The results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentin bonding systems, resin-modified glass ionomers,  and polyacid-modified composite resins.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Syntac, ProBOND, Gluma 3-Step, the resin-modified glass ionomers Photac-Fil, Fuji Lining LC, Fuji II LC, and the polyacid-modified composite resins VariGlass, Geristore, and Infinity were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria S mutans, L salivarius, S sobrinus, and A viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All glass ionomers, the polyacid-modified composites, and the primers and adhesives of the dentin bonding systems exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against most of the test bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the adhesives of dentin bonding systems was anticipated because of the glutaraldehyde used in their formulations. However, the antibacterial activity of the various primers was unexpected and indicates a dual antibacterial action of these systems.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. A class I cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. The blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. In addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of L. Casei with S. sobrinus or A. viscosus were also prepared. Half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the pH of the medium was measured. After 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by Brown-Brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. The final pH of the S. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. Bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the S. salivarius group. Among the monoinfection groups, the S. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the A. Viscosus group and the L. casei group. The invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. Immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by L. casei, and not by S. sobrinus and A. viscosus. The invasion rate by L. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either S. sobrinus or A. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. These findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to dental amalgam and three resin composites.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The ability of three oral bacteria to adhere to hydrophobic amalgam (water contact angle 60 degrees) and hydrophobic resin composites (Prisma-AP.H 56 degrees. Herculite XRV 82 degrees and Z100 89 degrees) was compared using an in vitro assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following preincubation of the materials with human saliva, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the surfaces to adsorb carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds in a conditioning film that appeared to block the detection of Na and others in 2100 resin. Hg and Ag in amalgam, Si and Zn in Prisma AP.H resin and Ag and Na in Herculite resin. The precoating of the substrata by a proteinaceous conditioning film led to decreased binding of viable cells of Streptococcus sanguis CH3, Streptococcus salivarius HB and Actinomyces viscosus WG as compared with the adhesion to bare composites. With and without salivary coating, there was a correlation between increased bacterial hydrophobicity and increased retention on the substrata. However, there was no statistical difference in binding to the amalgam compared with the resin composites. In vitro studies showed that the bacteria autoaggregated in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the potential ability of normal oral flora to colonize resin composite.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  - The ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. Of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. Lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus crista and tufted Streptococcus sanguis II strains. Lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with S. gordonii and S. sanguis. The coaggregation between L. salivarius and S. salivarius, S. gordonii or tufted S. sanguis II strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. The coaggregation between L. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - The resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  - Selected strains of oral Streptococcus and Actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. Strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. Sensitivities were initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. Streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/mL to 40 micrograms/mL) than Actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/mL to 30 micrograms/mL). The most resistant streptococci included S. mitis biovar 1, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and one strain of S. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/mL of mercury. Two other S. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/mL mercury. The most resistant Actinomyces was A. naeslundii genospecies 1 (ATCC12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/mL mercury; two strains of Actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/mL. Mercury caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. Enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. S. oralis and S. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/mL mercury. Mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Use of a replica-plate assay for the rapid assessment of salivary protein-bacteria interactions.
AB  - A replica-plate assay was used to screen for the interaction of salivary molecules with dental plaque bacteria. Bacterial colonies cultured from supragingival plaque on sheep-blood (SB) agar were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose membranes overlaying SB or mitis-salivarius agar. Membranes with attached colonies were removed and incubated with 125I-amylase or 125I-proline-rich glycoprotein (PRG). Positive interactions were detected by autoradiography. Only strains of Streptococcus gordonii and Actinomyces viscosus bound amylase, and strains of A. viscosus bound PRG. The results suggest that amylase and PRG bind to selected species of aerobic dental plaque bacteria.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - An examination of strains of the bacterium Streptococcus vestibularis for relative cariogenicity in gnotobiotic rats and adhesion in vitro.
AB  - The cariogenicity and adhesion of six strains of Streptococcus vestibularis were  compared with those of strains of Strep. salivarius. All strains of Strep. vestibularis produced low levels of caries, confined to the fissures, whereas the two strains of Strep. salivarius produced high levels of caries, with one strain producing approximal as well as fissure caries. The values for adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite of Strep. vestibularis in the absence (median 4.74%) and the presence (median 4.67%) of sucrose were not statistically different, nor did they differ significantly from those of Strep. salivarius. Strains of Strep. vestibularis were able to adhere to buccal epithelial cells (median 1.19%) as well as could Strep. salivarius strain HB (1.65%). Neither sucrose nor saliva greatly aggregated the strains of either species. Strep. vestibularis did not adhere to hexadecane (median 18.5%) to the same extent as did Strep. salivarius strains (median 69%). There was a significant correlation between the adhesion in the presence and absence of sucrose (p less than 0.01). Strep. vestibularis strains could not coaggregate with either actinomycetes or Veillonella spp. whereas Strep. salivarius strains were able to coaggregate with Veillonella spp.
TI  - The influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  - Sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. Sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. When sucrolose was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar pH falls, compared with controls. The incorporation of 126 mmol/L sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, Streptococcus sanguis 10904, Streptococcus sanguis Challis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus WVU627. Sucralose had no effect on IPS production. Sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. Sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. No radioactive polymer was formed from 14C-U-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (GTF) or fructosyl-transferase (FTF). Inhibition of GTF and FTF by sucralose was removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. These results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on GTF and FTF was non-competitive and reversible. The results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.
TI  - pH regulation of urease levels in Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - Potential mechanisms for regulation of urease levels in Streptococcus salivarius  were examined, including: induction by urea, nitrogen or carbon source repression, and effects of pH and CO2 (because CO2 enrichment enhanced urease detection on urea agar plates). Regulation by either pH or CO2 was confirmed by comparison of the urease accumulation pattern during anaerobic growth under CO2 with that under N2. Under CO2, there was an initial buffering plateau at pH 6.2 and a rate of Streptococcus salivarius urease accumulation three-fold that under N2, with a pH 7.6 plateau. With both gas phases there was also an increase in the rate of urease appearance coincident with the decrease in medium pH following the pH plateau. The effects of pH, CO2, and HCO3- on urease levels and on growth were separately assessed by culture in media containing 0, 25, 100 mmol/L KHCO3 buffered at different pH levels. There was an inverse relationship between the logarithm of the urease level after 24-hour growth and the pH during growth-the urease specific activity was 100-fold higher at pH 5.5, compared with pH 7.0 and above. HCO3-/CO2 (100 mmol/L) had little effect on urease levels, but was essential for growth at pH 5.5. There was no significant urease induction by urea, or repression by ammonia or glucose. There was also evidence of pH regulation of urease levels in some staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Corynebacterium renale, but not in Actinomyces naeslundii and several other species. We conclude that the external pH is a major factor regulating urease levels in S. salivarius and possibly some other species-a mechanism equivalent to urease repression by OH-.
TI  - An in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  - An in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. The assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Capnocytophaga species, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus species, Veillonella species, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. Approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to enamel, including the fresh isolates of B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, Veillonella species and S. sanguis. Adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. Three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. The assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  - Physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion to intact dental tissue slabs. In addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. Strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, A. viscosus, and A. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mJ.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. Very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. Powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in the physiological buffer. The surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. The adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.
TI  - Bacterial involvement in denture-induced stomatitis.
AB  - Denture and mucosal plaque samples were collected from eight full-denture wearers of whom four suffered from denture-induced stomatitis (DIS). Cultures were made, and a proportional identification to species level was carried out of bacteria and yeasts. An inventory was made of the predominant flora. Results showed that the predominant microflora of both groups, both on dentures and the denture-bearing mucosa, consisted mainly of Gram-positive bacteria. Differences in the proportions of cocci were found between the predominant bacterial flora on the dentures. In the control group, 69% of the denture flora consisted of cocci, while on the dentures of the DIS group a mean of 33% cocci was found. Neither group of palates revealed any differences in the proportions of cocci. On these locations a mean of 69% was found. The plaque of dentures and the palates of the healthy group showed means of 35% and 31%, respectively, of obligate anaerobic bacteria, while in the DIS group these percentages were 56% and 43%, respectively. No obligately aerobic bacteria were found. Candida species was detected in both groups, both on dentures and palates in very low numbers (DIS group, median palates 0.02%, median dentures 0.25%). The predominant organisms were Streptococcus species, of which S. salivarius was mostly present on the palates of both groups. Other species which were regularly found at different locations were Veillonella parvula and species of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Actinomyces.
TI  - Coaggregation properties of human oral Veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  - The primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. Isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. All 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were Veillonella atypica or Veillonella dispar. All but one of them coaggregated with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. These tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the subgingival flora such as Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Streptococcus sanguis. In contrast, 24 of 29 Veillonella isolates, of which 20 were Veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of Actinomyces, S. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with S. salivarius. The majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. These results indicate that the three human oral Veillonella species are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Gallotannins inhibit growth, water-insoluble glucan synthesis, and aggregation of mutans streptococci.
AB  - During screening for anti-plaque agents of plant origin, ethanolic extracts from  Melaphis chinensis (Bell), the Chinese Nutgall, exhibited strong inhibition of glucosyltransferase (GTF), in vitro adherence and glucan-induced agglutination of Streptococcus mutans 3209 and S. sobrinus B13. More than 91% inhibition of water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by GTF was noted at a concentration as low as 7.8 micrograms/mL. Bactericidal effects on other mutans streptococci, S. salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus were also evident. Through chemical fractionation and analyses, along with bioassays, the active components were identified as gallotannins.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. Mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. Reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with the saline/buffer controls. A significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, and Candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. Five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to S. salivarius.Five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.The results indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. The exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.
TI  - Microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  - This study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. The isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. During the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. Under equal conditions root surfaces were more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. However, the composition of the microbiota was the same. Within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and Gram-positive pleomorphic rods. S. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas S. mitis and S. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. The relative proportion of S. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of S. salivarius and arginine-positive S. mitis showed a declining tendency. Actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. In one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling Stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. The time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.
TI  - Metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by Streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  - Resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. Most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. Streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. We therefore looked for a specific enzyme in S. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. Fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from S. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. Purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. These results suggest that the high fermentative efficiency of glycosylsucrose by S. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. The partially purified fructosyltransferases of Actinomyces viscosus NY1 and Streptococcus mutans NCIB 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. The fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - Longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  - Intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. Bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. Microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and Veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. The microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. Streptococci, especially S. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Extracts from human dental plaque, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelli and Actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3H]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of HeLa cells. The results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.
TI  - Sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  - 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. The type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. The enzyme activities were determined as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Although variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains, the same general pattern was noticed. Strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii. Most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like S. sanguis and S. mitior. In some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. The level of sucrase activity in S. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype V/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes I and IV corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype III/serotype a always showed low activity. In most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. In all species, exept S. sanguis and S. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. On the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.
TI  - Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  - Oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. Strains of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. Strains of B. intermedius, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and B. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. An overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. This suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. Pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of S. sanguis and A. viscosus and increased numbers of S. mutans. Analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the S. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. Absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl Sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. These observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. The data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.
TI  - Binding of 18F by cell membranes and cell walls of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The binding of 18F to isolated cell membranes and cell walls of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 or other bacteria was assayed. The attachment of 18F to these cell envelopes proceeded slowly and reached equilibrium within 60 min. 18F binding was stimulated by Ca2+ (1 mM). The binding of 18F to cellular components was dependent upon the pH, as well as the amount of 18F and dose of the binder employed. The binding of 18F by cell walls prepared from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant cells of S. salivarius and S. mutans did not differ significantly. The pretreatment of cell walls or cell membranes for 60 min at 30 degrees C with 1 mg of RNase, DNase, or trypsin per ml did not influence the binding of 18F by the walls and membranes of S. mutans GS-5. However, prior exposure of cell membranes to sodium dodecyl sulfate caused a significant reduction in the number of 18F atoms bound by the membranes. In saturated assay systems, cell membranes of S. mutans GS-5 bound 10(15) to 10(16) atoms of 18F per mg (dry weight), whereas cell walls from S. mutans GS-5, FA-1, and HS-6 or Actinomyces viscosus T14V and T14AV bound 10(12) to 10(13) atoms of 18F per mg (dry weight). 18F in this quantity (10(12) to 10(13) atoms) cannot be detected with the fluoride electrode. The data provide, for the first time, a demonstration of 18F binding by cell membranes and walls of oral flora.
TI  - Coaggregation of human oral Cytophaga species and Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - A total of 19 strains of oral Cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. mitis. Coaggregation was observed only with A. israelii. Based on their coaggregation patterns with eight A. israelii strains, the Cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with A. israelii PK16 but not with A. israelii W1011 (ATCC 29322), those that coaggregated with A. israelii ATCC 29322 but not with A. israelii PK16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight A. israelii strains. In each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees C, 30 min) of the Cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the A. israelii cells had no effect. The ability of A. israelii PK16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with Cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the coaggregating Cytophaga strains. White patches of A. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored Cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well as the enamel surface to which Cytophaga strains do not adhere. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. In addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on A. israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative Cytophaga sp. The kinetics of binding of A. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of available binding sites on both substrata. These results indicate the highly specific nature of Cytophaga sp.--A. israelii recognition. The contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - An extracellular soluble common protein (ECP) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, of a representative strain of each of Bratthall's seven serological groups of Streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of Lactobacillus salivarius and Actinomyces viscosus. The ECP antigens from the different strains were prepared from SDS-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. The identity of such purified ECP antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in SDS-PAGE, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. This common antigen (ECP) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  - Plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. Twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. Streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, Streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and S. sanguis constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). A few isolates of "S. mitior" and "S. milleri" were found, but no S. salivarius. Staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). Gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). Of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. Arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). Gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). Only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. Although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of S. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. The large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.
TI  - Microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low pH isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  - Longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. Differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml) at pH levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both pH and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. Strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at pH levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. The most commonly isolated streptococci were Streptococcus mitior and S. salivarius. S. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at pH 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at pH 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. Despite their known fluoride resistance, Actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. The pH of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at pH 6.0 was only 30% of that at pH 7.0. Representative strains of S. mutans, S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the pH and fluoride levels of the medium on which they were initially isolated. Fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. The isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the pH range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. Fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric S. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. In the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may permit S. mitior to compete with S. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.
TI  - Adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by Streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - Several strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of Streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. Bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees C and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as the substrate. Mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. The greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with S. sanguis (biotype I), serotype b of S. mutans, and the fresh S. salivarius isolates. The lowest mean depletion was noted with S. mitis (15%) and biotype II S. sanguis (ca. 30%). The remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. In studies with S. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees C, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees C was very similar. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. With S. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. The extent of adsorption, however, was independent of pH's of 3.9 to 8.3. When a low concentration of S. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20 mug of lysozyme added per ml. Salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral microorganisms (A. viscosus WVU 626 and WVU 627, S. sanguis 73x11, S. mutans BHT, and S. salivarius NG) was similar to that of S. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. Lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees C. On the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. A comparison of pH and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (GlcNAc)(4) suggested that adsorption by S. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. The possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.
TI  - Interference of secretory immunoglobulin A with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The potential of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (HA) beads. The importance of specific S-IgA antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral S-IgA, polymeric myeloma IgA, or preabsorbed S-IgA. Specific antibody molecules bound at the HA surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two Streptococcus sanguis strains. In contrast, HA-bound S-IgA antibodies inhibited the sorption of Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. The same was true for Streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. Suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to HA. Comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of IgA or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with S-IgA or myeloma IgA added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with S. Sanguis, S. mitior, S. salivarius, and glucose-grown S. mutans was partly attributable to functions of S-IgA antibodies. Under the in vitro conditions of the study, S-IgA antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown S. mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii to HA. The results indicated that S-IgA can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to HA by several different functions.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Soluble extracellular antigens (ESA) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Bio-Gel P6 column. Soluble cell wall antigens (WEA) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). Antisera against whole cells of S. sanguis and S. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell walls, dextran, ESA, and WEA were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. ESA and WEA were prepared from a representative strain of Bratthall's seven serological groups, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus. All sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. The comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both ESA and WEA between the different strains. Absorption of anti-ESA sera with WEA, and anti-WEA sera with ESA, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. Enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in ESA and WEA.
TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Structure of extracellular water-soluble polysaccharides synthesized from sucrose by oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.
TI  - Selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by Streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and A. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (BGR) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. The bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type A or B reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the A and B antigenic determinants were not involved. The organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of BGR mucin molecules because preparations absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained BGR molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed BGR components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. Differences were even noted among S. mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. Immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. Mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to S. mutans H12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups played an essential role. Active cell metabolism was not required for BGR mucin binding; however, pretreatment of H12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees C for 15 min) reduced binding. Mucin labeled with [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to S. mutans H12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. Binding of [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. However, binding was inhibited by several amines. BGR salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.
TI  - Factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  - Various factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture pH values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5.5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final pH values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees C) occurred rapidly at pH values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher pH values. Aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low pH and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. Low pH values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of extracellular products from oral bacteria on human fibroblasts and stimulated lymphocytes.
AB  - Extracellular products of 12 strains of Streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (HeLa and AV3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. Products from S. mutans strains AHT and BHT, Streptococcus intermedius, and Actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Products from S. mutans E49, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth of fibroblastoid cells. Preparations from S. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and Sephadex G-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory activity seen with the two cell types. The molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and Ultragel AcA34, was approximately 160,000. The results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.
TI  - Comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - The adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated HA surfaces for strain of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. Adsorption to untreated HA was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly Ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to HA. More complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated HA since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. This indicates that adsorbed salivary components on HA surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. Fewer cells of strains of S. mutans, S. salivarius, and A. naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated HA than to untreated HA because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. Substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, and A. viscosus adsorbed to saliva-treated HA because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the number of adsorption sites for these strains. The affinity constants for all but one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated HA than on untreated HA. The number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated HA more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. Although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of S. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated HA did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered HA surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of Streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  - An indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of Streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. An electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. This labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. Although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with S. salivarius and S. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. These cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. No cross-reactions occurred with S. mutans, S. faecalis, Actinomyces species, or Bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. Appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.
TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
