TI  == comparison of the compositions of the stool microbiotas of infants fed goat milk  formula, cow milk-based formula, or breast milk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.
