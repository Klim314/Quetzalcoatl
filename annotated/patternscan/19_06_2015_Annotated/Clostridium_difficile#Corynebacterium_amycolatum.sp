TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, quinupristin- dalfopristin, linezolid, and five other antimicrobials against 307 gram-positive anaerobic and  31 corynebacterium clinical isolates.
AB  == the activities of daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, and eight other agents were determined against 338 strains of gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and corynebacteria by the nccls reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella agar for the anaerobes and mueller-hinton agar for the corynebacteria. the daptomycin mics determined on ca(2+)-supplemented (50 mg/liter) brucella agar plates were one- to fourfold lower than those determined in unsupplemented media. daptomycin was highly active (mics, <or=2 microg/ml) against many strains including 36 of 37 peptostreptococci, 37 of 48 isolates of the eubacterium group, and all strains of propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and other clostridium spp. it was fourfold or greater more active than vancomycin against clostridium innocuum and 16 of 34 strains of vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli. three strains of c. difficile for which quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid mics were >8 microg/ml were inhibited by  <1 microg of daptomycin per ml. daptomycin mics were >or=4 microg/ml for most strains of clostridium clostridioforme, clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium tertium, and clostridium ramosum; the isolates were generally more resistant to other antimicrobials. daptomycin was two- to fourfold less active against actinomyces spp. than vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or linezolid. twenty-nine of 31 strains of corynebacterium spp., including corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of daptomycin per ml. for two strains of "corynebacterium aquaticum," 8 microg of daptomycin per ml was required for inhibition. daptomycin demonstrated very good activities against a broad range of gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant c. innocuum and lactobacillus strains and quinupristin-dalfopristin- and linezolid-resistant c. difficile strains.
