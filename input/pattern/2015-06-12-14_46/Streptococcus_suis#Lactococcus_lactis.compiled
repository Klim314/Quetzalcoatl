TI  - Restoration of bioactive lantibiotic suicin from a remnant lan locus of pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. Their biosynthesis genes are usually organized in gene clusters, which are mainly found in Gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic streptococci. Three highly virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains (98HAH33, 05ZYH33, and SC84) have been shown to contain an 89K pathogenicity island. Here, on these islands, we unveiled and reannotated a putative lantibiotic locus designated sui which contains a virulence-associated two-component regulator, suiK-suiR. In silico analysis revealed that the putative lantibiotic modification gene suiM was interrupted by a 7.9-kb integron and that other biosynthesis-related genes contained various frameshift mutations. By reconstituting the intact suiM in Escherichia coli together with a semi-in vitro biosynthesis system, a putative lantibiotic named suicin was produced with bactericidal activities against a variety of Gram-positive strains, including pathogenic streptococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ring topology dissection indicated that the 34-amino-acid lantibiotic contained two methyllanthionine residues and one disulfide bridge, which render suicin in an N-terminal linear and C-terminal globular shape. To confirm the function of suiK-suiR, SuiR was overexpressed and purified. In vitro analysis showed that SuiR could specifically bind to the suiA gene promoter. Its coexpression with suiK could activate suiA gene promoter in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Conclusively, we obtained a novel lantibiotic suicin by restoring its production from the remnant sui locus and demonstrated that virulence-associated SuiK-SuiR regulates its production.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of nisin against the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis and its synergistic interaction with antibiotics.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs, including meningitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. Furthermore, this bacterium is considered an emerging zoonotic agent. Recently, increased antibiotic resistance in S. suis has been reported worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of nisin, a bacteriocin of the lantibiotic class, as an antibacterial agent against the pathogen S. suis serotype 2. In addition, the synergistic activity of nisin in combination with conventional antibiotics was assessed. Using a plate assay, the nisin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 proved to be capable of inhibiting the growth of S. suis (n=18) belonging to either sequence type (ST)1, ST25, or ST28. In a microdilution broth assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of purified nisin ranged between 1.25 and 5 mug/mL while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was between 5 and 10 mug/mL toward S. suis. The use of a capsule-deficient mutant of S. suis indicated that the presence of this polysaccharidic structure has no marked impact on susceptibility to nisin. Following treatment of S. suis with nisin, transmission electron microscopy observations revealed lysis of bacteria resulting from breakdown of the cell membrane. A time-killing curve showed a rapid bactericidal activity of nisin. Lastly, synergistic effects of nisin were observed in combination with several antibiotics, including penicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ceftiofur. This study brought clear evidence supporting the potential of nisin for the prevention and treatment of S. suis infections in pigs.
TI  - Identification of a novel virulence determinant with serum opacification activity in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. In other streptococci, large surface-associated proteins (>100 kDa) of the MSCRAMM family (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) are key players in interactions with host tissue. In this study, we identified a novel opacity factor of S. suis (OFS) with structural homology to members of the MSCRAMM family. The N-terminal region of OFS is homologous to the respective regions of fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBA) of Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the serum opacity factor (SOF) of Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar to these two proteins, the N-terminal domain of OFS opacified horse serum. Serum opacification activity was detectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of wild-type S. suis but not in extracts of isogenic ofs knockout mutants. Heterologous expression of OFS in Lactococcus lactis demonstrated that a high level of expression of OFS is sufficient to provide surface-associated serum opacification activity. Furthermore, serum opacification could be inhibited by an antiserum against recombinant OFS. The C-terminal repetitive sequence elements of OFS differed significantly from the respective repeat regions of FnBA and SOF as well as from the consensus sequence of the fibronectin-binding repeats of MSCRAMMs. Accordingly, fibronectin binding was not detectable in recombinant OFS. To investigate the putative function of OFS in the pathogenesis of invasive S. suis diseases, piglets were experimentally infected with an isogenic mutant strain in which the ofs gene had been knocked out by an in-frame deletion. The mutant was severely attenuated in virulence but not in colonization, demonstrating that OFS represents a novel virulence determinant of S. suis.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - Evidence for horizontal transfer of SsuDAT1I restriction-modification genes to the Streptococcus suis genome.
AB  - Different strains of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (R-M) system or lacked it. The R-M system was an isoschizomer of Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the R-M system in S. suis DAT1, designated SsuDAT1I, showed that the SsuDAT1I gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuMA and ssuMB, as does the DpnII system. The deduced amino acid sequences of M. SsuMA and M.SsuMB showed 70 and 90% identity to M.DpnII and M.DpnA, respectively. However, the SsuDAT1I system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssuRA and ssuRB. The deduced amino acid sequence of R.SsuRA was 49% identical to that of R.DpnII, and R.SsuRB was 72% identical to R.LlaDCHI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris DCH-4. The four SsuDAT1I genes overlapped and were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purF-purM-purN-purH-ssuMA-ssuMB-ssuRA++ +-ssuRB-purD-purE. The G+C content of the SsuDAT1I gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the SsuDAT1I system. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. The SsuDAT1I genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the R-M system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuMA to 5 bp downstream of ssuRB was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purH and purD and that the insertion target site was not the recognition site of SsuDAT1I. No notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. These results suggest that the SsuDAT1I system could have been integrated into the S. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
