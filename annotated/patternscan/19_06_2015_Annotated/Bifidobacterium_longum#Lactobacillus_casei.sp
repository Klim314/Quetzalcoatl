TI  == reduction of phytate in soy drink by fermentation with lactobacillus casei expressing phytases from bifidobacteria.
AB  == plant-based food products can be modified by fermentation to improve flavour and  the concentration of some biologically active compounds, but also to increase the mineral availability by eliminating anti-nutrient substances such as phytates. the objective of this study was to develop a fermented soybean drink with improved nutritional quality and source of probiotic bacteria by including as starter for fermentation lactobacillus casei strains modified to produce phytase  enzymes from bifidobacteria. the l. casei strains showed a good adaptation to develop in the soy drink but they needed the addition of external carbohydrates to give rise to an efficient acidification. the strain expressing the bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum phytase was able to degrade more than 90 % phytate during product fermentation, whereas expression of bifidobacterium longum spp. infantis phytase only led to 65 % hydrolysis. in both cases, accumulation of myo-inositol triphosphates was observed. in addition, the hydrolysis of phytate in soy drink fermented with the l. casei strain expressing the b. pseudocatenulatum phytase resulted in phytate/mineral ratios for fe (0.35) and zn (2.4), which were below the critical values for reduced mineral bioavailability in humans. this investigation showed the ability of modified l. casei to produce  enzymes with technological relevance in the design of new functional foods.

TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == effect of salt on cell viability and membrane integrity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum as observed by flow cytometry.
AB  == the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of varying sodium chloride concentrations (0-5%) on viability and membrane integrity of three probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum, using conventional technique and flow cytometry. double staining of cells by carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cfda) and propidium iodide (pi) enabled to evaluate the effect of nacl on cell esterase activity and membrane integrity. observations from conventional culture technique were compared with findings from flow cytometric analysis on the metabolic activities  of the cells and a correlation was observed between culturability and dye extrusion ability of l. casei and b. longum. however, a certain population of l.  acidophilus was viable as per the plate count method but its efflux activity was  compromised. esterase activity of most bacteria reduced significantly (p < 0.05)  during one week storage at nacl concentrations greater than 3.5%. the study revealed that l. casei was least affected by higher nacl concentrations among the three probiotic bacteria, as opposed to b. longum where the cf extrusion performance was greatly reduced during 1 wk storage. the metabolic activity and salt resistance of l. casei was found to be highest among the bacteria studied.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == probiotic modulation of dendritic cell function is influenced by ageing.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are critical for the generation of t-cell responses. dc function may be modulated by probiotics, which confer health benefits in immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly. this study investigated the effects of four probiotics, bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486, b. longum sp 07/3, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (l.gg) and l. casei shirota (lcs), on  dc function in an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction (mlr) model, using dcs and  t-cells from young and older donors in different combinations. all four probiotics enhanced expression of cd40, cd80 and ccr7 on both young and older dcs, but enhanced cytokine production (tgf-beta, tnf-alpha) by old dcs only. lcs  induced il-12 and ifngamma production by dc to a greater degree than other strains, while b. longum bv. infantis ccug 52486 favoured il-10 production. stimulation of young t cells in an allogeneic mlr with dc was enhanced by probiotic pretreatment of old dcs, which demonstrated greater activation (cd25) than untreated controls. however, pretreatment of young or old dcs with lps or probiotics failed to enhance the proliferation of t-cells derived from older donors. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that ageing increases the responsiveness of dcs to probiotics, but this is not sufficient to overcome the impact of immunosenescence in the mlr.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == the applications of polysaccharides from various mushroom wastes as prebiotics in different systems.
AB  == the bases or stipes of mushrooms are normally discarded as low-economic value animal feed and compost. there are no known reports on deriving polysaccharides from these mushroom wastes for use as prebiotics. this study showed that the relatively low concentration (0.1% to 0.5%) of polysaccharides from lentinula edodes stipe, pleurotus eryngii base, and flammulina velutipes base can enhance the survival rate of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum during cold storage. the polysaccharides had synergistic effects with the peptides and amino acids from a yogurt culture to maintain probiotics above 10(7) cfu/ml during cold storage, and they also had significant protective effects on these probiotics in simulated gastric and bile  juice conditions to achieve beneficial effects in the host. these results showed  that mushroom wastes, which are cheaper than other sources, could be an important, new, alternative source of prebiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == evidence of immunomodulatory effects of a novel probiotic, bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486 was originally isolated from healthy elderly subjects and demonstrated to have particular ecological fitness and anti-pathogenic effects. bifidobacteria are commonly associated with immuno-modulatory properties, especially in older people, but this strain has not been investigated for effects on immune function. this study aimed to explore the immunomodulatory effects of this novel probiotic, compared with three commercial  strains, b. longum sp 07/3, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (l.gg) and lactobacillus casei shirota (lcs). human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated from fasting blood of young or older volunteers and exposed to probiotic strains or con a. nk activity and activation, and cytokine release was enhanced by all probiotics with strain specificities. the effect of b. infantis on nk activity was influenced by ageing. except for l.gg, probiotics increased ifn-gamma production to a much greater degree in young subjects and increased il-6 production to a much greater degree in older subjects. based on il-10/il-12  ratios, b. infantis resulted in the most anti-inflammatory profile of all of the  probiotics. these results suggest that b. infantis ccug 52486 has strong immunomodulatory potential compared with well-known commercial strains and that the immune response to probiotics may be influenced by ageing.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == effect of garlic powder on the growth of commensal bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == garlic (allium sativum) is considered one of the best disease-preventive foods. we evaluated in vitro the effect of a commercial garlic powder (gp), at concentrations of 0.1% and 1% (w/v), upon the viability of representative gut bacteria. in pure culture studies, lactobacillus casei dsmz 20011 was essentially found to be resistant to gp whereas a rapid killing effect of between 1 and 3 log cfu/ml reduction in cell numbers was observed with bacteroides ovatus, bifidobacterium longum dsmz 20090 and clostridium nexile a2-232. after 6h incubation, bacterial numbers increased steadily and once the strains became resistant they retained their resistant phenotype upon sub-culturing. a colonic model was also used to evaluate the effect of gp on a mixed bacterial population  representing the microbiota of the distal colon. lactic acid bacteria were found  to be more resistant to gp compared to the clostridial members of the gut microbiota. while for most bacteria the antimicrobial effect was transient, the lactobacilli showed a degree of resistance to garlic, indicating that its consumption may favour the growth of these beneficial bacterial species in the gut. garlic intake has the potential to temporarily modulate the gut microbiota.

AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == effect of prebiotics on viability and growth characteristics of probiotics in soymilk.
AB  == background: soy products have attracted much attention lately as carriers for probiotics. this study was aimed at enhancing the growth of probiotics in soymilk via supplementation with prebiotics. results: lactobacillus sp. ftdc 2113, lactobacillus acidophilus ftdc 8033, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus casei atcc 393, bifidobacterium ftdc 8943 and bifidobacterium longum ftdc 8643 were evaluated for their viability and growth characteristics in prebiotic-supplemented soymilk. in the presence of fructooligosaccharides (fos),  inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin, all strains showed viability exceeding 7 log(10) colony-forming units ml(-1) after 24 h. their growth was significantly  (p < 0.05) increased on supplementation with maltodextrin, pectin, mannitol and fos. additionally, supplementation with fos, mannitol and maltodextrin increased  (p < 0.05) the production of lactic acid. supplementation with fos and maltodextrin also increased the alpha-galactosidase activity of probiotics, leading to enhanced hydrolysis and utilisation of soy oligosaccharides. finally,  prebiotic supplementation enhanced the utilisation of simpler sugars such as fructose and glucose in soymilk. conclusion: supplementation with prebiotics enhances the potential of soymilk as a carrier for probiotics.

TI  == angiotensin i-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and bioconversion of isoflavones by probiotics in soymilk supplemented with prebiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. ftdc 2113, l. acidophilus ftdc 8033, l. acidophilus atcc 4356,  l. casei atcc 393, bifidobacterium ftdc 8943 and b. longum ftdc 8643 were incorporated into soymilk supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (fos), inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin. the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of prebiotics on the bioactivity of probiotic-fermented soymilk. proteolytic activity was increased in the presence of fos, while the supplementation of inulin and pectin increased the angiotensin i-converting enzyme inhibitory activity accompanied by lower ic(50) values. the beta-glucosidase activity was also enhanced in the presence of pectin. this led to higher bioconversion of glucosides to aglycones by probiotics, especially genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. results from this study indicated that the supplementation of prebiotics enhanced the in-vitro antihypertensive effect and production of bioactive aglycones in probiotic-fermented soymilk. therefore, this soymilk could potentially be used as a dietary therapy to reduce  the risks of hypertension and hormone-dependent diseases such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and osteoporosis.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == probiotic cheddar cheese: influence of ripening temperatures on proteolysis and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheeses.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum 1941, b. animalis subsp. lactis lafti b94, lactobacillus casei 279, lb. casei lafti l26, lb. acidophilus 4962, or lb. acidophilus lafti l10 were used as an adjunct in the production of cheddar cheeses, which were ripened at 4 and 8 degrees c for 24 wk. effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of cheddar cheeses. there were positive and  significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic,  and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-cn and beta-cn to the scores of cheddary flavor (p < 0.05). scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of bifidobacterium sp. or lb. casei 279  ripened at 8 degrees c. the scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (p < 0.05). the results show that both 4 and 8 degrees c have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic cheddar cheeses.

TI  == probiotic potential of noni juice fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == the present study assesses the feasibility of noni as a raw substrate for the production of probiotic noni juice by lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilluscasei and lactobacillus plantarum) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacteriumlongum). changes  in ph, acidity, sugar content, cell survival and antioxidant properties during fermentation were monitored. all tested strains grew well on noni juice, reaching nearly 10(9) colony-forming units/ml after 48 h fermentation. l.casei produced less lactic acid than b.longum and l. plantarum. after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees c, b.longum and l. plantarum survived under low-ph conditions in fermented noni juice. in contrast, l.casei exhibited no cell viability after 3 weeks. moreover, noni juice fermented with b.longum had a high antioxidant capacity that did not differ significantly (p <0.05) from that of lactic acid bacteria. finally, we found that b.longum and l. plantarum are optimal probiotics for fermentation with noni juice.

TI  == development and use of tuf gene-based primers for the multiplex pcr detection of  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii,  and bifidobacterium longum in commercial dairy products.
AB  == pcr primers specific for the detection of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and bifidobacterium longum  were designed based on the elongation factor tu gene (tuf). the specificity of these four primer sets were confirmed by pcr with 88 bacterial strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and other bacterial species. results indicated that these primer sets generated predicted pcr products of 397, 230, 202, and 161 bp for l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei group, and b. longum, respectively. bacterial species other than the target organisms tested did not generate false-positive results. when these four primer sets were combined for the simultaneous detection of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) in fermented milk products including yogurt, the lab species listed on the labels of these products could be identified without the preenrichment step. the identification limit for each lab strain with this multiplex pcr method was n x 10(3) cfu/ml in milk samples. the results of our multiplex pcr method were confirmed by pcr assay using primers based on the 16s rdna or the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and by biochemical tests using the api 50 chl kit. when  this multiplex pcr method was used with the determination of counts of total viable lab and bifidobacteria, the quality of commercial fermented milk products  could be assured.

TI  == the effects of probiotics on ppi-triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods:  three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a  triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control  group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however,  by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than  in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events  were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

AB  == probiotics are deliberately ingested preparations of live bacterial species that  confer health benefits on the host. many of these species are associated with the fermentation of dairy products. despite their increasing use, the molecular details of the impact of various probiotic preparations on resident members of the gut microbiota and the host are generally lacking. to address this issue, we  colonized germ-free mice with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent component of the adult human gut microbiota, and bifidobacterium longum, a minor member but a commonly used probiotic. simultaneous whole genome transcriptional profiling of both bacterial species in their gut habitat and of the intestinal epithelium, combined with mass-spectrometric analysis of habitat-associated carbohydrates, revealed that the presence of b. longum elicits an expansion in the diversity of  polysaccharides targeted for degradation by b. thetaiotaomicron (e.g., mannose- and xylose-containing glycans), and induces host genes involved in innate immunity. although the overall transcriptome expressed by b. thetaiotaomicron when it encounters b. longum in the cecum is dependent upon the genetic background of the mouse (as assessed by a mixed analysis of variance [anova] model of co-colonization experiments performed in nmri and c57bl/6j animals), b.  thetaiotaomicron's expanded capacity to utilize polysaccharides occurs independently of host genotype, and is also observed with a fermented dairy product-associated strain, lactobacillus casei. this gnotobiotic mouse model provides a controlled case study of how a resident symbiont and a probiotic species adapt their substrate utilization in response to one another, and illustrates both the generality and specificity of the relationship between a host, a component of its microbiota, and intentionally consumed microbial species.

TI  == vsl#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == immunomodulatory and antitumor effects in vivo by the cytoplasmic fraction of lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == the immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of lactic acid bacteria (labs) were investigated. cytoplasmic fraction of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum were tested for the antiproliferative activity in vitro to snuc2a, snu1, nih/3t3 and jurkat cell lines by crystal violet assay.  all cytoplasmic fraction suppressed proliferation of tumor cells, though l. casei and b. longum were more effective. from these results, cytoplasmic fraction of l. casei and b. longum with y400 as a control were administered as dietary supplements to balb/c mice for 2, and 4 consecutive wks. administration for 4 wks enhanced the number of total t cells, nk cells and mhc class ii+ cells, and cd4-cd8+ t cells in flow cytometry analysis. to determine of antitumor activity of labs preparation in vivo, f9 teratocarcinoma cells were inoculated on mice at  14th day. body weight was decreased with increased survival rate in all groups with the cytoplasm of labs. our results showed that cytoplasmic fraction of labs  had direct antiproliferative effects on tumor cell lines in vitro, effects on immune cells in vivo, and antitumor effects on tumor-bearing mice with prolonged  survival periods.

TI  == effect of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and inulin on the formation of aberrant crypt foci in rats.
AB  == background: our studies were aimed at investigating the effect of lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) or inulin, a natural source of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from chicory, on the induction by carcinogens of aberrant crypt foci (acf) in the colon, which are considered to be early precursor lesions of neoplasia. methods: strains of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were administered to rats fed a purified high starch diet, under a variety of treatment protocols including daily gavage, via the drinking water and in the diet. the rats were treated with methyl-n-nitrosourea, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, or azoxymethane (aom) to induce acf. results: in general, no consistent significant changes in acf numbers were detected in these experiments. in one study, the basal diet of the rats was changed to one containing a higher level of fat (corn oil). under these conditions, a significant decrease in aom-induced colonic acf was seen in rats given l. acidophilus or inulin. in a concurrent group of animals fed a low fat diet, no significant decrease in acf was observed. conclusions: the results indicate that the type of diet fed can influence the detection of protective effects of lab and oligosaccharides and that against the background of a diet with a level of fat typical of a western diet, evidence for a protective effect of l. acidophilus and inulin towards colon cancer was obtained

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == effects of cultured milk products by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species on the secretion of bile acids in hepatocytes and in rats.
AB  == whey preparations prepared from cultured milk by 19 lactobacillus (2 species) and 20 bifidobacterium (5 species) strains were examined for the effects of secretion and synthesis of bile acids in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. the stimulating  effect of whey preparation on bile acid secretion depended on the species as well as the strains used for milk fermentation. two strains belonging to l. casei sbt  2230 (lc2230) and b. longum sbt 2912 (bl2912) produced the whey which stimulates  both the secretion of bile acid and the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis. when the cultured products by these two strains were given to rats for 14 days, the products from l. casei (lc2230) were found to stimulate the biliary secretion of  bile acids. these results suggest that primary cultured hepatocytes were a useful experimental system as an initial screening for an active principle modulating cholesterol metabolism.

AB  == the gene ldh, encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) of bifidobacterium longum am101-2, was cloned in escherichia coli using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide hybridization probe. the amino acid (aa) sequence, deduced from the sequence of the cloned dna, was consistent with the results of protein chemical analysis of b. longum ldh. the transcription start points (tsp)  in b. longum were identified by s1 nuclease mapping. a sequence, gtagcaa-(14 bp)-ttataga, which is located a few bp upstream from the tsp, was assigned as the promoter of this ldh gene. in the 3'-noncoding region, there were two structures  that strongly resembled the rho-independent transcriptional termination signal of e. coli. therefore, the b. longum ldh gene might form a monocistronic unit. the deduced primary structure of b. longum ldh had 40% identity with ldhs from thermus caldophilus, bacillus stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei and dogfish muscle. most bacterial ldhs are allosterically regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), while the vertebrate ldhs are not. the anion-binding site of vertebrate ldhs has been thought to correspond to the fbp-binding site of bacterial ldhs. although the b. longum ldh was regulated by fbp, the charge properties of aa residues in the putative fbp-binding site of the ldh were closer to those of the vertebrate ldhs than to those of bacterial ldhs.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
