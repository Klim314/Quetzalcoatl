[bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
[bilophila wadsworthia isolated from surgical specimens].
bilophila wadsworthia is a recently recognized nonspore-forming anaerobic gram-negative rod and is reported to be associated with various surgical infections. in the present study, the isolation rate of b. wadsworthia from surgical specimens and its antimicrobial susceptibilities were examined. last 5 years, b. wadsworthia was isolated from 46 (5.2%) out of 884 specimens from the surgical abdominal infections. b. wadsworthia was most frequently isolated from secondary peritonitis such as perforated peritonitis, followed by postoperative peritonitis. there is no case of single isolation of b. wadsworthia. the rate of mixed infection with bacteroides spp. (24.8%) was highest, followed by escherichia coli (11.6%) and enterococcus spp. (10.1%). although b. wadsworthia was highly resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin showed strongest activities with mic90 of 1 microg/ml, followed by minocycline and ciprofloxacin with 4micro g/ml, and levofloxacin with 8 microg/ml, respectively.
