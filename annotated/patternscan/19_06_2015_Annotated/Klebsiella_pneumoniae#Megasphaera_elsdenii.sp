TI  == electron-transfer studies involving flavodoxin and a natural redox partner, the iron protein of nitrogenase. conformational constraints on protein-protein interactions and the kinetics of electron transfer within the protein complex.
AB  == the kinetics of electron-transfer reactions involving flavodoxins from klebsiella pneumoniae (kpfld), azotobacter chroococcum (acfld), anacystis nidulans (anfld) and megasphaera elsdenii (mefld), the free, mgadp-bound and mgatp-bound forms of  the fe protein component of nitrogenase from k. pneumoniae [kp2, kp2(mgadp)2 and  kp2(mgatp)2] and na2s2o4 were studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. kinetic  evidence was obtained for the formation of binary protein complexes involving kpfldsq (semiquinone) with either kp2(mgadp)2 (kd = 49 microm) or kp2(mgatp)2 (kd = 13 microm) but not with kp2 (kd greater than 730 microm). the binding of 2mgatp or 2mgadp to kp2 therefore not only shifts the midpoint potential (em) of the [4fe-4s] centre from -200 mv to -320 mv or -350 mv respectively but also changes  the affinity of kp2 for kpfldsq. thermodynamically unfavourable electron from kp2(mgadp)2 and kp2(mgatp)2 to kpfldsq occurs within the protein complexes with k = 1.2 s-1 (delta e = -72 mv) and 0.5 s-1 (delta e = -120 mv) respectively. although acfldsq is reduced by kp2, kp2(mgadp)2 and kp2(mgatp)2 (k = 8 x 10(3), 2.4 x 10(3) and 9 x 10(2) m-1.s-1 respectively), protein-complex formation is weak in each case (kd greater than 700 microm). electron transfer in the physiologically important and thermodynamically favourable direction from kp2fldhq (hydroquinone) and acfldhq to kp2ox.(mgadp)2 (the state of kp2 that accepts electrons from fldhq in the catalytic cycle of nitrogenase) is rapid (k greater than 10(6) m-1.s-1). the second-order rate constants for the reduction of kpfldsq, acfldsq, anfldsq and mefldsq by so2.- (active reductant formed by the predissociation of s2o4(2-) ion) exhibited the linear free-energy relationship predicted by the marcus theory of electron transfer.

TI  == the base sequence of the niff gene of klebsiella pneumoniae and homology of the predicted amino acid sequence of its protein product to other flavodoxins.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 629 base-pair segment of dna spanning the niff gene  of klebsiella pneumoniae is presented. the structural gene comprises 531 base-pairs (175 codons, excluding the translational initiator and terminator) encoding an acidic polypeptide of 18950 da. the niff product thus belongs to the  long-chain class of flavodoxins. it shows some sequence homology to the short-chain flavodoxins from desulfovibrio vulgaris, clostridium mp and megasphaera elsdenii, and much stronger homology to long-chain flavodoxins from azotobacter vinelandii and anacystis nidulans. the long chain flavodoxins thus seem to constitute a well-conserved sub-group. the homology with the a. vinelandii flavodoxin is particularly strong, which may reflect their common function in nitrogen fixation.
