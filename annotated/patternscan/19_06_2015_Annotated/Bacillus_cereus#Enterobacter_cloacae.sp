TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from jatropha dioica roots.
AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant jatropha dioica (euphorbiaceae) were investigated. in order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis and sporothrix schenckii. results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. the activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. the hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines chang, ok and llcpk-1 (ic50>1000 mug ml(-1)).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == control of microorganisms and reduction of biogenic amines in chicken breast and  thigh by irradiation and organic acids.
AB  == the effect of irradiation or organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh meat to control inoculated microorganisms and the production of biogenic amines (ba) was studied. bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and alcaligenes faecalis were selected and inoculated into raw ground chicken breast and thigh meat at approximately 10(7) cfu/g. the samples were irradiated at 0, 0.5, 1, and  2 kgy or mixed with a 0.2 m solution of acetic, citric, or lactic acid (1 ml for  10 g of meat sample) for 24 h at 4 degrees c. viable cell counts and ba contents  were determined. irradiation was effective in reducing the inoculated bacteria: 0.5 kgy achieved approximately a 2-log reduction, and no viable cells were detected at a dose of 2 kgy. in contrast, only up to a 1-log reduction was achieved by organic acid treatment except for citric acid, which achieved approximately a 3-log reduction of e. cloacae. both the irradiation and organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh reduced the ba content, but the rate of ba reduction differed by inoculated organism and treatment (irradiation or organic acid). although irradiation was an excellent method for controlling inoculated microorganisms, the content of ba produced was similar to that of the  organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh meat.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant for high-throughput screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. this paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (e166cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the bacillus cereus beta-lactamase i (penpc), b. cereus beta-lactamase  ii, bacillus licheniformis penp, escherichia coli tem-1, and enterobacter cloacae p99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. the e166cf mutant was constructed by replacing glu166 on the flexible omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine  residue on a class a beta-lactamase (b. cereus penpc) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the e166cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. the fluorescence intensity of the e166cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. for antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the e166cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. for antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the e166cf mutant (penicillin g, penicillin v, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. the e166cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. in contrast,  in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the e166cf mutant were decreased. the fluorescence signals from the e166cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation  of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates.  this simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamase generated from beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the resistance of bacteria to the normally lethal action of beta-lactam antibiotics is largely due to the production of beta-lactamases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam. one class of these enzymes is a zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamase for which there are no clinically available inhibitors. the hydrolysis of cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotics generates dihydrothiazines which subsequently undergo isomerization at c6 by c-s bond cleavage and through the intermediacy of a thiol. these thiols can be trapped by  the beta-lactamase from bacillus cereus, causing inhibition of the enzyme. the rate of production of the thiol corresponds to the rate of inhibition, and the inhibition constants are in the micromolar range but vary with the nature of the  cephalosporin derivative. nmr studies have identified the structure of the thiols causing inhibition and also show that the thiol binds to the zinc ion, which in turn perturbs the metal-bound histidines. inhibition is slowly removed as the thiol becomes oxidized or undergoes further degradation. the thiol intermediate generated from cephalothin is a slow binding inhibitor. there is no observed inhibition from the analogous degradation products from penicillins.

TI  == practical application of dynamic temperature profiles to estimate the parameters  of the square root model.
AB  == optimal experimental design for parameter estimation (oed/pe) is a promising method to improve parameter estimation accuracy and minimise experimental effort  in the field of predictive microbiology. in this paper, the oed/pe methodology was applied on two practical examples: the growth of bacillus cereus and enterobacter cloacae in liquid whole egg product. both strains were recovered from samples of a commercial product. the goal of the modelling exercise was to quantify the influence of temperature on bacterial growth. the baranyi-model for  bacterial growth combined with the ratkowsky square root model to describe temperature dependence was used. using this model, a temperature step profile was calculated based on the optimal d-criterion. the model was then fitted against the experimental bacterial growth curve measured under the dynamic temperature conditions. this process was repeated until the parameters could be estimated with sufficient accuracy, apparent by the model prediction errors. for b. cereus, prior information could be extracted from the literature, allowing calculating a  dynamic temperature profile directly. two-step profiles were sufficient to obtain a good estimation for the model parameters. no prior information could be found for e. cloacae. therefore, a limited series of static experiments had to be conducted to obtain usable prior model parameters estimates. only one dynamic experiment was then needed to achieve a good estimation.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

AB  == a detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, lek 156 and lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidases (dd-peptidases) is presented. both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the enterobacter cloacae 908r beta-lactamase,  which is usually resistant to inhibition. preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class c beta-lactamases (act-1, cmy-1, and mir-1) are also inactivated. with the e. cloacae 908r enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/k', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. accordingly, lek  157 significantly decreases the mic of ampicillin for e. cloacae p99, a constitutive class c beta-lactamase overproducer. with the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the tem-1 class a enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the oxa-10 class d enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the nmca class a beta-lactamase). by contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class b). the streptomyces sp. strain r61 and k15 extracellular dd-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae).
AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. the ph decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the od of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. the counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. the antimicrobial activity of kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. staphylococcus aureus, shigella sonnei, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, helicobacterpylori, and listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to kombucha. according to the literature on kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and  this is also valid in the present study. however, in this study, kombucha proved  to exert antimicrobial activities against e. coli, sh. sonnei, sal. typhimurium,  sal. enteritidis, and cm. jejuni, even at neutral ph and after thermal denaturation. this finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in kombucha.

TI  == carbapenem derivatives as potential inhibitors of various beta-lactamases, including class b metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == a variety of 1beta-methylcarbapenem derivatives were screened to identify inhibitors of imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase, a class b beta-lactamase, in an automated microassay system using nitrocefin as a substrate. the structure-inhibitory-activity relationship study revealed that three types of 1beta-methylcarbapenems having benzothienylthio, dithiocarbamate, or pyrrolidinylthio moieties at the c-2 position showed good inhibitory activity. among the compounds screened, j-110,441, having a benzothienylthio moiety at the  c-2 position of 1beta-methylcarbapenem, was the most potent inhibitor of class b  metallo-beta-lactamases with k(i) values of 0. 0037, 0.23, 1.00, and 0.83 microm  for imp-1 encoded by the bla(imp) gene, ccra from bacteroides fragilis, l1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and type ii from bacillus cereus, respectively. in  a further characterization study, j-110,441 also showed inhibitory activity against tem-type class a serine beta-lactamase and chromosomal class c serine beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae with k(i) values of 2.54 and 0.037 microm, respectively. combining imipenem or ceftazidime with j-110,441 had a synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. against the isolates of imp-1-producing serratia marcescens, the mics of imipenem decreased to levels ranging from 1/64 to 1/4 in the presence of one-fourth of the mic of j-110,441. against e. cloacae producing high levels of class c beta-lactamase, the mic of ceftazidime decreased from 64 to 4 microg/ml in the presence of 4 microg of j-110,441 per ml. this is the first report to describe a new class of inhibitor of class b and class c beta-lactamases including transferable imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects on beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  == beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the steady-state kinetic parameters v/k and v for turnover of a depsipeptide  substrate, m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]-oxy]benzoic acid, and of a beta-lactam substrate, penicillanic acid, by three typical class a beta-lactamases and a class c beta-lactamase. the isotope effects on alkaline hydrolysis of these substrates have been used as a frame of reference. the effect of the transition state conformation of the substrates in determining the beta-secondary isotope effects has been explicitly considered. the inverse beta-secondary isotope effects on both v/k and v for the class a enzymes with both substrates indicate transition states where the carbonyl group of the scissile bond has become tetrahedral and therefore reflect typical acyl-transfer transition states. the solvent isotope effects indicate that enzyme deacylation (as reflected in v for the staphylococcus aureus pc1 beta-lactamase) may be a classical general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis but that there is little proton motion in the enzyme acylation transition state (as revealed by v/k) for the tem beta-lactamase and bacillus cereus beta-lactamase i. these results provide kinetic support for the conjecture made on structural grounds that class a beta-lactamases employ an  asymmetric double-displacement mechanism. the isotope effects on v/k for the class c beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae p99 suggest an acyl-transfer transition state for the penicillin, although, as for the class a enzymes, without significant proton motion. on the other hand, the v/k transition state for depsipeptide does not seem to involve covalent chemistry. suggestive of this  conclusion are the measured beta-secondary isotope effect of 1,002 +/- 0.012 and  the inverse solvent isotope effect. these results provide an example of a significant difference between the kinetics of turnover of a beta-lactam and a depsipeptide by a beta-lactamase. the v transition state for both substrates with the p99 beta-lactamase probably involves acyl-transfer (deacylation) where the conformation of the acyl-enzyme is closely restricted. the conformations of acyl-enzymes of the pc1 and p99 beta-lactamases correlate to the (different) dispositions of general base catalysts at their active sites.

AB  == the synthesis of a series of cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives that differ with respect to the substituent at position 7 of the cephem nucleus is described. these compounds are designed as prodrugs of doxorubicin for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates. the key step in the synthesis of this series of compounds involves the use of the phenylacetamido group as an enzymatically removable protecting group for the 7-amino group on the cephem. in  vitro cytotoxicity assays with h2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives were all less toxic than the released drug. prodrugs containing negatively charged groups in the side chain, such as the delta-carboxybutanamido derivative 4 and the alpha-sulfophenylacetyl derivative 5, displayed the least cytotoxic activity and were 46- and 26-fold less toxic than doxorubicin, respectively. the efficiency of activation of all the prodrugs  was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays on h2981 cells with the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae p99, escherichia coli tem-1, and bacillus cereus (type ii).  in general, the e. cloacae enzyme was found to most rapidly activate the majority of these prodrugs. phenylacetamido prodrug 2 and delta-carboxybutanamido prodrug  4 were both activated in an immunospecific manner by l6-e. cloacae beta-lactamase, a monoclonal antibody conjugate that binds to receptors on h2981  lung adenocarcinoma cells.

TI  == kinetic and physical studies of beta-lactamase inhibition by a novel penem, brl 42715.
AB  == the interactions of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus i, tem, klebsiella pneumoniae k1 and enterobacter cloacae p99 beta-lactamases with the novel penem inhibitor brl 42715 were investigated kinetically and, in some cases, by electrospray mass spectrometry (e.s.m.s.). all the beta-lactamases were rapidly inactivated by brl 42715, with second-order rate constants ranging from 0.17 to 6.4 microm-1.s-1. the initial stoichiometry of beta-lactamase inhibition was essentially 1:1, with the exception of the k1 enzyme. in this instance about 20 molecules of brl 42715 were hydrolysed before the enzyme was completely inhibited. inhibited beta-lactamases did not readily regain activity in the absence of brl 42715, the half-lives for regeneration of free enzyme ranging from 5 min for the k1 beta-lactamase to over 2 days for the staphylococcal enzyme. recovery of activity was incomplete for tem-1, k1 and p99 beta-lactamases, suggesting partitioning of the inhibited enzymes to give a permanently (or at least very stable) inactivated species. examination of the interactions of the penem with tem, b. cereus i and p99 beta-lactamases by e.s.m.s. also showed rapid and stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor. in all cases a mass increase of 264  da over the native enzyme was observed, corresponding to the molecular mass of brl 42715, showing that no fragmentation of the penem occurred on reaction with the beta-lactamases.

TI  == antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  == 7-(phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (cm) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (ccm) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. both cm and ccm were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from escherichia coli (ec beta l), bacillus cereus (bc beta l), and enterobacter cloacae (ecl beta l). this resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (pdm), a potent cytotoxic drug. the km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ecl beta l effected the hydrolysis of cm and ccm more rapidly than the other enzymes. conjugates of ecl beta l were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted f(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies  l6 and p1.17 to ecl beta l that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. in vitro experiments indicated that ccm (ic50 = 25-45 microm) was less toxic than pdm (ic50 = 1.5 microm) to h2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (l6 antigen positive,  p1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with l6-ecl beta l. in vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that ccm was less toxic than cm, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than pdm. neither ccm nor pdm exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous h2981 tumors in vivo. however, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received l6-ecl beta l 96 h prior to the administration of  ccm. the effect was immunologically specific (p < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate p1.17-ecl beta l prior to ccm.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, strain nor-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pi) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain e. cloacae nor-1; the higher pi corresponded to ampc cephalosporinase. plasmid dna was not detected in e. cloacae nor-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into escherichia coli jm109. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pacyc184. one recombinant plasmid, pptn1, harbored a 5.3-kb sau3a fragment from e. cloacae nor-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. this enzyme (pi 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of zncl2. its relative molecular mass was 30,000 da. induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. subcloning experiments with hindiii partial digests of pptn1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pptn2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pptn1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb hindiii fragment from pptn2 failed to determine any homology with ampc of e. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family enterobacteriaceae (bla(tem-1)) and bla(shv-3) derivatives), and with previously  described carbapenemase genes such as those from xanthomonas maltophilia, bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis (cfia), and aeromonas hydrophila (cpha). this work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from e. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. this is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the activity of beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus ula-27 on ceftriaxone,  a widely recognized third-generation cephalosporin, has been examined and compared to the activity of various other beta-lactamases from different sources. ceftriaxone (roche s.p.a. milan) was found to be resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and bacillus cereus, but susceptible to beta-lactamases from mycobacterium fortuitum strain cow 18 and, mostly, to beta-lactamases from various strains of citrobacter diversus. derivatives with substituents in the 3-position of ceftriaxone, namely cefotaxime (roussel maestretti s.p.a., milan) and ceftizoxime (farmitalia carlo erba, milan), were much less susceptible to hydrolysis by c. diversus ula-27 enzymes (22 and 6% of ceftriaxone hydrolysis, respectively), the hydrolysis rate being paralleled by differences in mic values. ceftriaxone inhibited the activity of e. cloacae beta-lactamases toward cefazolin as substrate, but the inhibition was totally abolished by preincubation of ceftriaxone with the enzyme before addition of the  substrate. overall, the data point to a relevance of c. diversus ula-27 beta-lactamases in the mechanism of resistance of this strain to the various third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == the cryoenzymology of several different beta-lactamases has been investigated. particular attention has been paid to the experimental pitfalls of the technique. these include such factors as false bursts at the start of the reaction, instability of the enzymes during turnover, and km values so high that little of  the enzyme is present as a complex. many of the difficulties in cryoenzymology stem from the use of organic cryosolvents. a novel "salt" cryosolvent has been tested: ammonium acetate solutions can be used down to about -60 degrees c. the enzymes examined are readily soluble, and stable, in this solvent. nevertheless,  out of 17 beta-lactamase beta-lactam systems, only 4 proved suitable for detailed investigation. in two of these, the hydrolysis of nitrocefin or 7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-[[2-[[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]pyridinio]-methyl]cephem-4-carboxylic acid (padac), by  beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus, substrate was converted into product at a  slow enough rate (at -60 or -55 degrees c, respectively) for it to be possible to do successive scans during the course of the reaction. the spectra were those of  substrate and product, and no intermediate was detected. the results argue against the accumulation of intermediate acyl-enzyme. the hydrolysis of padac by  the p99 beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae again showed spectra characteristic of substrate and product, and there was, moreover, a break in the  arrhenius plot; it is possible that a conformational change is (at least partially) rate-determining. the hydrolysis of dinitrophenylpenicillin by the p99 beta-lactamase did show features suggesting the accumulation of acyl-enzyme.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == kinetics and mechanism of the serine beta-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of depsipeptides.
AB  == steady-state kinetic parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of a series of acyclic depsipeptides (ester analogues of acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine peptides) catalyzed by representative class c (enterobacter cloacae p99) and class a (bacillus cereus i, tem-2, and staphylococcus aureus pc1) beta-lactamases. the best of these substrates, and the one most used in this work, was m-[[(phenylacetyl)-glycyl]oxy]benzoic acid, whose rates of cleavage could be followed spectrophotometrically. the p99 enzyme also catalyzed the methanolysis of these substrates in aqueous methanol solutions. quantitative evaluation of the effects of methanol on the kinetics of the competing hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions, and on the product distribution, supports a reaction  mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate whose formation is rate-determining under conditions of substrate saturation. consideration of the variation of these kinetic parameters with the structure of the depsipeptides and comparison with the analogous parameters for bicyclic beta-lactam substrates suggest that a variety of substrate binding modes exist on this enzyme. the class a enzymes, b. cereus beta-lactamase i and the tem-2 beta-lactamase, catalyze depsipeptide and benzylpenicillin hydrolyses but not methanolysis. the acyl-enzyme derived from both types of substrate is thus shielded from external nucleophiles; the shielding is therefore not an effect, direct or indirect, of the thiazolidinyl group in the penicilloyl-enzyme. the class a beta-lactamase of  the pc1 plasmid of s. aureus is distinctly different from the above two representatives of that class, in that it does catalyze methanolysis of depsipeptides (but not of benzylpenicillin). the methanolysis kinetics suggest that deacylation is rate-determining at saturation, a conclusion supported by the demonstration of an intermediate during the hydrolysis of m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]oxy]benzoate, subsequent to leaving-group departure. the beta-lactamases have thus been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of specific depsipeptides with comparable facility to that demonstrated by d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases. the former enzymes, however, differ in being unable to cleave the analogous peptides.

TI  == carboxy groups as essential residues in beta-lactamases.
AB  == beta-lactamases are divided into classes a, b and c on the basis of their amino acid sequences. beta-lactamases were incubated at ph 4.0 with the carboxy-group reagent 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodi-imide plus a coloured nucleophile and the extents of inactivation and nucleophile incorporation were monitored. two class a enzymes (from bacillus cereus and bacillus licheniformis)  and two class c enzymes (from enterobacter cloacae p99 and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were examined. all four enzymes were inactivated, with total inactivation corresponding to the incorporation of approx. 2-3 mol of nucleophile/mol of enzyme. in the case of beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus,  some 53% of the incorporated nucleophile was located on glutamic acid-168 in the  amino acid sequence.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == the growth and respiration of bacterial colonies.
AB  == young colonies of two swarming organisms, bacillus subtilis and proteus vulgaris, grew about as quickly on solid media as in liquid culture whilst four non-swarming organisms, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus albus, all grew slower on solid than in liquid media. oxygen uptake by young colonies of b. subtilis, followed manometrically, increased exponentially at about the same rate as unrestricted aerobic growth. all other colonies demonstrated accelerating respiration which was either not strictly exponential or, in the case of s. albus, definitely biphasic, with a fast then a  slow exponential rate of increase. actual and potential respiration was determined for each species by measuring oxygen uptake before and after resuspending the colony in liquid medium. the ratio of actual to potential respiration was largest in the flat, spreading b. subtilis and smallest in the small, hemispherical s. albus. calculations suggest that oxygen penetrates between 31 and 41 micron into colonies of b. cereus, ent. cloacae and e. coli and only 9 micron into colonies of s. albus.
