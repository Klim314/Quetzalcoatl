TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == [investigation of the presence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) by pcr in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in  southern china.
AB  == non-duplicate multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from january 2008 to december 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as  well as characterisation of gene cassettes. among 825 strains carrying the class  1 integrase gene inti1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and dna sequencing analyses. in addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in escherichia coli, six in klebsiella pneumoniae, six in enterobacter cloacae, three in enterobacter aerogenes, one in  proteus mirabilis, one in acinetobacter spp., one in stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in pseudomonas putida. among them, three cassettes, including had-like, deltamfs-1 and qnrvc-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.

TI  == construction of two lux-tagged hg2+-specific biosensors and their luminescence performance.
AB  == two hg2+-specific biosensors were constructed using bacterial luciferase as reporter gene and plasmid-free pseudomonas putida x4 and enterobacter aerogenes ntg-01 as host strains. the performance of x4 biosensor was compared with that of ntg-01 biosensor in the same assay conditions. the maximum bioluminescence for x4 (pmerrluxcdabe-kan) biosensor was found during the midexponential phase and that  for ntg-01 (pmerrluxcdabe-kan) was at the late exponential phase. the shortest induction time of two biosensors was 30 min. the maximum light signal output for  ntg-01 and x4 sensors was observed at the incubation time of 5 and 4 h, respectively. the lowest detectable concentration of mercury by the two biosensors were both of 100 pm at 28 degrees c, ph 7 and an initial cell number of 10(6) cfu ml(-1). cd2+, zn2+, co2+, cu2+, and pb2 + ions at nanomolar level did not interfere with the measurement by the biosensors. these results show that the sensitivity of the two biosensors is sufficient for the detection of hg2+ under most contaminated environments.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == protistan grazing analysis by flow cytometry using prey labeled by in vivo expression of fluorescent proteins.
AB  == selective grazing by protists can profoundly influence bacterial community structure, and yet direct, quantitative observation of grazing selectivity has been difficult to achieve. in this investigation, flow cytometry was used to study grazing by the marine heterotrophic flagellate paraphysomonas imperforata on live bacterial cells genetically modified to express the fluorescent protein markers green fluorescent protein (gfp) and red fluorescent protein (rfp). broad-host-range plasmids were constructed that express fluorescent proteins in three bacterial prey species, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas putida. micromonas pusilla, an alga with red autofluorescence, was also used as prey. predator-prey interactions were quantified by using a facscan  flow cytometer and analyzed by using a perl program described here. grazing preference of p. imperforata was influenced by prey type, size, and condition. in competitive feeding trials, p. imperforata consumed algal prey at significantly lower rates than fp (fluorescent protein)-labeled bacteria of similar or different size. within-species size selection was also observed, but only for p.  putida, the largest prey species examined; smaller cells of p. putida were grazed preferentially. no significant difference in clearance rate was observed between  gfp- and rfp-labeled strains of the same prey species or between wild-type and gfp-labeled strains. in contrast, the common chemical staining method, 5-(4,6-dichloro-triazin-2-yl)-amino fluorescein hydrochloride, depressed clearance rates for bacterial prey compared to unlabeled or rfp-labeled cells.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == biosynthesis of pyridoxine in saccharomyces cerevisiae--origin of the pyridoxine  nitrogen atom differs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
AB  == the amide nitrogen atom of glutamine is incorporated into pyridoxine in four eukaryotes (i.e., emericella nidulans, mucor racemosus, neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and two prokaryotes (i.e., staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis). however, in the prokaryotes pseudomonas putida, enterobacter  aerogenes and escherichia coli, it is the nitrogen atom of glutamate that is incorporated into pyridoxine (j nutr sci vitaminol (2000) 46, 55-57). as these results were from experiments conducted under aerobic conditions, we investigated the biosynthesis of pyridoxine on s. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. the results showed that [amide-15n]l-glutamine was not incorporated into pyridoxine,  unlike the results for aerobic conditions. the incorporation of [15n]ammonium salts into pyridoxine was not inhibited in the presence of casamino acids and tryptophan. the results showed that the nitrogen atoms of amino acids are not used for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. the incorporation of 15n into pyridoxine was inhibited in the presence of adenine, but not in that of hypoxanthine. thus,  the nitrogen atom of pyridoxine may be from the amino group attached to the c-6 of adenine.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

AB  == a strain of pseudomonas putida that utilized the biogenic organophosphonate 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole carbon and energy, nitrogen and phosphorus source contained 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid: pyruvate aminotransferase and phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) activities which were inducible by the presence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid in the culture medium, regardless  of the phosphate status of the cells. neither of these activities were induced in their phosphate-free or phosphate-replete medium in the absence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. alkaline phosphatase activity was induced in phosphate limited medium, however, indicating a phosphate-starvation inducible response. in enterobacter aerogenes ifo 12010, 2-aminoethylphosphonate: pyruvate  aminotransferase and phosphonatase activities were induced only when cells were both phosphate limited and supplied with 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole phosphorus source for growth. neither enzyme activity was induced in phosphate-replete medium, or in medium where both 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid and inorganic phosphate were supplied as sources of phosphorus. the results point to  the presence of a substrate inducible 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid biodegradation  pathway in the isolated strain of pseudomonas putida. uniquely, therefore, the pathway is not under pho regulon control in this strain.

TI  == novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in pseudomonas.
AB  == novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. we found that a new pseudomonas strain, pseudomonas flavida if-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pni10 and pni20. they were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pni10 and 2.9 kb for pni20. several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (kmr or smr) gene were constructed from pni10 and pni20. these plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid dna by the usual  competent cell method. the vectors derived from pni10 replicated not only in pseudomonas but also in some other gram-negative enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis.

AB  == introduction: the efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin were compared with those  of vancomycin/polymyxin for prophylaxis of bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients undergoing chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. patients and methods: antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. results: in the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. however, except for a reduction of staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with  viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. conclusion: these results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. more effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == biosynthesis of thiamin. different biosynthetic routes of the thiazole moiety of  thiamin in aerobic organisms and anaerobic organisms.
AB  == the nitrogen atom of glycine was incorporated into the thiazole moiety of thiamin in the aerobic microorganisms bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, saccharomyces cerevisiae, mucor racemosus, neurospora crassa, and emericella nidulans. it was not incorporated in the case of the facultative anaerobic microorganisms escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes, which, however, did incorporate the nitrogen atom of tyrosine. these results show that aerobic microorganisms and facultative anaerobic microorganisms have different biosynthetic pathways for the thiazole moiety of thiamin.

TI  == measuring the spermosphere colonizing capacity (spermosphere competence) of bacterial inoculants.
AB  == spermosphere establishment by bacteria which were coated onto seeds was studied using soybean seeds treated with four bacterial strains at levels of log10 1 to 4 colony-forming units (cfu) per seed planted in a field soil mix, and incubated 48 h. each strain at every inoculum level developed spermosphere population densities of log10 4 to 8 cfu/seed, demonstrating an average multiplication of log10 3 cfu/seed. an alternative method was developed to differentially rank bacteria for spermosphere colonizing capacity, based upon incorporation of bacteria into a soil and monitoring the resulting spermosphere population densities around noninoculated seeds after 4 days at 14 degrees c. fifty-seven bacterial strains which were isolated from soybean roots or from water samples, including pseudomonas putida, p. putida biovar b, p. fluorescens, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacillus spp. were tested in the spermosphere colonization assay. average spermosphere population densities for the 57 strains ranged from 0 to log10 7.0 cfu/seed. strains of a given taxon demonstrated marked diversity with ranges from 0 to log10 6.0 cfu/seed for bacillus spp. and from log10 1.4 to 7.0 cfu/seed for pseudomonas putida. the relative ranking of representative strains was consistent in repeating experiments. the potential usefulness of the assay for efforts to develop competitive bacterial inoculants for crop seeds is discussed.
