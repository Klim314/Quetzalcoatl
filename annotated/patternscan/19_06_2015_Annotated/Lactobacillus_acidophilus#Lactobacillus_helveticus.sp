TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == cell growth and proteolytic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  == the present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (rsm). changes in ph, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of rsm by pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. the study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in  rsm. all bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in rsm supplemented with large peptides (>10 kda), and l. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. the ace-inhibitory activity was  observed to be the maximum in rsm supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kda) for all bacteria. the results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ace-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.

TI  == differential effects of lactobacilli on activation and maturation of mouse dendritic cells.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are of interest because of their potential to modulate immune responses. the effects of lab range from regulation to stimulation of the  immune system. a series of studies were performed in vitro to study the effects of six lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus helveticus lh-2, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, la-115, la-116 and la-14, and lactobacillus salivarius, on maturation and activation of mouse dendritic cells. production of tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-?, interleukin (il)-6 and il-10 by dendritic cells (dcs) was determined after treating cells with live lab. the expression of dc maturation markers, cd80 and cd40, was also measured using flow cytometry after stimulation  with lab. in addition, the expression of toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2, 4 and 9 by dcs stimulated with lab was measured. our results revealed that lab act differentially on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and  induction of co-stimulatory molecules by dcs. specifically, l. salivarius was found to be the most effective lab to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. moreover, la-14, la-116 and la-5 induced moderate maturation and activation of dcs. on the other hand, lh-2 and la-115 were the least effective lactobacilli to induce dc responses. the present  study also revealed that l. salivarius was able to induce the expression of tlr2, 4 and 9 by dcs. in conclusion, various strains and species of lab can differentially regulate dc activation and maturation, providing further evidence  that these bacteria may have the ability to influence and steer immune responses  in vivo.

TI  == characterization of surface layer proteins and its role in probiotic properties of three lactobacillus strains.
AB  == the objective of this study was the characterization of the surface layer proteins (slps) and their functional role in the probiotic activity of lactobacillus helveticus fb213, l. acidophilus fb116 and l. acidophilus fb214. slps were extracted and identified by sds-page, circular dichroism spectra and lc-ms analysis. the results revealed that the molecular masses of the three proteins were 49.7 kda, 46.0 kda and 44.6 kda, respectively. the secondary structures and amino acid compositions of the three proteins were found to be similar. after removing slps, the survival of the three lactobacilli in simulated gastric and intestinal juices was reduced by 2-3log as compared with survival of  the intact cells. and the adhesion ability of the three strains to ht-29 cells decreased by 61%, 65% and 92%, respectively. slps also inhibited the adhesion and invasion of escherichia coli atcc 43893 to ht-29 cells. these results suggest that slps are advantageous barriers for lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract, and these proteins help make it possible for lactobacilli to serve their probiotic functions.

TI  == the structure and immunomodulatory activity on intestinal epithelial cells of the epss isolated from lactobacillus helveticus sp. rosyjski and lactobacillus acidophilus sp. 5e2.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria (lab) lactobacillus acidophilus sp. 5e2 and lactobacillus helveticus sp. rosyjski both secrete exopolysaccharides (epss) into their surrounding environments during growth. a number of epss have previously been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory activity with professional immune cells, such as macrophages, but only limited studies have been reported of their interaction with intestinal epithelial cells. an investigation of the immunomodulatory potential of pure epss, isolated from cultures of lactobacillus  acidophilus sp. 5e2 and lactobacillus helveticus sp. rosyjski, with the ht29-19a  intestinal epithelial cell line are reported here. for the first time the structure of the eps from lactobacillus helveticus sp. rosyjski which is a hetropolysaccharide with a branched pentasaccharide repeat unit containing d-glucose, d-galactose and n-acetyl-d-mannosamine is described. in response to exposure to lactobacilli epss ht29-19a cells produce significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine il-8. additionally, the epss differentially modulate the mrna expression of toll-like receptors. finally, the  pre-treatment of ht29-19a cells with the epss sensitises the cells to subsequent  challenge with bacterial antigens. the results reported here suggest that epss could potentially play a role in intestinal homeostasis via a specific interaction with intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == peptidoglycan hydrolases as species-specific markers to differentiate lactobacillus helveticus from lactobacillus gallinarum and other closely related  homofermentative lactobacilli.
AB  == we propose a new method that allows accurate discrimination of lactobacillus helveticus from other closely related homofermentative lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus gallinarum. this method is based on the amplification by pcr of two peptidoglycan hydrolytic genes, lhv_0190 and lhv_0191. these genes are ubiquitous and show high homology at the intra-species level. the pcr method gave two specific pcr products, of 542 and 747 bp, for 25 l. helveticus strains coming from various sources. for l. gallinarum, two amplicons were obtained, the specific 542 bp amplicon and another one with a size greater than 1,500 bp. no specific pcr products were obtained for 12 other closely related species of lactobacilli, including the l. acidophilus complex, l. delbrueckii, and l. ultunensis. the developed pcr method provided rapid, precise, and easy identification of l. helveticus. moreover, it enabled differentiation between the two closely phylogenetically related species l. helveticus and l. gallinarum.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. methods and results: to fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time pcr assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate  identification and quantification of five commercially important lactobacillus species. the developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of  the species lact. acidophilus, lact. brevis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. conclusions: with the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) cfu ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) cfu ml(-1) of probiotic strains. significance and impact of the study: the real-time pcr assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.

TI  == [system analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  == a perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, l. helveticus (strains of dsm), out of which, as known, drug hylak forte is made. our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. in the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of  the effects of vitamins b2, b6 and k on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. the results of the analysis allow us clarify  the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin b6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (fad, a derivative of vitamin b2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (nad, a derivative of vitamin b3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. the proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.

TI  == diversity in proteinase specificity of thermophilic lactobacilli as revealed by hydrolysis of dairy and vegetable proteins.
AB  == ability of industrially relevant species of thermophilic lactobacilli strains to  hydrolyze proteins from animal (caseins and beta-lactoglobulin) and vegetable (soybean and wheat) sources, as well as influence of peptide content of growth medium on cell envelope-associated proteinase (cep) activity, was evaluated. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (crl 581 and 654), l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus (crl 454 and 656), lactobacillus acidophilus (crl 636 and 1063), and lactobacillus helveticus (crl 1062 and 1177) were grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented or not with 1 % casitone. all strains hydrolyzed mainly beta-casein, while degradation of alphas-caseins was strain dependent. contrariwise, kappa-casein was poorly degraded by the studied lactobacilli. beta-lactoglobulin was mainly hydrolyzed by crl 656, crl 636, and crl 1062 strains. the l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656, and l. helveticus crl 1177 degraded gliadins in high extent,  while the l. acidophilus and l. helveticus strains highly hydrolyzed soy proteins. proteinase production was inhibited by casitone, the most affected being the l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis species. this study highlights the importance of proteolytic diversity of lactobacilli for rational strain selection when formulating hydrolyzed dairy or vegetable food products.

TI  == hypolipidemic effects of lactic acid bacteria fermented cereal in rats.
AB  == background: the objectives of the present study were to investigate the efficacy  of the mixed culture of lactobacillus acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lactobacillus helveticus (ck60) in the fermentation of maize and the evaluation of the effect of the fermented meal on the lipid profile of rats. methods: rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and each group placed on a diet a (high fat diet into which a maize meal fermented with a mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) was incorporated), b (unfermented high fat diet) or c (commercial rat chow) respectively after the first group of 7 rats randomly selected were sacrificed to obtain the baseline data. thereafter 7 rats each from the experimental and control groups were sacrificed weekly for 4 weeks and the plasma, erythrocytes, lipoproteins and organs of the rats were assessed for cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. results: our results revealed that the mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) were able to grow and ferment maize meal into 'ogi' of acceptable flavour. in addition to plasma and hepatic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, phospholipidosis in plasma, as well as cholesterogenesis, triglyceride constipation and phospholipidosis in extra-hepatic tissues characterized the consumption of unfermented hyperlipidemic diets. however, feeding the animals with the fermented maize diet reversed the dyslipidemia. conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that consumption of mixed culture lactic acid bacteria (lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) fermented food results in the inhibition of fat absorption. it also inhibits the activity of hmg coa reductase. this inhibition may be by feedback inhibition or repression of the transcription of the gene encoding the enzyme via activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) transcription factor. it is also possible that consumption of fermented food enhances conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by activating cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase.

TI  == evaluation of lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
AB  == eleven strains of lactobacillus collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 for adhesion on caco-2 cells. the viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. all strains showed antimicrobial activity  and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against lactobacillus and clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase k and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. the degree  of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhesion on the surface of caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhering to caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., lactobacillus gasseri ccdm 215, lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 149, and lactobacillus helveticus ccdm 82.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  == five lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains belonging to species lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of dna synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). generally, the lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint  levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the european food safety authority. despite the very similar profile of s. thermophilus lc201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.

TI  == lc-ms/ms analysis of surface layer proteins as a useful method for the identification of lactobacilli from the lactobacillus acidophilus group.
AB  == for precise identification of a lactobacillus k1 isolate, lc-ms/ms analysis of the putative surface layer protein was performed. the results obtained from ltq-ft-icr mass spectrometry confirmed that the analyzed protein spot is the surface layer protein originating from lb. helveticus species. moreover, the identified protein has the highest similarity with the surface layer protein from lb. helveticus r0052. to evaluate the proteomic study, multilocus sequence analysis of selected housekeeping gene sequences was performed. combination of 16s rrna sequencing with partial sequences for the genes encoding the rna polymerase alpha subunit (rpoa), phenylalanyl-trna synthase alpha subunit (phes), translational elongation factor tu (tuf), and hsp60 chaperonins (groel) also allowed to classify the analyzed isolate as lb. helveticus. further classification at the strain level was achieved by sequencing of the slp gene. this gene showed 99.8% identity with the corresponding slp gene of lb. helveticus r0052, which is in good agreement with data obtained by nano-hplc coupled to an ltq-ft-icr mass spectrometer. finally, lc-ms/ ms analysis of surface layer proteins extracted from three other lactobacillus strains proved that the proposed method is the appropriate molecular tool for the identification of s-layer-possessing lactobacilli at the species and even strain levels.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == the effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  == the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lat 187, lactobacillus acidophilus lat 180, lactobacillus helveticus lat 179, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis lat 182, streptococcus thermophilus lat 205 and enterococcus faecium e 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. chickens were divided into three groups (c, control;  e1 and e2, experimental groups). experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. in the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of  probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == comparative genomics of lactic acid bacteria reveals a niche-specific gene set.
AB  == background: the recently sequenced genome of lactobacillus helveticus dpc4571 revealed a dairy organism with significant homology (75% of genes are homologous) to a probiotic bacteria lb. acidophilus ncfm. this led us to hypothesise that a group of genes could be determined which could define an organism's niche. results: taking 11 fully sequenced lactic acid bacteria (lab) as our target, (3 dairy lab, 5 gut lab and 3 multi-niche lab), we demonstrated that the presence or absence of certain genes involved in sugar metabolism, the proteolytic system, and restriction modification enzymes were pivotal in suggesting the niche of a strain. we identified 9 niche specific genes, of which 6 are dairy specific and 3 are gut specific. the dairy specific genes identified in lactobacillus helveticus dpc4571 were lhv_1161 and lhv_1171, encoding components of the proteolytic system, lhv_1031 lhv_1152, lhv_1978 and lhv_0028 encoding restriction endonuclease genes, while bile salt hydrolase genes lba_0892 and lba_1078, and the sugar metabolism gene lba_1689 from lb. acidophilus ncfm were identified as gut specific genes. conclusion: comparative analysis revealed that if an organism had homologs to the dairy specific geneset, it probably came from a dairy environment, whilst if it had homologs to gut specific genes, it was highly likely to be of intestinal origin.we propose that this "barcode" of 9 genes will  be a useful initial guide to researchers in the lab field to indicate an organism's ability to occupy a specific niche.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == influence of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and l. helveticus on proteolysis, organic acid profiles, and ace-inhibitory activity of cheddar cheeses ripened at 4, 8, and 12 degrees c.
AB  == the influence of adjunct bacteria on composition of cheeses, organic acid profiles, proteolysis, and ace-inhibitory activity during ripening at 4, 8, and 12 degrees c for 24 wk was investigated. cheddar cheeses were made with starter lactococci (control), lactobacillus acidophilus l10, and starter lactococci (l10), and l. acidophilus l10, l. helveticus h100, and starter lactococci (h100). the counts of l. acidophilus in l10 cheeses remained at >10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/g after 24 wk of ripening at 4, 8, and 12 degrees c. concentrations of lactic, acetic, and propionic acids of the l10 and h100 cheeses were significantly higher than those of the control cheeses after 24 wk of ripening (p < 0.05). proteolysis of the cheeses was improved as the ripening temperature increased. water-soluble nitrogen, trichloroacetic acid soluble nitrogen, and phosphotungstic acid soluble nitrogen of l10 and h100 cheeses were significantly  higher than those of the control cheeses (p < 0.05). increase in ripening temperature from 4 degrees c to 8 and 12 degrees c increased the percentage of ace inhibition. the ic(50) value among cheeses ripened at 4, 8, and 12 degrees c, however, was not significantly different (p > 0.05). hence, probiotic l. acidophilus l10 can be added into cheddar cheeses to improve proteolysis and ace-inhibitory activity.

TI  == experimental radiotherapy-induced enteritis: a probiotic interventional study.
AB  == objective: acute radiation of the small intestine causes an immediate and potentially reversible effect on the sensitive regenerative epithelium of the intestinal mucosa while markedly altering the overall intestinal ecosystem. the aim of the present study was test a novel probiotic mixture formulation (microflorana-f) in an experimental model of acute radiation enteritis with particular interest in endotoxinemia and bacterial translocation. materials and methods: male wistar rats allocated to three groups were fed for 7 days with: (a) a standard balanced diet; (b) a standard diet with the addition of 1 ml t.i.d. of microflorana-f and (c) the same probiotic but after heat inactivation. under ketamine anesthesia, abdominal irradiation was performed at a single dose rate of 20 gy. sham-radiated healthy rats served as a control (d). standard food and active/inactive probiotic supplementation schedule was maintained throughout the  study period. when they were killed 14 days later a midline laparotomy and a medium sternotomy was carried out. the mesenteric lymph nodes, whole spleen and liver samples as well as blood, the portal vein and bile samples were cultured. endotoxinemia was also measured. results: early deaths (1 week) occurred mostly in rats fed standard food or inactivated probiotic. the endotoxin level significantly increased in irradiated rats fed standard food and inactivated probiotic while supplementation with the active form of the probiotic mixture significantly improved such parameters (p < 0.05). after radiation injury, mesenteric lymph nodes and portal blood were the samples most frequently yielding bacterial growth. treatment with only the active form of probiotic significantly  reduced the incidence of bacterial contamination in all samples. conclusions: these data suggest that the manipulation of gut ecosystem by biologically effective probiotic preparations might be a worthwhile therapeutic and preventive tool in radiation-induced enteritis.

TI  == rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. methods: twenty-six male wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of streptococcus thermophilus e lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. results: malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). conclusion: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.

TI  == use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  == conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (kohonen self organizing map) and  supervised (bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, lactococcus and streptococcus including 47 reference strains. electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by piraino et al. [piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

TI  == lactobacillus suntoryeus cachat and priest 2005 is a later synonym of lactobacillus helveticus (orla-jensen 1919) bergey et al. 1925 (approved lists 1980).
AB  == strain r0052, isolated from a north american dairy starter culture, was initially identified as lactobacillus acidophilus based on phenotypic analyses. however, upon sequencing the 16s rrna gene, it became clear that the isolate was very highly related to lactobacillus suntoryeus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus gallinarum, as similarities ranging from 99.3 to 99.8 % were observed. as an initial screening test to investigate the relatedness of strain r0052 and reference strains of l. suntoryeus, l. helveticus and l. gallinarum, the partial sequences for the genes encoding the alpha subunit of atp synthase (atpa), rna polymerase alpha subunit (rpoa), phenylalanyl-trna synthase alpha subunit (phes), the translational elongation factor tu (tuf), a surface-layer protein (slp) and the hsp60 chaperonins (groel) were determined and they revealed high relatedness between all of the strains. the determination of the 16s-23s rrna internally transcribed spacer (its) sequences revealed 98.3-100% similarity  between l. suntoryeus and l. helveticus strains. sds-page of whole-cell proteins  did not distinguish between these species. fluorescent amplified fragment length  polymorphism (faflp) could distinguish between these taxa, but they still constituted a single cluster within the l. acidophilus group. finally, dna-dna hybridization experiments between strain r0052 and the type strains of l. helveticus and l. suntoryeus yielded reassociation values above 70% and confirmed that these names are synonyms.

TI  == experimental acute alcohol pancreatitis-related liver damage and endotoxemia: synbiotics but not metronidazole have a protective effect.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to test the effect of gut manipulation by either novel synbiotics or by metronidazole on either endotoxemia or the severity of liver damage in the course of acute pancreatitis from alcohol ingestion. methods: sprague-dawley rats were fed for 1 week through an intragastric tube a liquid diet with either: (i) 1 ml t.i.d. of a mixture of synbiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and bifidobacterium in an enriched medium); (ii) 20 mg/kg t.i.d. metronidazole; or (iii) standard diet. then, acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein and when the disease was full-blown, rats were fed an alcohol-rich diet. synbiotic and metronidazole treatment was given for a further 2 weeks. transaminase and endotoxemia levels were measured before treatment, after 6 h, after 24 h and 2 weeks later, at the time the rats were killed. liver samples were obtained for histological analysis. results: synbiotics but not metronidazole improved the acute pancreatitis-induced increase in endotoxemia and transaminase levels. the addition of alcohol worsened these variables to a limited extent in the synbiotic-treated group, while metronidazole had a negative effect on liver damage. conclusions: gut flora pretreatment with synbiotics was able to effectively protect against endotoxin/bacterial translocation, as well as liver damage in the course of acute pancreatitis and concomitant heavy alcohol consumption. the beneficial effect of  synbiotics on liver histology seems to be correlated with endotoxemia. metronidazole did not produce such a beneficial effect; in fact, it further worsened liver damage when alcohol was added to the background of ongoing acute pancreatic inflammation.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and l. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to  these groups was first obtained by pcr amplifications by using group-specific or  species-specific 16s rdna primers. the numerical analysis of the ardra patterns obtained by using cfoi, hinfi, tru9i, and scrfi was an efficient typing tool for  identification of species of the l. acidophilus and l. casei complex. ardra by using cfoi was a reliable method for differentiation of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. finally, strains atcc 393 and atcc 15820 exhibited unique ardra patterns with cfoi and tru9i restriction enzymes as  compared with the other strains of l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

AB  == a 2.6-kilobase haeiii dna fragment corresponding to an extracellular proteinase gene (prty) was cloned from chromosomal dna of lactobacillus helveticus cp790 in  escherichia coli using a pkk223-3 vector. the transformant expressed a 48-kda protein that reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific to the proteinase and seemed to be a pre-proproteinase, but had no proteolytic activity. about 1.6 kilobases of the 2.6-kilobase dna fragment, which contained the complete gene for the proteinase was sequenced. sequence analysis found an open reading frame with  a capacity to encode a protein of 449 amino acids. the coding region contained a  gram-positive-type signal peptide of 30 amino acids. the n-terminal sequences of  the proproteinase and the mature proteinase have been observed in the polypeptide at position + 31 and + 38. the putative amino acid sequence showed a significant  similarity to a surface layer protein of l. helveticus and lactobacillus acidophilus in the amino terminal signal sequence and carboxyl terminus.

TI  == a polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  == a set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the lactobacillus acidophilus rrna-group have been analysed by sds-page of cellular proteins, rapd-pcr and aflp with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. gallinarum, l. helveticus, l. iners and l. amylolyticus. although the majority of the species can be differentiated by sds-page of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains and between some strains of l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum. however, this study shows that the rapd-pcr (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and aflp are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. the separate species status of the recently described l. amylolyticus and l. iners was fully confirmed.

AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == molecular identification of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == the rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes are useful for the identification of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, and l. amylovorus. however, the oligonucleotide probe designed for l. helveticus hybridized with nucleic acids of type strains of l. gallinarum and l. helveticus. hence, the similarity among the 73 strains of lactobacilli was evaluated on the basis of their randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) profiles derived from five single-primer reactions. these strains were grouped into seven clusters at a similarity level of 30%, which corresponded to six separate species of the l. acidophilus complex (l. johnsonii, l. gallinarum, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri, respectively) and l. helveticus. for the first time, strains of l. gallinarum were characterized by rapd and pfge analyses. the genome length in that species was estimated to be near 1.45 mb with the summation of apai fragments, and near 1.95 mb with the summation of smai fragments.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == 16s-23s and 23s-5s intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable.  the aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions  could be of value in the identification of lactobacillus species. for that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to amplify 16s-23s and 23s-5s spacer regions of lactobacillus (l.) acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. helveticus and l. curvatus. the pcr products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal rna (rrn) operons were identified  in each species studied: one with tandem trna(ile)/trna(ala) genes and the other  one without trna genes. our study revealed that the rrn operons of lactobacillus  species studied comprise the genes of 16s, 23s and 5s rrna, in that order. only the trna genes and the rrna processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. the divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. these sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. theoretical rna/rna secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. in conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16s and 23s rdna sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as l. curvatus and l. casei or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus.

AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

AB  == epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon  cancer. the results, however, remain inconclusive. this prompted us to develop a  new approach based on the use of ht-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line,  to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. undifferentiated ht-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following  bacterial populations: lactobacillus helveticus, bifidobacterium, l.acidophilus or a mix of streptococcus thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. penicillin g was added  to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth  without significant effect on bacterial viability. one out of the four bacteria species studied, namely l.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. the three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of ht-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). the most efficient strains in lowering the ht-29 growth rate were l. helveticus and bifidobacterium. concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv), a sensitive and specific marker of ht-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase n and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.

AB  == reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus ch65, lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. the fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone,  dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta 100) against n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine,  and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine was 2-  and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. extracts of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r were examined further. compounds that were responsible for activity against  both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. adjustment of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r to ph 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. in contrast, compounds with activity specific for n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at ph 7.6. the weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% l-lactic acid.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

TI  == partial characterization of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  == with degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal dna fragment of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the dna sequence of this pcr product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed  an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "rpod box" of primary sigma factors. this pcr product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. these data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == a lactobacillus helveticus-specific dna probe detects restriction fragment length polymorphisms in this species.
AB  == a cloned 2-kb ecori fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total dnas of 75 l. helveticus strains. no hybridization was found with l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l.  gasseri, or l. intestinalis strains. when southern blots of ecori digests of l. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin j.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kda bacteriocin called helveticin j. libraries of chromosomal dna from l. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and  probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin j antibody. two recombinant phage, hj1 and hj4, containing homologous  inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. these two phage clones specifically hybridized to l. helveticus 481 total genomic dna but not to dna from strains that did not produce helveticin j or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. hj1 and hj4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin j. the intact helveticin j gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a  library of l. helveticus chromosomal dna in lambda embl3 with the insert dna from phage hj4 as a probe. the dna sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. orf2 could encode an 11,808-da protein. the l. helveticus dna inserts of the hj1 and hj4 clones reside within orf3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of orf2. orf3 could encode a 37,511-da protein. downstream from orf3, the 5' end of another orf (orf4) was found. a bg/ii fragment containing orf2 and orf3 was cloned into pgk12, and the recombinant plasmid, ptrk135, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. transformants carrying ptrk135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin j.

TI  == an introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. it has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. on the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. as starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus and l. sanfrancisco. in addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily  l. acidophilus, l. reuteri and l. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal  donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in  l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid  determinants in laf and laf.

TI  == fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == detection and activity of lactacin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == a total of 52 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. a majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of lactobacillus leichmannii, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus lactis. four l. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited streptococcus faecalis and  lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by l. acidophilus. the agent produced by l. acidophilus n2 and responsible for inhibition of l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis was investigated. ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. the agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c (ph  5). activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. these characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin b. examination of strains of l. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of johnson et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.

TI  == multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  == genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. helveticus, and l. acidophilus. after treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids.  successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to  isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at  least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. furthermore, the  growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. these findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.
