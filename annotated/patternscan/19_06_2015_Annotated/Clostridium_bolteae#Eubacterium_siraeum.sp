TI  == diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (lama pacos) and sheep (ovis aries).
AB  == two bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. after the amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers, equal quantities of pcr products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. sequence analysis showed that the  60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with eubacterium sp. f1. the 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). clones closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, eubacterium sp. f1, clostridium cellobioparum, mogibacterium neglectum, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridiaceae bacterium wn011, clostridium coccoides, clostridium orbiscindens, eubacterium sp. f1, cytophaga sp. dex80-37, treponema bryantii and pelotomaculum sp. fp were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to anaerovorax odorimutans, treponema zioleckii, bifidobacterium indicum, paludibacter propionicigenes, paraprevotella clara, eubacterium siraeum, desulfotomaculum sp. cyp1, clostridium bolteae, clostridium termitidis and clostridiaceae bacterium djf_ls40 only in the rumen of sheep. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16s rrna gene copies (6.89 [log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71,  p<0.01). the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.
