TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
