TI  - Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. Currently, the most promising candidates in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. Besides the anti-malarial activity, SP is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as IPTp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. METHODS: In this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. RESULTS: SP was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All tested Gram-positive bacteria, except Enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. Additionally, azithromycin was active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: These data indicate important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. Given the large scale use of IPTp in Africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Incidence and behaviour of Tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. One of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(M), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon Tn916. This study aimed to determine whether tet(M) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the Eastman Dental Institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon Tn916. METHODS: The cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. Polymerase chain reactions for tet(M) and for unique regions of Tn916 were carried out on the DNA of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any Tn916-like elements could occur. RESULTS: Eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(M). Furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the Tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(M) gene. Transfer experiments demonstrated that a Neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable Tn916-like element to Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The tet(M) gene is present in the majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon Tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical material to ciprofloxacin].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of bacteria  species isolated from different specimens of clinical materials. The investigated strains (830) were identified using conventional methods. The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied by the method of drug dilution in Mueller-Hinton agar. Among aerobic bacteria, only 5 strains (0.6%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin in concentration 4 micrograms/ml; two belonged to E. coli species, two to S. aureus and one was a Streptococcus group B., Corynebacterium sp. MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml turned out to be most resistant, next, Gram-negative rods MIC90 = 0.5 microgram/ml, coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci and Neisseria sp. MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml. Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobes were the least susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Their MIC90 was 2 and 16 micrograms/ml respectively. Among 20 anaerobic strains, up to 10 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mainly from Bacteroides and Clostridium genus.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Interference of Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  - Aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. Simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. From 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4). Similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. The identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group D streptococci were found for each of those sites. The majority of the interfering isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only simultaneous antagonism. To complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (G-7, G-9, G-10 and G-11). This spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. While the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the Gram positive cocci and the Acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. Gonococcal strains G-7 and G-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain G-3 was the most resistant one.
