TI  == [the function of glutathione/glutathione peroxidase system in the oxidative stress resistance systems of microbial cells].
AB  == the physiological roles of the glutathione(gsh)/glutathione peroxidase(gpx) system in protecting microbial cells against oxidative stress were reviewed. in eukaryotic model microbe saccharomyces cerevisiae,this system is obligatory in maintaining the redox balance and defending the oxidative stress. however, the gsh/gpx system only conditionally exists in prokaryotes. namely,for those prokaryote bacteria containing glutathione reductase and gpx, e.g. haemophilus influenzae and lactococcus lactis, by taking up gsh, they might develop a conditional gsh-dependent gpx reduction system, which conferred cells a stronger  resistance against oxidative challenge.

TI  == characterization of the llaci methyltransferase from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15 provides new insights into the biology of type ii restriction-modification systems.
AB  == the gene encoding the llaci methyltransferase (m.llaci) from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15 was overexpressed in escherichia coli. the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity using three consecutive steps of chromatography  on phosphocellulose, blue-agarose and superose 12hr, yielding a protein of m(r) 31 300+/-1000 under denaturing conditions. the exact position of the start codon  aug was determined by protein microsequencing. this enzyme recognizes the specific palindromic sequence 5'-aagctt-3'. purified m.llaci was characterized. unlike many other methyltransferases, m.llaci exists in solution predominantly as a dimer. it modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to n(6)-methyladenine and thus is functionally identical to the corresponding methyltransferases of the hindiii (haemophilus influenzae rd) and ecoviii (escherichia coli e1585-68) restriction-modification systems. this is reflected in the identity of m.llaci with m.hindiii and m.ecoviii noted at the amino acid sequence level (50 % and 62 %, respectively) and in the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among n(6)-adenine beta-class methyltransferases.  however, polyclonal antibodies raised against m.ecoviii cross-reacted with m.llaci but not with m.hindiii. restriction endonucleases require mg(2+) for phosphodiester bond cleavage. mg(2+) was shown to be a strong inhibitor of the m.llaci enzyme and its isospecific homologues. this observation suggests that sensitivity of the m.llaci to mg(2+) may strengthen the restriction activity of the cognate endonuclease in the bacterial cell. other biological implications of  this finding are also discussed.

TI  == genetic organization and molecular analysis of the ecoviii restriction-modification system of escherichia coli e1585-68 and its comparison with isospecific homologs.
AB  == the ecoviii restriction-modification (r-m) system is carried by the escherichia coli e1585-68 natural plasmid pec156 (4,312 bp). the two genes were cloned and characterized. the g+c content of the ecoviii r-m system is 36.1%, which is significantly lower than the average g+c content of either plasmid pec156 (43.6%) or e. coli genomic dna (50.8%). the difference suggests that there is a possibility that the ecoviii r-m system was recently acquired by the genome. the  921-bp ecoviii endonuclease (r. ecoviii) gene (ecoviiir) encodes a 307-amino-acid protein with an m(r) of 35,554. the convergently oriented ecoviii methyltransferase (m. ecoviii) gene (ecoviiim) consists of 912 bp that code for a 304-amino-acid protein with an m(r) of 33,930. the exact positions of the start codon aug were determined by protein microsequencing. both enzymes recognize the  specific palindromic sequence 5'-aagctt-3'. preparations of ecoviii r-m enzymes purified to homogeneity were characterized. r. ecoviii acts as a dimer and cleaves a specific sequence between two adenine residues, leaving 4-nucleotide 5' protruding ends. m. ecoviii functions as a monomer and modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to n(6)-methyladenine. these enzymes are thus functionally identical to the corresponding enzymes of the hindiii (haemophilus influenzae rd) and llaci (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w15) r-m systems. this finding is reflected by the levels of homology of m. ecoviii with m. hindiii and m. llaci at the amino acid sequence level (50 and 62%, respectively) and by the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among m(6) n-adenine beta-class methyltransferases. the deduced amino acid sequence of  r. ecoviii shows weak homology with its two isoschizomers, r. hindiii (26%) and r. llaci (17%). a catalytic sequence motif characteristic of restriction endonucleases was found in the primary structure of r. ecoviii (d(108)x(12)dxk(123)), as well as in the primary structures of r. llaci and r. hindiii. polyclonal antibodies raised against r. ecoviii did not react with r. hindiii, while anti-m. ecoviii antibodies cross-reacted with m. llaci but not with m. hindiii. r. ecoviii requires mg(ii) ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage. we found that the same ions are strong inhibitors of the m. ecoviii enzyme. the biological implications of this finding are discussed.

TI  == gene cloning, sequencing, and inactivation of the branched-chain aminotransferase of lactococcus lactis lm0230.
AB  == a branched-chain aminotransferase gene (ilve) from lactococcus lactis lm0230 was  identified on a 9-kb chromosomal insert by complementation in escherichia coli dl39. sequencing of a 2.0-kbp fragment resulted in the identification of a 1,023-bp open reading frame that could encode a 340-amino-acid protein. sequence  analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed 62% identity to ilve of haemophilus influenzae and high similarity to ilves from a variety of organisms found in genbank classified as class iv aminotransferases. under logarithmic growth in complex medium, ilve is transcribed monocistronically as a 1.1-kb transcript. hydrophobicity plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the lack of a signal peptide sequence suggest ilve is a cytosolic protein. a derivative of lm0230 lacking ilve activity was constructed by gene replacement. comparison of the ilve-deficient strain's ability to grow in defined media lacking an amino acid but containing its alpha-keto acid biosynthetic precursor to that of the wild-type strain indicated that ilve is the only enzyme capable of synthesis of ile and val from their biosynthetic precursors. comparison of the aminotransferase activity of the ilve mutant to lm0230 revealed that the mutant retained <2, 4.5, 43, 40, and 76% of its aminotransferase activity with ile, val, leu, met, and phe, respectively. no difference in growth or acidification rate between lm0230 and the ilve-deficient strain was observed in milk.

TI  == characteristics of chi distribution on different bacterial genomes.
AB  == the availability of full genome sequences provides the bases for analyzing global properties of the genetic text. for example, oligonucleotide sequences that are over- or underrepresented can be identified by taking into account the overall genome composition and organization. one of the most overrepresented oligonucleotides in escherichia coli is the chi site, an octanucleotide that stimulates dna repair by homologous recombination. here we analyze the genomic distribution of chi in e. coli and in the three other bacteria where a chi sequence has been identified; note that chi is a different sequence in each organism. for each bacterial genome, chi sequences are frequent, regularly distributed, and overrepresented. this suggests that selection for chi may have occurred during evolution to favor efficient repair of a damaged chromosome. other characteristics of chi distribution are not conserved and might reflect specific features of dna repair in each host. the different sequence and characteristics of chi in each microorganism suggest that selection for chi occurred independently in different bacteria.

TI  == low-redundancy sequencing of the entire lactococcus lactis il1403 genome.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is an at-rich gram positive bacterium phylogenetically close to the genus streptococcus. various strains of l. lactis are used in dairy industry as starters for cheese making. l. lactis is also one of the well characterized laboratory microorganisms, widely used for studies on physiology of lactic acid bacteria. we describe here a low redundancy sequence of the genome of the strain l. lactis il1403. the strategy which we followed to determine the sequence consists of two main steps. first, a limited number of plasmids and lambda-phages that carry random segments of the genome were sequenced. second, sequences of the inserts were used for production of novel sequencing templates by applying multiplex long accurate pcr protocols. using of these pcr products allowed to determine the sequence of the entire 2.35 mb genome with a very low redundancy, close to 2. the error rate of the sequence is estimated to be below 1%. the correctness of the sequence assembly was confirmed by pcr amplification of the entire l. lactis il1403 genome, using a set of 266 oligonucleotides. anotation of the sequence was undertaken by using automatic gene prediction computer tools. this allowed to identify 1495 protein-encoding genes, to locate them on the genome map and to classify their functions on the basis of homology to known proteins. the function of about 700 genes expected to encode proteins that lack homologs in data bases cannot be reliably predicted in this way. the approach which we used eliminates high redundancy sequencing and mapping efforts, needed to obtain detailed and comprehensive genetic and physical maps of a bacterium. availability of detailed genetic and physical maps of the l. lactis il1403 genome provides many entries to study metabolism and physiology of bacteria from this group. the presence of 42 copies of five different is elements in the il1403 genome confirms the importance of these elements for genetic exchange in lactococci. these include two previously unknown elements, present at seven and fifteen copies and designated is1077 and is983, respectively. five potential or rudimentary prophages were identified in the genome by detecting clusters of phage-related genes. the metabolic and regulatory potential of l. lactis was evaluated by inspecting gene sets classified into different functional categories. l. lactis has the genetic potential to synthesise 20 standard amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and at least four cofactors. some of these metabolites, which are usually present in chemically defined media, can probably be omitted. about twenty compounds can be used by l. lactis as a sole carbon source. some 83 regulators were revealed, indicating a regulatory potential close to that of haemophilus influenzae, a bacterium with a similar genome size. unexpectedly, l. lactis has a complete set of late competence genes, which may have concerted transcriptional regulation and unleadered polycistronic  mrnas. these findings open new possibilities for developing genetic tools, useful for studies of gene regulation in at-rich gram positive bacteria and for engineering of new strains for the diary industry.

TI  == identification of a virulence-associated protein homolog gene and isra1 in a plasmid of riemerella anatipestifer.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer is the causative agent of polyserositis of ducks and geese. we have previously reported that a 3.9-kb plasmid, pcfc1, carries protein  genes (vapd1 and vapd2) that are similar to virulence-associated genes of other bacteria. in the present study, we report the complete sequence of a second plasmid of 5.6 kb, pcfc2. pcfc2 has a 28% g-c content and three large open reading frames (orfs). one of the orfs (designated asvapd1) encodes a polypeptide that shares 53.9, 53.9, 48.3, 48.3 and 46.1% identity with virulence-associated proteins of dichelobacter nodosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria gonorrhoeae, helicobacter pylori and haemophilus influenzae, respectively. the second orf encodes a putative dna replication protein (repa3) with 309 amino acids and a molecular mass of approximately 36 kda. a novel insertion sequence (is) element, designated isra1, was found on the plasmid pcfc2. isra1 was flanked by 15-bp imperfect inverted repeats (only one mismatched nucleotide). isra1 contained an orf encoding a putative transposase of 292 amino  acids. southern blot analysis indicated that in r. anatipestifer strains examined, isra1 was present with 2-20 copies (at least). isra1 displayed a sequence approximately 35% homologous to the putative is982 and rsbst-alpha from  lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris sk11 and bacillus stearothermophilus cu21. three hybridization patterns of genomic dna of eight r. anatipestifer strains with an isra1 probe indicated that isra1 might be a useful tool for epidemiological studies.

TI  == histidinol phosphate phosphatase, catalyzing the penultimate step of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, is encoded by ytvp (hisj) in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the deduced product of the bacillus subtilis ytvp gene is similar to that of orf13, a gene of unknown function in the lactococcus lactis histidine biosynthesis operon. a b. subtilis ytvp mutant was auxotrophic for histidine. the only enzyme of the histidine biosynthesis pathway that remained uncharacterized in b. subtilis was histidinol phosphate phosphatase (holpase), catalyzing the penultimate step of this pathway. holpase activity could not be detected in crude extracts of the ytvp mutant, while purified glutathione s-transferase-ytvp fusion protein exhibited strong holpase activity. these observations demonstrated that holpase is encoded by ytvp in b. subtilis and led us to rename this gene hisj. together with the holpase of saccharomyces cerevisiae and the presumed holpases of l. lactis and schizosaccharomyces pombe, hisj constitutes a family of related  enzymes that are not homologous to the holpases of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs  and a metal ion.
AB  == thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. in addition to the hexxh signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids  was noticed, egcls, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. the study of site-directed mutants of the e. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. seven sequences coming from haemophilus influenzae, lactococcus lactis, bacillus stearothermophilus, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, bacillus subtilus and synechocystis sp. could be identified. the characterization of the product of the open reading frame from b. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the e. coli enzyme. alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, gxgxaaxq, is strictly conserved. this motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the e. coli enzyme. site-directed variants of  e. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues  for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build  up the active site around a metal ion. finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the e. coli enzyme. this enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.

TI  == purification and characterization of a malic enzyme from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis atcc 15352 and cloning and sequencing of its gene.
AB  == malic enzyme (ec 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes l-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from streptococcus bovis atcc 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. the 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. the enzymatic properties of the s. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. however, we found that the s. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisocaproate. the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of the l-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. a sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299  and 1,170 nucleotides long. the 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of bacillus stearothermophilus and haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of lactococcus lactis.
