TI  - Enterobacter and Klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in Valencia (Spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. In this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in Enterobacter and Klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in Valencia, Spain). A total of 96 isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 Enterobacter isolates (59 E. cloacae, two E. aerogenes, two E. cancerogenus, one E. gergoviae, and four E. sakazakii, currently Cronobacter spp.), and 28 Klebsiella isolates (19 K. oxytoca and 9 K. pneumoniae). Only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. Most isolates were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 Enterobacter and 16 Klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). Other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). Multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 E. cloacae isolates), four (one E. cloacae and one K. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two E. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. The presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. In addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. Therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of multidrug-resistant zoonotic Enterobacter spp. in poultry of Bangladesh.
AB  - Poultry and poultry products are major contributors of zoonotic pathogens. Limited data are available on Enterobacter spp. as a potent zoonotic pathogen in poultry. The present study is a first endeavor on the emergence of multidrug-resistant zoonotic Enterobacter spp. and its prevalence arising from poultry in Bangladesh. Cloacal swabs from poultry samples of five different farms at Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh were collected and from 106 isolates, 18 presumptive Enterobacter spp. were obtained. Antibiogram using 19 used antibiotics belonging to 15 major groups revealed that all of the 18 isolates were completely resistant to penicillin and rifampicin, but differed in their drug resistance pattern against ampicillin (94.4%), clindamycin (94.4%), erythromycin (94.4%), vancomycin (88.9%), sulfonamides (72.2%), imipenem (66.6%), streptomycin (55.6%), nitrofurantoin (33.3%), doxycycline (33.3%), tetracyclines (33.3%), cefepime (11.1%), and gentamicin (5.6%). All Enterobacter spp. were found to be plasmid free, implying that multidrug-resistant properties are chromosomal borne. The vanA and sulI were detected by polymerase chain reaction assay in 17 and 13 isolates, respectively. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA distributed the 18 multidrug-resistant Enterobacter spp. into three genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the representatives of the three genotypes using partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (approximately 900 bp) showed that the genotypically diverse groups belonged to Enterobacter hormaechei, E. cloacae, and E. cancerogenus, respectively. The clinical significance of the close relative Enterobacter spp. is indicative of their zoonotic potential. Therefore, urgent intervention is required to limit the emergence and spread of these bacteria in poultry feed as well as prudent use of antibiotics among poultry farmers in Bangladesh.
TI  - Isolation of Rhizobacteria from Jatropha curcas and characterization of produced  ACC deaminase.
AB  - Decreased levels of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) result in lower levels of endogenous ethylene, which eliminate the potentially inhibitory effects of stress-induced higher ethylene concentrations. It is worth noting the substantial ability of the bacterial species to colonize different environments, including taxonomically distinct plants cultivated in distantly separated geographical regions. For example, Enterobacter cloacae, designated as MSA1 and Enterobacter cancerogenus, designated as MSA2 were recovered from the rhizosphere of Jatropha in the present work. This study first time confirms the ACC deaminase activity in the Enterobacter cancerogenus on the preliminary basis. Several bacterial plant growth-promoting mechanisms were analyzed and detected like phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, IAA production, GA(3) (gibberellic acid) production and ACC deaminase activity in the isolated cultures. Isolates were grown until exponential growth phase to evaluate their ACC deaminase activity and the effect of pH, temperature, salt, metals and substrate concentration after the partial purification of enzyme by ion exchange chromatography. The FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) spectra were recorded for the confirmation of alpha-ketobutyrate production. By using lineweaver Burk plot K(m) and V(max) value for ACC deaminase of both the organism was calculated in the different fractions. In this work, we discuss the possible implications of these bacterial mechanisms on the plant growth promotion or homeostasis regulation in natural conditions.
TI  - Enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on Morus alba L.
AB  - Two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis combined with rpoB gene sequence analysis allocated strains R18-2(T) and R3-3 to the genus Enterobacter, with Enterobacter asburiae, E. amnigenus, E. cancerogenus, E. cloacae subsp. cloacae, E. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and E. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. Cells of the isolates were Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a DNA G+C content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. Calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of E. cancerogenus or E. asburiae or a closely related species. Biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. DNA-DNA relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related Enterobacter strains. Based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Enterobacter, named Enterobacter mori sp. nov. The type strain is R18-2(T) ( = CGMCC 1.10322(T) = LMG 25706(T)).
TI  - Population genetics of the nomenspecies Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The genetic heterogeneity of the nomenspecies Enterobacter cloacae is well known. Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Enterobacter dissolvens, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter kobei, and Enterobacter nimipressuralis are closely related to it and are subsumed in the so-called E. cloacae complex. DNA-DNA hybridization studies performed previously identified at least five DNA-relatedness groups of this complex. In order to analyze the genetic structure and the phylogenetic relationships between the clusters of the nomenspecies E. cloacae, 206 strains collected from 22 hospitals, a veterinarian, and an agricultural center in 11 countries plus all 13 type strains of the genus and reference strain CDC 1347-71(R) were examined with a combination of sequence and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses of the three housekeeping genes hsp60, rpoB, and hemB as well as ampC, the gene of a class C beta-lactamase. Based on the neighbor-joining tree of the hsp60 sequences, 12 genetic clusters (I to XII) and an unstable sequence crowd (xiii) were identified. The robustness of the genetic clusters was confirmed by analyses of rpoB and hemB sequences and ampC PCR-RFLPs. Sequence crowd xiii split into two groups after rpoB analysis. Only three strains formed a cluster with the type strain of E. cloacae, indicating that the minority of isolates identified as E. cloacae truly belong to the species; 13% of strains grouped with other type strains of the genus, suggesting that the phenotypes of these species seem to be more heterogeneous than so far believed. Three clusters represented 70% of strains, but none of them included a type or reference strain. The genetic clustering presented in this study might serve as a framework for future studies dealing with taxonomic, evolutionary, epidemiological, or pathogenetic characteristics of bacteria belonging to the E. cloacae complex.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase gene and surrounding DNA sequences of Citrobacter braakii, Citrobacter murliniae, Citrobacter werkmanii, Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacter cancerogenus.
AB  - To further identify the origins of plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases that are currently spreading worldwide, the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of Citrobacter braakii, Citrobacter murliniae, Citrobacter werkmanii reference strains and of Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacter cancerogenus clinical isolates were cloned and expressed into Escherichia coli and sequenced. These beta-lactamases had all a single pI value >8 and conferred a typical AmpC-type resistance pattern in E. coli recombinant strains. The cloned inserts obtained from genomic DNAs of each strain encoded Ambler class C beta-lactamases. The AmpC-type enzymes of C. murliniae, C. braakii and C. werkmanii shared 99%, 96% and 95% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases from Citrobacter freundii. The AmpC-type enzyme of E. cancerogenus shared 85% amino acid sequence identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae OUDhyp and the AmpC-type enzyme of E. fergusonii shared 96% amino acid sequence identity with that of E. coli K12. The ampC genes, except for E. fergusonii, were associated with genes homologous to regulatory ampR genes of other chromosomal class C beta-lactamases that explain inducibility of beta-lactamase expression in these strains. This work provides further evidence of the molecular heterogeneity of class C beta-lactamases.
TI  - Chromosomal ampC genes in Enterobacter species other than Enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the ACT-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to Enterobacter asburiae.
AB  - The amplification and sequence of ampC genes in Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Enterobacter dissolvens, Enterobacter hormaechei and Enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus Enterobacter to seven. Expression in Escherichia coli of the ampC genes from E. asburiae, E. hormaechei and E. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampC from E. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(ACT-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from Enterobacter cloacae. The reassignment of ACT-1 ancestry to E. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampR upstream of bla(ACT-1) and ampR from E. asburiae.
TI  - Identification by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of an Enterobacteriaceae species with ambiguous biochemical profile from a renal transplant recipient.
AB  - Traditional ways of identification of bacteria by phenotypic characteristics cannot be used for non-cultivable organisms and organisms with unusual biochemical profiles. In this study, an Enterobacteriaceae was isolated in pure growth from the mid-stream urine of a 67-year old renal transplant recipient with urinary tract infection. Conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern resembling any known member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The Vitek system (GNI+) showed that it was 18% Leclercia adecarboxylata and 55% Klebsiella ozaenae; whereas the API system (20E) showed that it was 99.8% Rahnella aquatilis. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing showed that there was 7 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter cloacae, 18 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter asburiae, 17 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter cancerogenus, 35 base differences between the isolate and K. ozaenae, 27 base differences between the isolate and L. adecarboxylata, and 72 base differences between the isolate and R. aquatilis, indicating that the isolate most closely resembled a strain of E. cloacae. Identification of the organism in this study is important, as the choice of antibiotics would be radically different. In this case, cephalosporins should be avoided regardless of in-vitro susceptibility as cephalosporins are well-known to select for AmpC derepressed mutants in Enterobacter, and previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins is more likely to be associated with multidrug resistant Enterobacter isolates than is administration of antibiotics that do not include a third-generation cephalosporin.
