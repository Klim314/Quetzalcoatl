TI  == observations on citrobacter species from a tertiary care health center with special reference to multi-drug resistance and presence of ctx-m gene.
AB  == background: citrobacter is an important nosocomial pathogen and its multi-drug resistant (mdr) isolates are increasingly being reported across the globe. they are known to produce extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) and harbor ctx-m gene. objective: the aim was to isolate citrobacter sp. from clinical specimens,  analyze their mdr status and look for the presence of ctx-m gene. materials and methods: in this prospective study, citrobacter isolates positive for esbl on screening, were confirmed by combined disc method along with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for cefotaxime. in selected cefotaxime resistant isolates, multiplex polymerase chain reaction was done for blactx-m gene. results: of 146 citrobacter sp. isolated, most (73%) were from admitted patients and hospital stay of >72 h and prior antibiotic intake were the most common associated factors. maximum isolates were from pus (41.1%). citrobacter freundii was the commonest species (49%) followed by citrobacter koseri (28%); 79 were esbl producers. seventy were cefotaxime resistant as shown by mic. blactx-m gene was detected in 15/40 of these isolates, all belonged to ctx-m group 1. conclusion: overall incidence of citrobacter in our setup is low, but they were mostly mdr, and esbl production was high, which is a cause of concern. blactx-m gene detection is important because of its rapid transmission to other bacterial species.

TI  == classification of citrobacteria by dna hybridization: designation of citrobacter  farmeri sp. nov., citrobacter youngae sp. nov., citrobacter braakii sp. nov., citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov., citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., and three unnamed  citrobacter genomospecies.
AB  == dna relatedness studies (hydroxyapatite method) were done on 112 strains of citrobacteria. by using the recommended definition of a genomospecies 11 genomospecies were identified in the genus citrobacter. these genomospecies were  separable by their biochemical profiles. citrobacter koseri (citrobacter diversus) and citrobacter amalonaticus proved to be homogeneous species, as previously described. c. amalonaticus biogroup 1, as described by farmer et al. (j. clin. microbiol. 21:46-76, 1985), was shown to be a separate homogeneous species, which was named citrobacter farmeri sp. nov. the citrobacter freundii complex was quite heterogeneous. c. freundii sensu stricto, as represented by the type strain, contained only 9 of 66 strains in this complex. the remaining 57 strains were members of seven genomospecies. genomospecies 5, containing 21 strains, was named citrobacter youngae sp. nov. genomospecies 6, containing 15 strains, was named citrobacter braakii sp. nov. genomospecies 7 and 8, each containing six strains, were named citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov. and citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., respectively. genomospecies 9, 10, and 11, each containing three strains, were not named.
