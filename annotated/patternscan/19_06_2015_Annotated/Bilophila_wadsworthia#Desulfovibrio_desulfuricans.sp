TI  == pcr-based detection of resistance genes in anaerobic bacteria isolated from intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == little information is available on the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in anaerobes in japan. to understand the background of antimicrobial resistance in anaerobes involved in intra-abdominal infections, we investigated the distribution of eight antimicrobial resistance genes (cepa, cfia, cfxa, ermf, ermb, mefa, tetq, and nim) and a mutation in the gyra gene in a total of 152 organisms (bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas spp., bilophila wadsworthia, desulfovibrio desulfuricans, veillonella spp., gram-positive cocci, and non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli) isolated between 2003 and 2004 in japan. the cepa gene was distributed primarily in bacteroides fragilis. gene cfxa was detected in about 9 % of the bacteroides isolates and 75 % of the prevotella spp. isolates and did not appear to contribute to cephamycin resistance. two strains of b. fragilis contained the metallo-beta-lactamase gene cfia, but they did not produce the protein product. gene tetq was detected in about 81, 44, and 63 % of b. fragilis isolates, other bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. isolates, respectively. the ermf gene was detected in 25, 13, 56, 64, and 16 % of bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., b. wadsworthia, and anaerobic cocci, respectively. gene mefa  was found in only 10 % of the b. fragilis strains and 3 % of the non-b. fragilis  strains. genes nim and ermb were not detected in any isolate. substitution at position 82 (ser to phe) in gyra was detected in b. fragilis isolates that were less susceptible or resistant to moxifloxacin. this study is the first report on  the distribution of resistance genes in anaerobes isolated from intra-abdominal infections in japan. we expect that the results might help in understanding the resistance mechanisms of specific anaerobes.

TI  == abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in the healthy human colon.
AB  == hydrogenotrophic microbiota have a significant impact on colonic health; however, little is known about their diversity and ecology in situ. here, molecular-based  methods and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance and diversity of mucosa-associated hydrogenotrophic microbes in 90 biopsies collected from right colon, left colon and rectum of 25 healthy subjects. functional genes  of all three hydrogenotrophic groups were detected in at least one colonic region of all subjects. methanogenic archaea (ma) constituted approximately one half of  the hydrogenotrophic microbiota in each colonic region. sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were more abundant than acetogens in right colon, while acetogens were more abundant than srb in left colon and rectum. ma genotypes exhibited low diversity, whereas srb genotypes were diverse and generally similar across the three regions within subject but significantly variable among subjects. multivariate cluster analysis defined subject-specific patterns for the diversity of srb genotypes; however, neither subject- nor region-specific clusters were observed for the abundance of hydrogenotrophic functional genes. sequence analyses of functional gene clones revealed that mucosa-associated srb were phylogenetically related to  desulfovibrio piger, desulfovibrio desulfuricans and bilophila wadsworthia; whereas ma were related to methanobrevibacter spp., mb. smithii and the order methanomicrobiales. together these data demonstrate for the first time that the human colonic mucosa is persistently colonized by all three groups of hydrogenotrophic microbes, which exhibit segmental and interindividual variation  in abundance and diversity.

TI  == biochemical differentiation and comparison of desulfovibrio species and other phenotypically similar genera.
AB  == seventeen human clinical isolates representing four species of desulfovibrio were characterized using 16s rrna gene sequences and tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, bile, urease, formate-fumarate stimulation, desulfoviridin, motility, and hydrogen sulfide production, plus susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. eighty additional strains representing 10 phenotypically similar genera (bilophila, selenomonas, capnocytophaga, campylobacter, bacteroides, sutterella,  anaerobiospirillum, dialister, veillonella, and mobiluncus) were included for comparison. all desulfovibrio species produced h2s and were desulfoviridin positive, and all desulfovibrio species except d. piger were motile. the four desulfovibrio species could be distinguished from each other using tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, urease, and growth on bile, with the following results (positive [+], negative [-], growth [g], and no growth [ng]): for d. piger, -, -, -, -, and g, respectively; for d. fairfieldensis, +, -, +, -, and g, respectively; for d. desulfuricans, -, -, +, +, and ng, respectively; and for d.  vulgaris, -, +, -, -, and g, respectively. resistance to the 10-microg colistin disk separated the desulfovibrio species from most of the other genera, which were usually susceptible. these simple tests were useful for characterizing the desulfovibrio species and differentiating them from other phenotypically similar  genera.

TI  == dissimilatory sulfite reductase (desulfoviridin) of the taurine-degrading, non-sulfate-reducing bacterium bilophila wadsworthia rzatau contains a fused dsrb-dsrd subunit.
AB  == a dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsr) was purified from the anaerobic, taurine-degrading bacterium bilophila wadsworthia rzatau to apparent homogeneity. the enzyme is involved in energy conservation by reducing sulfite, which is formed during the degradation of taurine as an electron acceptor, to sulfide. according to its uv-visible absorption spectrum with maxima at 392, 410, 583, and 630 nm, the enzyme belongs to the desulfoviridin type of dsrs. the sulfite reductase was isolated as an alpha2beta)gamma(n) (n > or = 2) multimer with a native size of 285 kda as determined by gel filtration. we have sequenced the genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits (dsra and dsrb, respectively), which probably constitute one operon. dsra and dsrb encode polypeptides of 49 (alpha) and 54 kda (beta) which show significant similarities to the homologous subunits  of other dsrs. the dsrb gene product of b. wadsworthia is apparently a fusion protein of dsrb and dsrd. this indicates a possible functional role of dsrd in dsr function because of its presence as a fusion protein as an integral part of the dsr holoenzyme in b. wadsworthia. a phylogenetic analysis using the available dsr sequences revealed that b. wadsworthia grouped with its closest 16s rdna relative desulfovibrio desulfuricans essex 6.
