TI  == disinfection protocols to prevent cross-contamination between dental offices and  prosthetic laboratories.
AB  == control of cross-contamination between dental offices and prosthetic laboratories is of utmost importance to maintain the health of patients and dental office staff. the purpose of this study was to evaluate disinfection protocols, considering antimicrobial effectiveness and damage to the structures of prostheses. solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% vinegar and sodium perborate were evaluated. specimens were contaminated in vitro with standardized suspensions of candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis spores. disinfection by immersion for 10 min was performed. final counts of microorganisms were obtained using the plating method. results were statistically compared by kruskal-wallis anova and dunn's test. the surface roughness of 40 specimens was analyzed before and after 10 disinfection cycles, and results were  compared statistically using student's t test. the solution of 50% vinegar was as effective as 1% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine against c. albicans, e.  coli and s. mutans. the sodium perborate solution showed the lowest antimicrobial effectiveness. superficial roughness increased after cycles in 1% sodium hypochlorite (p=0.02). solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine and  50% vinegar were effective for the disinfection of heat-polymerized acrylic specimens. sodium hypochlorite increased the superficial roughness.

TI  == effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for the disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for  the disinfection of gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and bacillus  subtilus (in spore form). two hundred and twenty-five gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the cones were divided into 10 experimental groups (n = 15), according to the microorganism tested and disinfection testing times. the disinfection procedure consisted of immersing each cone in a plastic tube containing the substance. the specimens remained in contact with the substance for 1 or 2.5 minutes. afterwards, each cone was transferred to a 10% sodium thiosulphate solution (na(2)s(2)o(3)) to neutralize the disinfectant. microbial biofilms adhering to the cones were dispersed by agitation. aliquots of 0.1 ml of the suspensions obtained were plated on sabouraud dextrose agar, or brain and heart infusion agar, and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the results were expressed in colony forming units (cfu/ml) and the data were submitted to the wilcoxon signed rank test (level of significance at 0.05). a significant reduction was observed, after 1 minute of exposure, in the test solution for c. albicans (p = 0.0190), s. aureus (p = 0.0001), s. mutans (p = 0.0001), b. subtilis (p = 0.0001), and e. coli (p = 0.0001). after 2.5 minutes of exposure, 100% of the microbial inocula were eliminated. it was concluded that the 2% peracetic acid solution was effective against the biofilms of the tested microorganisms on gutta-percha cones at 1 minute of exposure.

TI  == induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice immunized with an amino-terminal polypeptide of streptococcus mutans p1 protein produced by a recombinant bacillus subtilis strain.
AB  == the oral pathogen streptococcus mutans expresses a surface protein, p1, which interacts with the salivary pellicle on the tooth surface or with fluid-phase saliva, resulting in bacterial adhesion or aggregation, respectively. p1 is a target of protective immunity. its n-terminal region has been associated with adhesion and aggregation functions and contains epitopes recognized by efficacious antibodies. in this study, we used bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive expression host, to produce a recombinant n-terminal polypeptide of p1 (p1(39-512)) derived from the s. mutans strain ua159. purified p1(39-512) reacted with an anti-full-length p1 antiserum as well as one raised against intact s. mutans cells, indicating preserved antigenicity. immunization of mice with soluble and heat-denatured p1(39-512) induced antibodies that reacted specifically with native p1 on the surface of s. mutans cells. the anti-p1(39-512) antiserum was as effective at blocking saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells and better at blocking bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated plastic surfaces compared with the anti-full-length p1 antiserum. in addition, adsorption of the anti-p1 antiserum with p1(39-512) eliminated its ability to block the adhesion of s. mutans cells to abiotic surfaces. the present results indicate that p1(39-512), expressed and purified from a recombinant b. subtilis strain, maintains important immunological features of the native protein and represents an additional tool for the development of anticaries vaccines.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from bacillus sp. v230.
AB  == the beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from bacillus sp. v230 has been cloned in  escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. the product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion  and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. the a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the bacillus subtilis  levanscrase (63.7% identity), the streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == construction of a model secretion system for oral streptococci.
AB  == a dna fragment corresponding to the secretory domain from the streptococcus mutans gs-5 gtfb gene, which encodes the putative 38-amino-acid signal peptide of the glucosyltransferase i (gtf-i) enzyme product, has been constructed. this fragment was fused with the alpha-amylase structural gene from alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain 707. this hybrid gene as well as the intact amylase gene were introduced into an escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector consisting of three components: the e. coli replicon p15aori from pacyc177, an erythromycin resistance gene from pam beta-1, and the streptococcal replicon from pva838. transformation of the oral noncariogenic bacterium streptococcus gordonii with the chimeric plasmid harboring the hybrid amylase gene resulted in strong extracellular amylase production. by contrast, transformants containing the intact amylase gene exhibited only trace amounts of amylase activity in culture fluids. since the two signal peptide structures of the gtf-i enzyme and the bacillus amylase are distinct from each other, these differences might result from the inability of s. gordonii to correctly process the bacillus signal peptide. furthermore, culture fluids from transformants of s. mutans as well as streptococcus milleri harboring the hybrid amylase gene showed only weak amylase  activity. deletion of the gtfb, gtfc, or ftf gene from s. mutans gs-5 did not increase amylase secretion following transformation with the hybrid amylase gene. these results suggest that in contrast to s. gordonii, the inability of s. mutans and s. milleri to secrete hybrid amylase molecules could result from incorrect interaction of the secretory components of these organisms with amylase precursor molecules.
