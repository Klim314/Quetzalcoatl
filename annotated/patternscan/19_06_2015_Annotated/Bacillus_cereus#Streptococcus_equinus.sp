TI  == bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. as a unique class ii lantibiotic, bovicin hj50 is produced by streptococcus bovis hj50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. by using its precursor bova as a drive sequence, 16 bova-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. from them, three representative novel lan loci from clostridium perfringens d str. jgs1721, bacillus cereus as 1.348 and b. thuringiensis as 1.013 were identified by pcr screening. the corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. the disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. further analysis indicated  that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin hj50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. this  study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics.

TI  == effect of bovicin hc5 on growth and spore germination of bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp.
AB  == aims: to use bovicin hc5 to inhibit predominant bacteria isolated from spoiled mango pulp. methods and results: bovicin hc5 and nisin were added to brain heart  infusion (bhi) medium (40-160 au ml(-1)) or mango pulp (100 au ml(-1)) and the growth of bacillus cereus and bacillus thuringiensis was monitored. cultures treated with bovicin hc5 or nisin showed longer lag phases and grew slower in bhi medium. bovicin hc5 and nisin were bactericidal and showed higher activity in mango pulp at acidic ph values. to determine the effect on spore germination and  d values, mango pulp containing bovicin hc5 was inoculated with 10(6) and 10(9) spores per ml(-1), respectively, from each strain tested. bovicin hc5 reduced the outgrowth of spores from b. cereus and b. thuringiensis, but thermal sensitivity  was not affected. conclusions: bovicin hc5 was bactericidal against b. cereus and b. thuringiensis isolated from spoiled mango pulp. significance and impact of the study: bacillus cereus and b. thuringiensis had not been previously isolated from spoiled mango pulp and bovicin hc5 has the potential to inhibit such bacteria in  fruit pulps.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, produced by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity and the influence of culture condition on the growth and bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, production by streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277. methods and results: thermophilin 1277, which was produced  by s. thermophilus sbt1277, showed an antimicrobial activity against several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage bacteria including clostridium butylicum,  c. sprogenes and bacillus cereus. thermophilin 1277 was inactivated by proteinase k. heating treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity. the partially purified thermophilin 1277 had an apparent molecular mass of 3.7 kda. n-terminal  sequence analysis revealed 15 amino acid residues that correspond with amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics bovicin hj50 produced by streptococcus bovis hj50. the effects of culture condition for the bacteriocin production by s. thermophilus sbt1277 were studied. during the batch fermentation, thermophilin 1277 was produced in m17 broth, but no bacteriocin production occurred in the sucrose-tryptone (st) broth. bacteriocin production was detected in ph controlled st broth at ph values of 5.5-6.5. conclusions: thermophilin 1277 production from  s. thermophilus strain depended on the culture conditions. some characters and n-terminal amino acid sequence of thermophilin 1277 differed from bacteriocins produced by s. thermophilus reported previously. significance and impact of the study: streptococcus thermophilus sbt1277 or its bacteriocin which has a wide inhibitory spectrum has a potential use as a biopreservative in dairy products.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  == all the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 mrad. the spore-former bacillus cereus (pcj 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. the tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: proteus vulgaris, irregular  vi, escherichia coli i, e. coli iii, and salmonella typhi-murium. yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant b. cereus (pcj 213) and the more sensitive gram-negative organisms.
