TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  == here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia. from 22 airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the mongolian provinces of arhangai, bulgan, dundgobi, tov, uburhangai and umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. the genus lactobacillus is a core  bacterial component of mongolian fermented milks, and lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant  species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the airag, khoormog and tarag samples, respectively. by using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most lab species that have been isolated as well as seven lab species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. a subsequent analysis of the  principal components of the samples revealed that l. delbrueckii, l. helveticus,  l. kefiranofaciens and streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.

TI  == use of whey lactose from dairy industry for economical kefiran production by lactobacillus kefiranofaciens in mixed cultures with yeasts.
AB  == to evaluate the feasibility of producing kefiran industrially, whey lactose, a by-product from dairy industry, was used as a low cost carbon source. because the accumulation of lactic acid as a by-product of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens inhibited cell growth and kefiran production, the kefir grain derived and non-derived yeasts were screened for their abilities to reduce lactic acid and promote kefiran production in a mixed culture. six species of yeasts were examined: torulaspora delbrueckii ifo 1626; saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo 0216; debaryomyces hansenii tistr 5155; saccharomyces exiguus tistr 5081; zygosaccharomyces rouxii tistr 5044; and saccharomyces carlsbergensis tistr 5018. the mixed culture of l. kefiranofaciens with s. cerevisiae ifo 0216 enhanced the  kefiran production best from 568 mg/l in the pure culture up to 807 and 938 mg/l  in the mixed cultures under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions, respectively.  the optimal conditions for kefiran production by the mixed culture were: whey lactose 4%; yeast extract 4%; initial ph of 5.5; and initial amounts of l. kefiranofaciens and s. cerevisiae ifo 0216 of 2.1x10(7) and 4.0x10(6)cfu/ml, respectively. scaling up the mixed culture in a 2l bioreactor with dissolved oxygen control at 5% and ph control at 5.5 gave the maximum kefiran production of 2,580 mg/l in batch culture and 3,250 mg/l in fed-batch culture.

TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.
