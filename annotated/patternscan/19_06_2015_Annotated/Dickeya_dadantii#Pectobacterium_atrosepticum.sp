TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == evolution of the metabolic and regulatory networks associated with oxygen availability in two phytopathogenic enterobacteria.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic  enterobacteria capable of facultative anaerobic growth in a wide range of o2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. the transcriptional response to o2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the o2-responsive stimulon. here we present a comparison of transcriptional  profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, grown to mid-log phase in mops minimal medium (0.1% glucose) with and without o2. results: more than 7% of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3-fold changes under anaerobic conditions. in addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the o2 responsive stimulon includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic stimulon of e. coli. we define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. this conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. other components of  the anaerobic stimulon show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between e. coli and the phytopathogens. surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic stimulon between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. there are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between dickeya and pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type vi secretion system (t6ss), suggesting that fine-tuning of the stimulon impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. conclusions: the  small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising  the conserved core transcriptional response to o2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the enterobacteriaceae. our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each  organism using different genes and regulatory strategies.

TI  == lpxc and yafs are the most suitable internal controls to normalize real time rt-qpcr expression in the phytopathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii.
AB  == background: quantitative rt-pcr is the method of choice for studying, with both sensitivity and accuracy, the expression of genes. a reliable normalization of the data, using several reference genes, is critical for an accurate quantification of gene expression. here, we propose a set of reference genes, of  the phytopathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum, which are stable in a wide range of growth conditions. results: we extracted, from a d. dadantii micro-array transcript profile dataset comprising thirty-two different growth conditions, an initial set of 49 expressed genes with very low variation in gene expression. out of these, we retained 10 genes representing different functional categories, different levels of expression (low, medium, and high) and with no systematic variation in expression correlating with growth conditions. we measured the expression of these reference gene candidates using quantitative rt-pcr in 50 different experimental conditions, mimicking the environment encountered by the bacteria in their host and directly during the infection process in planta. the two most stable genes (abf-0017965 (lpxc) and abf-0020529 (yafs) were successfully used for normalization of rt-qpcr data. finally, we demonstrated that the ortholog of lpxc and yafs in pectobacterium atrosepticum also showed stable expression in diverse growth conditions. conclusions: we have identified at least two genes, lpxc (abf-0017965) and yafs (abf-0020509), whose expressions are stable in a wide range of growth conditions  and during infection. thus, these genes are considered suitable for use as reference genes for the normalization of real-time rt-qpcr data of the two main pectinolytic phytopathogenic bacteria d. dadantii and p. atrosepticum and, probably, of other enterobacteriaceae. moreover, we defined general criteria to select good reference genes in bacteria.

TI  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation analysis incorporating genomic organisation, and application to enterobacterial plant pathogens.
AB  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (acgh) provides an estimate of the relative abundance of genomic dna (gdna) taken from comparator and reference organisms by hybridisation to a microarray containing probes that represent sequences from the reference organism. the experimental method is used in a number of biological applications, including the detection of human chromosomal aberrations, and in comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains, but optimisation of the analysis is desirable in each problem domain.we present a method for analysis of bacterial acgh data that encodes spatial information from  the reference genome in a hidden markov model. this technique is the first such method to be validated in comparisons of sequenced bacteria that diverge at the strain and at the genus level: pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 (pba1043) and dickeya dadantii 3937 (dda3937); and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and  l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in all cases our method is found to outperform  common and widely used acgh analysis methods that do not incorporate spatial information. this analysis is applied to comparisons between commercially important plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria (sre) pba1043, p. atrosepticum scri1039, p. carotovorum 193, and dda3937.our analysis indicates that it should not be assumed that hybridisation strength is a reliable proxy for sequence identity in acgh experiments, and robustly extends the applicability of  acgh to bacterial comparisons at the genus level. our results in the sre further  provide evidence for a dynamic, plastic 'accessory' genome, revealing major genomic islands encoding gene products that provide insight into, and may play a  direct role in determining, variation amongst the sre in terms of their environmental survival, host range and aetiology, such as phytotoxin synthesis, multidrug resistance, and nitrogen fixation.

TI  == distinguishing bacterial pathogens of potato using a genome-wide microarray approach.
AB  == a set of 9676 probes was designed for the most harmful bacterial pathogens of potato and tested in a microarray format. gene-specific probes could be designed  for all genes of pectobacterium atrosepticum, c. 50% of the genes of streptomyces scabies and c. 30% of the genes of clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus utilizing the whole-genome sequence information available. for streptomyces turgidiscabies, 226 probes were designed according to the sequences of a pathogenicity island containing important virulence genes. in addition, probes were designed for the virulence-associated nip (necrosis-inducing protein) genes  of p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya dadantii and for the intergenic spacer (igs) sequences of the 16s-23s rrna gene region. ralstonia solanacearum was not included in the study, because it is a quarantine organism and is not presently found in finland, but a few probes were also designed for this species. the probes contained on average 40 target-specific nucleotides and were synthesized on the array in situ, organized as eight sub-arrays with an identical set of probes which could be used for hybridization with different samples. all bacteria were readily distinguished using a single channel system for signal detection. nearly all of the c. 1000 probes designed for c. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, c. 50% and 40% of the c. 4000 probes designed for the genes of s. scabies and p. atrosepticum, respectively, and over 100 probes for s. turgidiscabies showed significant signals only with the respective species. p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya strains were all detected with 110 common probes. by contrast, the strains of these species were found to differ in  their signal profiles. probes targeting the igs region and nip genes could be used to place strains of dickeya to two groups, which correlated with differences in virulence. taken together, the approach of using a custom-designed, genome-wide microarray provided a robust means for distinguishing the bacterial pathogens of potato.

TI  == the response regulator hrpy of dickeya dadantii 3937 regulates virulence genes not linked to the hrp cluster.
AB  == hrpx/y is a putative two-component system (tcs) encoded within the type iii secretion system (t3ss) gene cluster of dickeya dadantii. a linear regulatory cascade initiated by hrpx/y that leads to activation of the downstream t3ss genes via hrps and hrpl was described previously. therefore, in d. dadantii, hrpx/y plays an important role in regulation of genes involved in bacteria-plant interactions and bacterial aggregation via the t3ss. hrpx/y is the only tcs shared among the plant-pathogenic enterobacteria that is not also present in animal-associated enterobacteria. to date, the genes known to be regulated by hrpy are restricted to the hrp and hrc genes and no signal has been identified that triggers hrpy-dependent gene expression. we demonstrated that hrpy interacts with the hrps promoter in vitro. we then used a transposon-based system to isolate previously unidentified hrpy-dependent genes, including genes previously  shown to affect virulence, including kdgm and acsc. hrpy is a dual regulator, positively regulating at least 10 genes in addition to those in the hrp gene cluster and negatively regulating at least 5 genes. the regulatory effect on one  gene depended on the culture medium used. of the 16 hrpy-regulated genes identified in this screen, 14 are not present in pectobacterium atrosepticum, the nearest relative of d. dadantii with a sequenced genome. none of the newly identified hrpy-regulated genes were required for bacterial aggregation; thus, neither acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing nor the rcs signal transduction system which regulates colanic acid, a molecule that plays an important role in biofilm formation in other enterobacteria, are required for d.  dadantii aggregation.

TI  == the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) is a pathogen of the pea aphid.
AB  == dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi) is a phytopathogenic bacterium causing soft rot diseases on many crops. the sequencing of its genome identified four genes encoding homologues of the cyt family of insecticidal toxins from bacillus  thuringiensis, which are not present in the close relative pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum. the pathogenicity of d. dadantii was tested on the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, and the bacterium was shown to be highly virulent for this insect, either by septic injury or by oral infection. the lethal inoculum dose was calculated to be as low as 10 ingested bacterial cells.  a d. dadantii mutant with the four cytotoxin genes deleted showed a reduced per os virulence for a. pisum, highlighting the potential role of at least one of these genes in pathogenicity. since only one bacterial pathogen of aphids has been previously described (erwinia aphidicola), other species from the same bacterial group were tested. the pathogenic trait for aphids was shown to be widespread, albeit variable, within the phytopathogens, with no link to phylogenetic positioning in the enterobacteriaceae. previously characterized gut  symbionts from thrips (erwinia/pantoea group) were also highly pathogenic to the  aphid, whereas the potent entomopathogen photorhabdus luminescens was not. d. dadantii is not a generalist insect pathogen, since it has low pathogenicity for  three other insect species (drosophila melanogaster, sitophilus oryzae, and spodoptera littoralis). d. dadantii was one of the most virulent aphid pathogens  in our screening, and it was active on most aphid instars, except for the first one, probably due to anatomical filtering. the observed difference in virulence toward apterous and winged aphids may have an ecological impact, and this deserves specific attention in future research.
