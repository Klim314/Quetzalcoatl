comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.
