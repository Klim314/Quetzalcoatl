TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == low cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42 in patients with acute bacterial meningitis and normalization after treatment.
AB  == csf-a beta 42 may be a marker of alzheimer's disease (ad). a decreased level of csf-a beta 42 is consistently found in ad and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. however, low csf-a beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance creutzfeldt-jakob disease. to examine if the level of a beta 42 in csf is related to inflammatory processes, we studied csf-a beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and  18 age-matched controls. in acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, p<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. after successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level increased (p<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). the decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing  volumes of serum did not influence the csf-a beta 42 levels. our findings suggest that the reduction in csf-a beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. the cause may be disturbance of the clearance of a beta 42 from the brain.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
