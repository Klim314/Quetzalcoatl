TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) for identification of streptococcus species.
AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
