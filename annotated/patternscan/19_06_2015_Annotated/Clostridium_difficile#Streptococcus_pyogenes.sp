TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of staphylococcus aureus sortase.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is the most frequent cause of  hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of mrsa infection with antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as clostridium difficile infection. sortase a is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of s. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to  cause bacteremia or sepsis in mice. here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor structure to identify 3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazo le and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. sortase inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice  against lethal s. aureus bacteremia. thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective therapy to prevent hospital-acquired s. aureus infection in high-risk patients without the side effects of antibiotics.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == antibiotic optimization and chemical structure stabilization of thiomuracin a.
AB  == synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin a (1) were initiated to improve chemical stability and physicochemical properties. functional group modifications of 1 included removing the c2-c7 side chain, derivatizing the c84 epoxide region, and altering the c44 hydroxyphenylalanine motif. the resulting derivatives simplified and stabilized the chemical structure and were evaluated for antibacterial activity relative to 1. the simplified structure and improved organic solubility of the derivatives facilitated isolation yields from fermentation broths and simplified the procedures involved  for the process. these advancements increased material supply for continued medicinal chemistry optimization and culminated in the identification of 2, a structurally simplified and chemically stable analogue of 1 which retained potent antibiotic activity.

TI  == discovery of lff571: an investigational agent for clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. this results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of c. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product ge2270 a (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of c. difficile infection. the medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models  of infection were characterized. these studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of lff571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating c. difficile infection.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of lff571 against clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of lff571, a novel analog of ge2270a that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. lff571 possesses potent activity against c. difficile and most other gram-positive anaerobes (mic(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. the mic(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable  activity against gram-positive organisms: mic(90)s against c. difficile, clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125  mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against clostridium ramosum and clostridium  innocuum. mic(90) for s. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. lff571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == [the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases].
AB  == the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases has a long tradition. initially immunoglobulins from hyperimmunised animals were used for their antitoxic and antimicrobial activity. the development of preparations of human intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) and the observations of their long-term use enabled to assess their usefulness in the treatment of the diseases of proven or probable infectious etiology. in the treatment of infectious diseases ivig are currently used as immunomodulating drugs or immunosuppressive therapy, more frequently than the specific antibodies against the viruses, bacteria or their toxins. in practice of the infectious ward ivig are used as a drug of choice in the treatment of kawasaki disease, in toxic epidermolysis and stevens-johnson syndrome. as adjunctive therapy ivig are used in the infection with parvovirus b19, in hemophagocytic syndrome, for treatment of infections presenting with a severe toxemia caused by clostridium difficile, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the rationale for the use of ivig may be also serious infections caused by enteroviruses, particularly neuroinfections. the use of ivig in the treatment of sepsis is controversial, since their effectiveness is not proven.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a serotype 11a, st62 streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (sch) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated  against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. everninomicin showed  the highest activity against the species tested and mics90% of everninomicin against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  enterococcus faecium and clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. mics90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) were 0.78 microgram/ml. laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in  strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very  slow rate. post-antibiotic effect against strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. adherence to glass surface of an mrsa strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub mic of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == comparison of oral cefpodoxime proxetil and penicillin v potassium in the treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis. the cefpodoxime pharyngitis study group.
AB  == ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis due to streptococcus pyogenes were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of cefpodoxime proxetil orally with food every 12 hours or 250 mg of penicillin v potassium orally on an empty stomach every six hours. treatment efficacy was evaluated in 30 cefpodoxime-treated and 33 penicillin-treated patients. after 10 days of treatment, s pyogenes was eradicated from the throat culture in 29 of the 30 cefpodoxime-treated patients and in 30 of the 33 penicillin-treated patients. twenty days after treatment termination, infection recurred in one patient of each treatment group. clinical cure or improvement was found in 97% of the patients in each group. adverse medical events occurred in nine of the 48 cefpodoxime-treated patients and in four of the 45 penicillin-treated patients; these were probably related to the study drug in seven and two patients, respectively. the most common adverse events were nausea (in three cefpodoxime and one penicillin patient) and diarrhea (in three and two). no patient showed colitis related to clostridium difficile. no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results were found in either treatment group. it is concluded that cefpodoxime proxetil is as effective and safe as penicillin v potassium in the treatment of pharyngitis due to s pyogenes.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == in vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  == flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. in comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against haemophilus influenzae. flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against clostridium difficile. the activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin bmy-28100.
AB  == bmy-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against staphylococcus  aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium difficile. bmy-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative bacteria, bmy-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100, including bactericidal activity, against staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. bmy-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

TI  == further experience with augmentin in the treatment of skin infections.
AB  == thirty-two patients with skin infections were treated with augmentin, a combination of amoxycillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. these infections were primary skin sepsis (7), infected eczema (11), infected trauma (10) and leg ulcers (4). the majority of cases were caused by amoxycillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus either alone or in combination with streptococcus pyogenes. thirty patients (94%) responded to treatment with only one withdrawal (for side effects). side effects were limited to nausea (9%) diarrhoea (9%) and rash (3%). no patient with diarrhoea showed evidence of clostridium difficile toxin production in the stools. augmentin appears to be a safe, useful, effective antibiotic for the treatment of skin infections in general practice and in hospital. it may prove of particular value when mixed infections of penicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes are present.
