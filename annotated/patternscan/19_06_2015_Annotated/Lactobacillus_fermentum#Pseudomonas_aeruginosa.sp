TI  == screening of lactobacillus spp. for the prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections.
AB  == background: pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that significantly increases morbidity and mortality in nosocomial infections and cystic fibrosis patients. its pathogenicity especially relies on the production of virulence factors or resistances to many antibiotics. since multiplication of  antibiotic resistance can lead to therapeutic impasses, it becomes necessary to develop new tools for fighting p. aeruginosa infections. the use of probiotics is one of the ways currently being explored. probiotics are microorganisms that exert a positive effect on the host's health and some of them are known to possess antibacterial activities. since most of their effects have been shown in  the digestive tract, experimental data compatible with the respiratory environment are strongly needed. the main goal of this study was then to test the capacity of lactobacilli to inhibit major virulence factors (elastolytic activity and biofilm formation) associated with p. aeruginosa pathogenicity. results: sixty-seven lactobacilli were isolated from the oral cavities of healthy volunteers. these isolates together with 20 lactobacilli isolated from raw milks, were tested for their capacity to decrease biofilm formation and activity of the  elastase produced by p. aeruginosa pao1. ten isolates, particularly efficient, were accurately identified using a polyphasic approach (api 50 chl, mass-spectrometry and 16s/rpoa/phes genes sequencing) and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). the 8 remaining strains belonging to the l. fermentum (6), l. zeae (1) and l. paracasei (1) species were sensitive to all antibiotics tested with the exception of the intrinsic resistance to vancomycin. the strains  were all able to grow in artificial saliva. conclusion: eight strains belonging to l. fermentum, l. zeae and l. paracasei species harbouring anti-elastase and anti-biofilm properties are potential probiotics for fighting p. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. however, further studies are needed in order to test their  innocuity and their capacity to behave such as an oropharyngeal barrier against pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in vivo.

TI  == aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  == liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of aureobasidium pullulans. the aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. nine  strains of a. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in thailand. strains rsu 9, rsu 21, and rsu 29, all from clade  11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. these are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. these strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. the structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. liamocins from a. pullulans strains rsu 9 and rsu 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (ic50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal  cell line. liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of enterococcus faecalis, but did  not inhibit strains of lactobacillus fermentum, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, a. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == anti-infective properties of lactobacillus fermentum against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == surgical wounds and implant-associated staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because of limited susceptibility of several of these strains to conventional antibiotics. as a result, there is a constant need for new alternative drugs. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of lactobacillus fermentum, a probiotic bacterium, which we have isolated from colonic biopsies. the inhibition of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa growth was evaluated by coincubating with l. fermentum strains. growth inhibition was tested for several of their clinical isolates using agar well diffusion assays. for biofilm assay s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were grown on the glass slides and in 96-well plates in presence of 2.5 mug/ml culture filtrate of l. fermentum. biofilms were photographed using confocal microscope or stained with 0.1% crystal violet. reduction in the cytotoxicity of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa was observed in presence of 2.5 mug/ml l. fermentum-spent media. using in vitroexperiments, we showed that l. fermentum-secreted compound(s) inhibits the growth, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of several s. aureus and p. aeruginosa strains. compound(s) present in  the culture supernatant of l. fermentum may have promising applications in treating hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == activity of cecropin p1 and fa-ll-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == protective effect of lipoteichoic acid from lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum against pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) from lactobacillus casei yit 9018 or lactobacillus fermentum yit 0159 augmented the resistance of c57bl/6 mice to infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa, but conferred no resistance to listeria monocytogenes. it is suggested that lta was unable to activate macrophages.
