TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == immune status, antibiotic medication and ph are associated with changes in the stomach fluid microbiota.
AB  == the stomach acts as a barrier to ingested microbes, thereby influencing the microbial ecology of the entire gastrointestinal (gi) tract. the stomach microbiota and the role of human host and environmental factors, such as health status or medications, in shaping its composition remain largely unknown. we sought to characterize the bacterial and fungal microbiota in the stomach fluid in order to gain insights into the role of the stomach in gi homeostasis. gastric fluid was collected from 25 patients undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy. dna isolates were used for pcr amplification of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers (its). rna isolates were used for 16s rrna cdna generation and subsequent pcr amplification. while all stomach fluid samples are dominated by the phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria and fusobacteria (>99% of sequence  reads), the transcriptionally active microbiota shows significant reduction in actinobacteria (34%) and increase in campylobacter (444%) (p<0.003), specifically the oral commensal and suspected intestinal pathogen campylobacter concisus. bacterial but not fungal diversity is reduced by antibiotic treatment (28%; p<0.02), immunosuppression in transplant recipients and hiv/aids patients (42%; p<0.001) and gastric fluid ph >4 (70%; p<0.05). immunosuppression correlates with decreased abundance of prevotella (24%), fusobacterium (2%) and leptotrichia (6%) and increased abundance of lactobacillus (3844%) (p<0.003). we have generated the first in-depth characterization of the human gastric fluid microbiota, using bacterial 16s rrna gene and transcript, and fungal its amplicon sequencing and provide evidence for a significant impact of the host immune status on its composition with likely consequences for human health.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == atypical structure of the 23s ribosomal rna molecule in certain oral bacteria.
AB  == ribosomal rna (rrna) isolated from wolinella recta and seven related bacteria was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. the 23s rrna molecule could not be detected in w. recta, wolinella curva, bacteroides gracilis, or bacteroides ureolyticus. in place of the 23s molecule, there were three smaller molecules of  approximately 1700, 650, and 600 bases designated 23s alpha, 23s beta, and 23s delta, respectively. an intact 23s rrna molecule could be isolated from wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter concisus, and campylobacter sputorum. the cleavage sites of the w. recta 23s rrna molecule were located by direct rna sequence analysis and were found to be in similar locations, nucleotides 546 and 1180, as  cleavage sites described in other prokaryotes. the presence or absence of the 23s rrna molecule may be a useful marker for these micro-organisms.

TI  == characterization of wolinella spp., campylobacter concisus, bacteroides gracilis, and eikenella corrodens by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the small asaccharolytic, nonpigmenting gram-negative rods of the human oral cavity are difficult to differentiate from each other. protein profiles of sonicated cells of wolinella species, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides gracilis, and eikenella corrodens were obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with a silver stain. the gels were scanned with a laser densitometer, and the similarity of strains was computed by determining correlation coefficients of normalized densities along the gels. the strains were grouped by cluster analysis of the correlation coefficients. all species were distinct from each other. several groups were found within e. corrodens. a colored silver stain was found to highlight species  differences and appears to be useful in the rapid identification of fresh isolates.

TI  == api zym and api an-ident reactions of fastidious oral gram-negative species.
AB  == api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests were done on six oral species  which are difficult to characterize with conventional biochemical tests. "bacteroides forsythus, the "fusiform" bacteroides species (a. c. r. tanner, m. a. listgarten, m. n. strzempko, and j. l. ebersole, manuscript in preparation), is difficult to cultivate in broth media, yet it gave 15 positive tests in these  series. the tests were able to separate this new species from species of capnocytophaga and fusobacterium. "b. forsythus" reactions were similar but not identical to those of reference bacteroides species. positive reactions for alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and alpha-glucuronidase suggest that "b. forsythus" may be saccharolytic. it was the only species tested  which was trypsin positive. wolinella species, campylobacter concisus, b. gracilis, and eikenella corrodens are asaccharolytic, and characterization relies heavily on sensitivities to inhibitory agents. these species reacted weakly in the api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests, and the reactions were not useful for separating these species. the enzyme reactions differentiated wolinella recta and c. concisus from selenomonas sputigena, another oral motile but saccharolytic organism.

TI  == effect of subgingival scaling on systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms.
AB  == the effects of scaling and root planing treatment on systemic antibody responses  were studied in patients with periodontal disease and in normal subjects. immunoglobulin g antibody in serum to a battery of oral microorganisms was assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after treatment in 31 individuals. the majority (96%) of the diseased patients exhibited elevated antibody to one or more of the microorganisms before the scaling regime. significant increases in antibody levels in serum were noted in 16 of 19 patients after scaling, whereas only 2 of 12 nonscaled subjects showed similar changes during monitoring intervals of up to 3 years. the bacterial specificities of the  increases were found to differ among the patients; however, a significant correlation to preexisting elevated antibody levels was observed. peak levels of  responses were noted at approximately 2 to 4 months posttreatment; antibody returned to pretreatment levels by 8 to 12 months. the predominant organisms for  which changes were noted included the black-pigmented bacteroides spp., eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in 18 of 19 instances, the homologous microorganism was detected in the subgingival  plaque when elevated antibody was present after treatment. these findings indicated that specific changes in host systemic responses accompany scaling and  root planing treatment of periodontal disease patients. these alterations in the  host response may provide an additional means by which successful therapy can be  accomplished.

TI  == taxonomy of anaerobes: present state of the art.
AB  == results of nucleic acid studies, which indicate relationships among strains and species more clearly than do usual phenotypic tests, have led to new bacteriologic nomenclature. some major changes in bacteroides include the recognition of three species (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides denticola, and bacteroides loescheii) formerly grouped in b. melaninogenicus subspecies melaninogenicus; two species (bacteroides intermedius with two closely related homology groups and bacteroides corporis) formerly grouped together as b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius; and two species (bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oris) formerly thought to be human isolates of bacteroides ruminicola subspecies brevis. former subspecies of bacteroides fragilis have been elevated to species rank; and bacteroides uniformis and an unnamed group ("3452a"), recognized. a new genus, capnocytophaga, with three species, is composed of strains formerly classified as bacteroides ochraceus or centers for disease control (cdc) group df-1. strains previously thought to be human isolates of "vibrio succinogenes" and related organisms that derive energy by reduction of fumarate or nitrate with formate or hydrogen have been reclassified in bacteroides (bacteroides gracilis), campylobacter (campylobacter concisus), or in a new genus, wolinella.
