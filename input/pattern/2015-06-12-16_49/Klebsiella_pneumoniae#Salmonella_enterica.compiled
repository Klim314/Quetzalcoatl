TI  - Differentiation of IncL and IncM Plasmids Associated with the Spread of Clinically Relevant Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: blaOXA-48, blaNDM-1 and blaCTX-M-3 are clinically relevant resistance genes, frequently associated with the broad-host range plasmids of the IncL/M group. The L and M plasmids belong to two compatible groups, which were incorrectly classified together by molecular methods. In order to understand their evolution, we fully sequenced four IncL/M plasmids, including the reference plasmids R471 and R69, the recently described blaOXA-48-carrying plasmid pKPN-El.Nr7 from a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Bern (Switzerland), and the blaSHV-5 carrying plasmid p202c from a Salmonella enterica from Tirana (Albania). METHODS: Sequencing was performed using 454 Junior Genome Sequencer (Roche). Annotation was performed using Sequin and Artemis software. Plasmid sequences were compared with 13 fully sequenced plasmids belonging to the IncL/M group available in GenBank. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of plasmid genomes revealed two distinct genetic lineages, each containing one of the R471 (IncL) and R69 (IncM) reference plasmids. Conjugation experiments demonstrated that plasmids representative of the IncL and IncM groups were compatible with each other. The IncL group is constituted by the blaOXA-48-carrying plasmids and R471. The IncM group contains two sub-types of plasmids named IncM1 and IncM2 that are each incompatible. CONCLUSION: This work re-defines the structure of the IncL and IncM families and ascribes a definitive designation to the fully sequenced IncL/M plasmids available in GenBank.
TI  - Removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. The antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. Here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of copper sulfate (CuSO4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. Simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic E. coli. In addition, preformed biofilms of E. coli C, Salmonella Typhimurium, K. pneumoniae, and Salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/L NaClO, 0.1 mmol/L CuSO4, and 350 mmol/L H2O2 for 5 min. Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in NaClO concentration, and the E. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. The application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.
TI  - [Periplasmic lysozime inhibitior PliC and its role in antilysozime activity of enterobacteria].
AB  - Two families of specific inhibitors of type C lysozyme (Ivy and PliC) secreted from the periplasmic space are known in enterobacteria. Microbial capacity for distant lysozyme inactivation (antilysozyme activity) is most pronounced in the strains and species carrying homologues of the pliCgene. The pliC homologue localized in a -200-kbp megaplasmid of Klebsiella pneumoniae was shown to differ significantly in the amino acid composition of the coded polypeptide. Similar to the Salmonella enterica pliC homologue, it possesses a detachable signal part and contains identical functionally critical amino acids of the active center of the inhibitor. Antilysozyme activity of the pliC-positive K. pneumoniae strains was observed at the level corresponding to the highest values found inpliC-positive S. enterica. High level of the antilysozyme activity in K. pneumoniae strains containing the plasmid pliC homologue was found in all studied strains, unlike S. enterica strains carrying the known chromosomal pliC homologue.
TI  - Development of a protocol for predicting bacterial resistance to microbicides.
AB  - Regulations dealing with microbicides in Europe and the United States are evolving and now require data on the risk of the development of resistance in organisms targeted by microbicidal products. There is no standard protocol to assess the risk of the development of resistance to microbicidal formulations. This study aimed to validate the use of changes in microbicide and antibiotic susceptibility as initial markers for predicting microbicide resistance and cross-resistance to antibiotics. Three industrial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (SL1344 and 14028S) were exposed to a shampoo, a mouthwash, eye makeup remover, and the microbicides contained within these formulations (chlorhexidine digluconate [CHG] and benzalkonium chloride [BZC]) under realistic, in-use conditions. Baseline and postexposure data were compared. No significant increases in the MIC or the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were observed for any strain after exposure to the three formulations. Increases as high as 100-fold in the MICs and MBCs of CHG and BZC for SL1344 and 14028S were observed but were unstable. Changes in antibiotic susceptibility were not clinically significant. The use of MICs and MBCs combined with antibiotic susceptibility profiling and stability testing generated reproducible data that allowed for an initial prediction of the development of resistance to microbicides. These approaches measure characteristics that are directly relevant to the concern over resistance and cross-resistance development following the use of microbicides. These are low-cost, high-throughput techniques, allowing manufacturers to provide to regulatory bodies, promptly and efficiently, data supporting an early assessment of the risk of resistance development.
TI  - Partition locus-based classification of selected plasmids in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica spp.: an additional tool.
AB  - The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae has been largely attributed to plasmids, circular DNA molecules capable of autonomous replication. Whereas high-copy-number plasmids primarily rely on passive diffusion for plasmid maintenance, low-copy-number plasmids utilize so-called partition (par) systems. Plasmid partition relies on three structures, i.e. a centromere like DNA site, a centromere-binding protein and an ATPase or a GTPase motor protein for plasmid positioning. Identification and classification of plasmids is essential for tracing plasmids conferring drug resistance. PCR-based replicon typing is currently the standard method for plasmid identification but there are new classification schemes, especially the relaxase gene typing (PRaseT). Here we developed a multiplex PCR set targeting par loci found on the plasmids most frequently encountered in Enterobacteriaceae. This method, called "plasmid partition gene typing" (PAR-T), was validated with 136 transconjugants or transformants harboring various replicon types. The method was tested with 30 multidrug-resistant clinical isolates including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica carrying 1-4 replicons; all replicons were tested in parallel with PRaseT for comparison. Six multiplex PCRs and one simplex PCR including 18 pairs of primers recognized plasmids of groups IncA/C, FIA, FIB, FIC, FIIk, FII, HI1, HI2, I1, L/M, N, X. Our set of multiplex PCRs showed high specificity for the classification of resistance plasmids except for IncX replicons.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Identification of antigenic proteins of the nosocomial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.
TI  - A novel, broad-range, CTXPhi-derived stable integrative expression vector for functional studies.
AB  - CTXPhi, a filamentous vibriophage encoding cholera toxin, uses a unique strategy  for its lysogeny. The single-stranded phage genome forms intramolecular base-pairing interactions between two inversely oriented XerC and XerD binding sites (XBS) and generates a functional phage attachment site, attP(+), for integration. The attP(+) structure is recognized by the host-encoded tyrosine recombinases XerC and XerD (XerCD), which enables irreversible integration of CTXPhi into the chromosome dimer resolution site (dif) of Vibrio cholerae. The dif site and the XerCD recombinases are widely conserved in bacteria. We took advantage of these conserved attributes to develop a broad-host-range integrative expression vector that could irreversibly integrate into the host chromosome using XerCD recombinases without altering the function of any known open reading frame (ORF). In this study, we engineered two different arabinose-inducible expression vectors, pBD62 and pBD66, using XBS of CTXPhi. pBD62 replicates conditionally and integrates efficiently into the dif of the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination using host-encoded XerCD recombinases. The expression level of the gene of interest could be controlled through the PBAD promoter by modulating the functions of the vector-encoded transcriptional factor AraC. We validated the irreversible integration of pBD62 into a wide range of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, such as V. cholerae, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gene expression from the PBAD promoter of integrated vectors was confirmed in V. cholerae using the well-studied reporter genes mCherry, eGFP, and lacZ.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - C-terminal domain swapping of SSB changes the size of the ssDNA binding site.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) plays an important role in DNA metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination, and is therefore essential for cell survival. Bacterial SSB consists of an N-terminal ssDNA-binding/oligomerization domain and a flexible C-terminal protein-protein interaction domain. We characterized the ssDNA-binding properties of Klebsiella pneumoniae SSB (KpSSB), Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 SSB (StSSB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 SSB (PaSSB), and two chimeric KpSSB proteins, namely, KpSSBnStSSBc and KpSSBnPaSSBc. The C-terminal domain of StSSB or PaSSB was exchanged with that of KpSSB through protein chimeragenesis. By using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we characterized the stoichiometry of KpSSB, StSSB, PaSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc, complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers. The binding site sizes were determined to be 26 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, 29 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, and 29 +/- 2 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Comparison of the binding site sizes of KpSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc showed that the C-terminal domain swapping of SSB changes the size of the binding site. Our observations suggest that not only the conserved N-terminal domain but also the C-terminal domain of SSB is an important determinant for ssDNA binding.
TI  - Evaluation of Gram-negative bacterial infection by a stable and conjugative bioluminescence plasmid in a mouse model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The green fluorescence protein (GFP)-associated fluorescence method and the luciferase-associated bioluminescence method are the two major methods for IVIS imaging system to investigate the bacterial infection in animal models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the infection route of Gram-negative bacteria carrying a stable and broad range of conjugative bioluminescence plasmid pSE-Lux1 in a mouse model. RESULTS: Both encapsulated and non-encapsulated Gram-negative bacteria were used as hosts to evaluate conjugation efficiency and plasmid stability of pSE-Lux1, a recombinant of pSE34 and luxABCDE operon. The plasmid conjugation efficiencies of pSE-Lux1 ranged from 10(-)(3) to 10(-)(7) in various Gram-negative bacteria. Plasmid pSE-Lux1 maintained in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella enterica serovars Choleraesues (abbreviated S. Choleraesuis) and Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), than in Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marcescens, was shown to be of better stability for at least four days. To investigate systemic bacterial infections, K. pneumoniae strain CG354 was intravenously injected, and then was clearly observed to be non-pathogenic to Balb/c mice for a long-term bioluminescence monitoring for 6 days. For examining dynamic distributions of gastrointestinal tract infection, the invasion protein SipB-deficient mutant OU5045 big up tri, opensipB and OU5046 big up tri, opensipB of S. serovar Typhimurium constructed in this study, compared to wild-type strain OU5045 and its virulence plasmid-less strain OU5046, were of less virulence to mice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the conjugative and stable bioluminescence vehicle system of pSE-Lux1 in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, a system that can provide a useful reporter approach to trace systemic and gastrointestinal bacterial infections in a mouse model.
TI  - Lethal synergy involving bicyclomycin: an approach for reviving old antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One way to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance is to revive old compounds that may have intrinsic lethal activity that is obscured by protective factors. Bicyclomycin is an old inhibitor of the Rho transcription terminator that by itself shows little rapid lethal activity. However, bicyclomycin participates in bacteriostatic synergy, which raises the possibility that conditions for lethal synergy may exist, perhaps through a suppression of protective factors. METHODS: Bicyclomycin was combined with bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression, and bactericidal activity was measured with several cultured Gram-negative pathogens. RESULTS: When used alone, bicyclomycin failed to rapidly kill growing cultures of Escherichia coli; however, the additional presence of bacteriostatic concentrations of tetracycline, chloramphenicol or rifampicin led to rapid killing. Four other pathogen species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Shigella dysenteriae, also exhibited enhanced killing when bicyclomycin was combined with tetracycline or rifampicin. This lethal synergy was achieved at low concentrations (slightly above the MIC) for all agents tested in combinations. Follow-up work with E. coli indicated that lethal synergy arose from a blockage of transcription elongation. Moreover, lethal synergy was reduced when bicyclomycin was added 60 min before tetracycline, suggesting that bicyclomycin induces a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: The action of bicyclomycin illustrates the potential present in a largely abandoned antibacterial agent; it exhibits lethal synergy when coadministered with known, bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression. The identification of protective factors, which are currently uncharacterized, may reveal new ways to promote the lethal action of some old antibiotics.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - High prevalence of blaCTX-M-1/IncI1/ST3 and blaCMY-2/IncI1/ST2 plasmids in healthy urban dogs in France.
AB  - In the community, close contacts between humans and dogs may promote the transfer of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/plasmidic AmpC cephalosporinase (ESBL/pAmpC) genes. Large-scale prevalence studies on ESBL/pAmpC carriage in dogs are rare, and data on ESBL/pAmpC plasmids are even more limited. Here, a considerable rate of 18.5% ESBL/pAmpC carriers was found among 368 unrelated healthy dogs in Paris, France. This prevalence is much higher than the one found in healthy humans in the same city (6%) but close to that recently reported in dogs in China (24.5%). All isolates were identified as Escherichia coli, except one Salmonella enterica and one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate. The sequence type 131 (ST131) clone was rare (2/73 isolates). Interestingly, two plasmids (blaCTX-M-1/IncI1/ST3 and blaCMY-2/IncI1/ST2) were unexpectedly highly predominant, raising the question of their successful spread. Considering that CTX-M-1 was recently found to be equally as abundant as CTX-M-15 in healthy Parisian subjects, the question of dogs being a CTX-M-1 reservoir for humans is open. Such a high prevalence of the blaCMY-2/IncI1/ST2 plasmid may result from the use of cephalexin in veterinary medicine, as previously demonstrated experimentally. In all, our study points out healthy urban dogs as a potential source of ESBL/pAmpC genes that can further disseminate to the human community.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - GIL, a new c-di-GMP-binding protein domain involved in regulation of cellulose synthesis in enterobacteria.
AB  - In contrast to numerous enzymes involved in c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation in enterobacteria, only a handful of c-di-GMP receptors/effectors have been identified. In search of new c-di-GMP receptors, we screened the Escherichia coli ASKA overexpression gene library using the Differential Radial Capillary Action of Ligand Assay (DRaCALA) with fluorescently and radioisotope-labelled c-di-GMP. We uncovered three new candidate c-di-GMP receptors in E. coli and characterized one of them, BcsE. The bcsE gene is encoded in cellulose synthase operons in representatives of Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. The purified BcsE proteins from E. coli, Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae bind c-di-GMP via the domain of unknown function, DUF2819, which is hereby designated GIL, GGDEF I-site like domain. The RxGD motif of the GIL domain is required for c-di-GMP binding, similar to the c-di-GMP-binding I-site of the diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain. Thus, GIL is the second protein domain, after PilZ, dedicated to c-di-GMP-binding. We show that in S. enterica, BcsE is not essential for cellulose synthesis but is required for maximal cellulose production, and that c-di-GMP binding is critical for BcsE function. It appears that cellulose production in enterobacteria is controlled by a two-tiered c-di-GMP-dependent system involving BcsE and the PilZ domain containing glycosyltransferase BcsA.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a CTX-M-1 IncI1 plasmid found in Salmonella 4,5,12:i:-, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae on a UK pig farm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2009, CTX-M Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella isolates were recovered from a UK pig farm, prompting studies into the dissemination of the resistance and to establish any relationships between the isolates. METHODS: PFGE was used to elucidate clonal relationships between isolates whilst plasmid profiling, restriction analysis, sequencing and PCR were used to characterize the CTX-M-harbouring plasmids. RESULTS: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella 4,5,12:i:- and Bovismorbificans resistant to cefotaxime (n = 65) were recovered and 63 were shown by PCR to harbour a group 1 CTX-M gene. The harbouring hosts were diverse, but the group 1 CTX-M plasmids were common. Three sequenced CTX-M plasmids from E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serotype 4,5,12:i:- were identical except for seven mutations and highly similar to IncI1 plasmid ColIb-P9. Two antimicrobial resistance regions were identified: one inserted upstream of yacABC harbouring ISCR2 transposases, sul2 and floR; and the other inserted within shfB of the pilV shufflon harbouring the ISEcp1 transposase followed by blaCTX-M-1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that an ST108 IncI1 plasmid encoding a blaCTX-M-1 gene had disseminated across multiple genera on this farm, an example of horizontal gene transfer of the blaCTX-M-1 gene.
TI  - Species-selective killing of bacteria by antimicrobial peptide-PNAs.
AB  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobials kill indiscriminately, a property that can lead to  negative clinical consequences and an increase in the incidence of resistance. Species-specific antimicrobials that could selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without targeting other species in the microbiome could limit these problems. The pathogen genome presents an excellent target for the development of such antimicrobials. In this study we report the design and evaluation of species-selective peptide nucleic acid (PNA) antibacterials. Selective growth inhibition of B. subtilis, E. coli, K. pnuemoniae and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in axenic or mixed culture could be achieved with PNAs that exploit species differences in the translation initiation region of essential genes. An S. Typhimurium-specific PNA targeting ftsZ resulted in elongated cells that were not observed in E. coli, providing phenotypic evidence of the selectivity of PNA-based antimicrobials. Analysis of the genomes of E. coli and S. Typhimurium gave a conservative estimate of >150 PNA targets that could potentially discriminate between these two closely related species. This work provides a basis for the development of a new class of antimicrobial with a tuneable spectrum of activity.
TI  - Allantoinase and dihydroorotase binding and inhibition by flavonols and the substrates of cyclic amidohydrolases.
AB  - Allantoinase and dihydroorotase are members of the cyclic amidohydrolases family. Allantoinase and dihydroorotase possess very similar binuclear metal centers in the active site and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. However, whether the substrate specificities of allantoinase and dihydroorotase overlap and whether the substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases inhibit allantoinase and dihydroorotase remain unknown. In this study, the binding and inhibition of allantoinase (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2) and dihydroorotase (Klebsiella pneumoniae) by flavonols and the substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases were investigated. Hydantoin and phthalimide, substrates of hydantoinase and imidase, were not hydrolyzed by allantoinase and dihydroorotase. Hydantoin and dihydroorotate competitively inhibited allantoinase, whereas hydantoin and allantoin bind to dihydroorotase, but do not affect its activity. We further investigated the effects of the flavonols myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin, on the inhibition of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. Allantoinase and dihydroorotase were both significantly inhibited by kaempferol, with IC50 values of 35 +/- 3 muM and 31 +/- 2 muM, respectively. Myricetin strongly inhibited dihydroorotase, with an IC50 of 40 +/- 1 muM. The double reciprocal of the Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that kaempferol was a competitive inhibitor for allantoinase but an uncompetitive inhibitor for dihydroorotase. A structural study using PatchDock showed that kaempferol was docked in the active site pocket of allantoinase but outside the active site pocket of dihydroorotase. These results constituted a first study that naturally occurring product flavonols inhibit the cyclic amidohydrolases, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude). Thus, flavonols may serve as drug leads for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases.
TI  - Liquid based formulations of bacteriophages for the management of waterborne bacterial pathogens in water microcosms.
AB  - Water resources are contaminated by life-threatening multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria. Unfortunately, these pathogenic bacteria do not respond to the traditional water purification methods. Therefore, there is a need of environmentally friendly strategies to overcome the problems associated with the antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens. In the present study, highly potent lytic phages against multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from the Pavana river water. They belonged to the Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families. These phages were purified and enriched in the laboratory. Monovalent formulations of phiSPB, BVPaP-3 and KPP phages were prepared in three different liquids viz., phage broth, saline and distilled water. The phages were stable for almost 8-10 months in the phage broth at 4 degrees C. The stability of the phages in saline and distilled water was 5-6 months at 4 degrees C. All of the phages were stable only for 4-6 months in the phage broth at 30 degrees C. The monovalent phage formulation of psiSPB was applied at MOI < 1, as disinfectant against an exponential and stationary phase cells of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B in various water microcosms. The results indicated that there was almost 80 % reduction in the log phase cells of Salmonella serovar Paratyphi B in 24 h. In stationary phase cells, the reduction was comparatively less within same period. At the same time, there was concomitant increase in the phage population by 80% in all the microcosms indicating that psiSPB phage is highly potent in killing pathogen in water. Results strongly support that the formulation of psiSPB in the phage broth in monovalent form could be used as an effective biological disinfectant for preventing transmission of water-borne bacterial pathogens, including antimicrobial resistant ones.
TI  - Targeting relaxase genes for classification of the predominant plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Plasmids are the main vectors of antimicrobial drug resistance and virulence genes, especially in Enterobacteriaceae. Identification and classification of plasmids is essential for analysis of their distribution. The most widely used typing method is PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). A new classification scheme based on relaxase gene typing has been described recently. We propose a practical application of this method, with the development of a multiplex PCR set targeting relaxase genes found on plasmids most frequently encountered in Enterobacteriaceae. This method, here called "plasmid relaxase gene typing" (PRaseT), was validated with 60 transconjugants and transformants harboring various replicon types. The method was tested with 39 multidrug-resistant clinical isolates including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica carrying 1-7 replicons as well as with 17 plasmids non-typeable using PBRT; all replicons were tested in parallel with PBRT for comparison. Six multiplex PCRs and one simplex PCR, including 24 pairs of primers, recognized plasmids of groups A/C, B/O, colE, FIA, FIB, FIC, FV, FIIk, HI1, HI2, I1, K, L/M, N, P1alpha, Q1, U, W, X1, X2, X3 and X4. There was perfect correlation between PRaseT and PBRT results in 31/39 (79.5%) clinical isolates. Moreover, 11/17 (64.7%) plasmids non-typeable by PBRT could be typed by PRaseT. Our set of multiplex PCRs showed high sensitivity and specificity for the classification of resistance plasmids. It has proved complementary to the widely used PBRT and will improve the monitoring of plasmid distribution in every-day practice.
TI  - Investigation of the antibacterial activity of a short cationic peptide against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium strains and its cytotoxicity on eukaryotic cells.
AB  - With the growing microbial resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents, the development of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies are vital. During recent years novel peptide antibiotics with broad spectrum activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been developed. In this study, antibacterial activity of CM11 peptide (WKLFKKILKVL-NH2), a short cecropin-melittin hybrid peptide, is evaluated against antibiotic-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium as two important pathogenic bacteria. To appraise the antibacterial activity, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and bactericidal killing assay were utilized with different concentrations (2-128 mg/L) of peptide. To evaluate cytotoxic effect of peptide, viability of RAJI, Hela, SP2/0, CHO, LNCAP cell lines and primary murine macrophage cells were also investigated with MTT assay in different concentrations (3-24 and 0.5-16 mg/L, respectively). MICs of K. pneumoniae and S. typhimurium isolates were in range of 8-16 and 4-16 mg/L, respectively. In bactericidal killing assay no colonies were observed at 2X MIC for K. pneumoniae and S. typhimurium isolates after 80-90 min, respectively. Despite the fact that CM11 reveals no significant cytotoxicity on RAJI, Hela, SP2/0, and CHO cell lines beneath 6 mg/L at first 24 and 48 h, the viability of LNCAP cells are about 50 % at 3 mg/L, which indicates strong cytotoxicity of the peptide. In addition, macrophage toxicity by MTT assay showed that LD50 of CM11 peptide is 12 muM (16 mg/L) after 48 h while in this concentration after 24 h macrophage viability was about 70 %.
TI  - In vitro effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptide eCATH1 against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens of horses.
AB  - The equine antimicrobial peptide eCATH1 previously has been shown to have in vitro activity against antibiotic-susceptible reference strains of Rhodococcus equi and common respiratory bacterial pathogens of foals. Interestingly, eCATH1 was also found to be effective in the treatment of R. equi infection induced in mice. The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of eCATH1 against equine isolates of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp.) and Gram-positive (R. equi, Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria resistant to multiple classes of conventional antibiotics. A modified microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial peptide. The study revealed that eCATH1 was active against all equine isolates of E. coli, S. enterica, K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. and R. equi tested, with MICs of 0.5-16 mug mL(-1), but was not active against most isolates of S. aureus. In conclusion, the activity of the equine antimicrobial peptide eCATH1 appears to not be hampered by the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates. Thus, the data suggest that eCATH1 could be useful, not only in the treatment of R. equi infections, but also of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Comparative sequence, structure and redox analyses of Klebsiella pneumoniae DsbA  show that anti-virulence target DsbA enzymes fall into distinct classes.
AB  - Bacterial DsbA enzymes catalyze oxidative folding of virulence factors, and have  been identified as targets for antivirulence drugs. However, DsbA enzymes characterized to date exhibit a wide spectrum of redox properties and divergent structural features compared to the prototypical DsbA enzyme of Escherichia coli DsbA (EcDsbA). Nonetheless, sequence analysis shows that DsbAs are more highly conserved than their known substrate virulence factors, highlighting the potential to inhibit virulence across a range of organisms by targeting DsbA. For example, Salmonella enterica typhimurium (SeDsbA, 86 % sequence identity to EcDsbA) shares almost identical structural, surface and redox properties. Using comparative sequence and structure analysis we predicted that five other bacterial DsbAs would share these properties. To confirm this, we characterized Klebsiella pneumoniae DsbA (KpDsbA, 81 % identity to EcDsbA). As expected, the redox properties, structure and surface features (from crystal and NMR data) of KpDsbA were almost identical to those of EcDsbA and SeDsbA. Moreover, KpDsbA and EcDsbA bind peptides derived from their respective DsbBs with almost equal affinity, supporting the notion that compounds designed to inhibit EcDsbA will also inhibit KpDsbA. Taken together, our data show that DsbAs fall into different classes; that DsbAs within a class may be predicted by sequence analysis of binding loops; that DsbAs within a class are able to complement one another in vivo and that compounds designed to inhibit EcDsbA are likely to inhibit DsbAs within the same class.
TI  - Pharmacological and toxicological evaluation of Sulcona((R)), a traditional Siddha medicine used in the treatment of burns.
AB  - Sulcona, a Siddha proprietary medicine used for the treatment of burns, has been  in practice for more than 50 years. This medicine has been successfully used on several burned patients with an excellent recovery and safety record. In this manuscript, we investigate some of its pharmacological and safety profiles. Treatment of cells with Sulcona induced a statistically significant increase in population doubling compared to concurrent controls in proliferating human lymphocytes as well as in Balb/c 3T3 cells, suggesting that it stimulates cell proliferation. Sulcona exhibited some antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus. Carrageenan-induced rat paw edema testing suggested that Sulcona has some anti-inflammatory properties. Patch testing showed that Sulcona has mild anesthetic effects. The above properties suggest Sulcona's pharmacological properties aidin treatment of burns. Sulcona did not show any skin irritation or sensitization or mutagenic potential suggesting that it is safe for use. Further work is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms of action.
TI  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, United States.
AB  - We characterized 9 New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae  (5 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg) isolates identified in the United States and cultured from 8 patients in 5 states during April 2009-March 2011. Isolates were resistant to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, demonstrated MICs </=1 microg/mL of colistin and polymyxin, and yielded positive metallo-beta-lactamase screening results. Eight isolates had blaNDM-1, and 1 isolate had a novel allele (blaNDM-6). All 8 patients had recently been in India or Pakistan, where 6 received inpatient health care. Plasmids carrying blaNDM frequently carried AmpC or extended spectrum beta-lactamase genes. Two K. pneumoniae isolates and a K. pneumoniae isolate from Sweden shared incompatibility group A/C plasmids with indistinguishable restriction patterns and a common blaNDM fragment; all 3 were multilocus sequence type 14. Restriction profiles of the remaining New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase plasmids, including 2 from the same patient, were diverse.
TI  - Assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  - Reuse of graywater (GW) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One major impediment for reuse of GW is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three GW recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. The treated GW and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative PCR. As a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (FW) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. Comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Shigella spp., were found in the treated GW, their corresponding irrigated soils and the FW-irrigated soils. Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the GW- and FW-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. Our results suggest that GW irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.
TI  - Recombinant heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60/GroEL) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi elicits cross-protection against multiple bacterial pathogens in mice.
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) or stress proteins are recognized as protective antigens against a wide range of bacterial diseases. Conservation of HSPs across different life forms also appears to contribute to the antigenicity of these proteins. Due to their high sequence homology, there exists an immunological cross-recognition between different bacterial species. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant GroEL of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi as a vaccine candidate against various bacterial pathogens viz.; Shigella dysenteriae type I, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro serum bactericidal assay (SBA) with GroEL antisera showed 50-55% inhibition of cells of Shigella Spp., 65-75% of E. coli, 60-65% of K. pneumoniae, 45-50% of P. aeruginosa. In in vivo experiments, mice immunized with GroEL protein of S. Typhi showed 60-65% protection against S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae type I, S. boydii. Similarly 75-80% protection was observed against enteropathogenic E. coli, 70-80% against K. pneumoniae. 50% of mice survived the lethal infection against P. aeruginosa. Organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed significant reduction of bacterial infection. This study shows the cross-protective efficacy of recombinant GroEL of S. Typhi which could lead to the development of a single vaccine candidate protective against multiple bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Bovine whole-blood culture as a tool for the measurement of endotoxin activities  in Gram-negative bacterial vaccines.
AB  - In order to analyze bovine immune reactions against the Gram-negative bacterial vaccine, bovine whole-blood culture was used to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We also examined the interaction between LPS and aluminum hydroxide gel for endotoxin activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses of whole bovine blood. Alteration in the mRNA concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-10 in whole-blood culture at 4h after stimulation with different doses of LPS was observed and determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The mRNA concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta changed in a dose-dependent manner and differed depending on the type of LPS. Limulus test revealed that endotoxin activity was remarkably reduced when aluminum hydroxide gel was added to LPS. In contrast, the mRNA concentration of TNF-alpha in whole bovine blood was enhanced by LPS mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel. These results suggest that bovine whole-blood culture can be utilized to detect endotoxin activity of Gram-negative bacterial vaccines. In addition, whole-blood culture offers several advantages, such as ease of performance, few preparation artifacts, and a physiological cell environment, for investigating bovine immune response compared with the Limulus test.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of Klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. The nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. Spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by TEM analysis. XRD pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. FTIR spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. The silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Insights into the evolution of gene organization and multidrug resistance from Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pKF3-140.
AB  - Plasmid-mediated transfer of drug-resistance genes among various bacterial species is considered one of the most important mechanisms for the spread of multidrug resistance. To gain insights into the evolution of gene organization and antimicrobial resistance in clinical bacterial samples, a complete plasmid genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae pKF3-140 is determined, which has a circular chromosome of 147,416bp in length. Among the 203 predicted genes, 142 have function assignment and about 50 appear to be involved in plasmid replication, maintenance, conjugative transfer, iron acquisition and transport, and drug resistance. Extensive comparative genomic analyses revealed that pKF3-140 exhibits a rather low sequence similarity and structural conservation with other reported K. pneumoniae plasmids. In contrast, the overall organization of pKF3-140 is highly similar to Escherichia coli plasmids p1ESCUM and pUTI89, which indicates the possibility that K. pneumoniae pKF3-140 may have a potential origin in E. coli. Meanwhile, interestingly, several drug resistant genes show high similarity to the plasmid pU302L in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium U302 strain G8430 and the plasmid pK245 in K. pneumoniae. This mosaic pattern of sequence similarities suggests that pKF3-140 might have arisen from E. coli and acquired the resistance genes from a variety of enteric bacteria and underscores the importance of a further understanding of horizontal gene transfer among enteric bacteria.
TI  - [Genetic determinants of secreted lysozyme inhibitors and enterobacteria anti-lysozyme phenotype].
AB  - AIM: Determination of interconnection of genetic determinants of secreted lysozyme inhibitors with enterobacteria anti-lysozyme phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 cultures of non-hemolytic Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from feces of patients with stage I - II intestine dysbiosis and Salmonella enterica isolated from patients with acute intestinal infections (AII) and reconvalescent salmonella carriers served as material for the study. Isolation of matrix DNA of the studied strains for PCR was carried out by DNA-Express kit (Lytex Co., Russia). PCR screening of secreted lysozyme inhibitors genes ivyC and pli was performed based on Syntol Co. (Russia) primers and reagents. Amplicon detection was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis method. Detection of general anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) was performed by plate method, secreted and sorption ALA components - photometrically by O.V. Bukharin et al. (1999) and V.Yu.Sokolov and A.P.Luda (1987) methods, respectively. RESULTS: Screening of chromosome localization genes - ivyC in escherichiae and klebsiellae and pliC in salmonellae by PCR method showed their ubiquitous spread among the studied cultures. The search for homologues of pliC gene that are characteristic for K. pneumoniae virulence plasmid revealed positive result in 19 +/- 5.5% of cases. The lowest level of ALA wa noted in carriers of only ivyC gene accounting for an average of 2.8 +/- 0.6 microg/mlxOD, while all enterobacteria with pliC gene had average ALA value of 4 +/- 0.3 microg/mlxOD. CONCLUSION: Anti-lysozyme activity of enterobacteria is part of the general mechanism of microorganism lysozyme resistance and is determined by the presence of secreted lysozyme inhibitor genes. Application of molecular-genetic approach in the form of the developed experimental test-system based on PCR method allowed to detect secreted lysozyme inhibitor genes in screening mode. High level of secretory ALA is coupled with the presence of pliC gene, while in ivyC gene carriers lower values of the attribute were detected.
TI  - Chemical rescue of the post-translationally carboxylated lysine mutant of allantoinase and dihydroorotase by metal ions and short-chain carboxylic acids.
AB  - Bacterial allantoinase (ALLase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) are members of the cyclic amidohydrolase family. ALLase and DHOase possess similar binuclear metal centers in the active site in which two metals are bridged by a post-translationally carboxylated lysine. In this study, we determined the effects of carboxylated lysine and metal binding on the activities of ALLase and DHOase. Although DHOase is a metalloenzyme, purified DHOase showed high activity without additional metal supplementation in a reaction mixture or bacterial culture. However, unlike DHOase, ALLase had no activity unless some specific metal ions were added to the reaction mixture or culture. Substituting the metal binding sites H59, H61, K146, H186, H242, or D315 with alanine completely abolished the activity of ALLase. However, the K146C, K146D and K146E mutants of ALLase were still active with about 1-6% activity of the wild-type enzyme. These ALLase K146 mutants were found to have 1.4-1.7 mol metal per mole enzyme subunit, which may indicate that they still contained the binuclear metal center in the active site. The activity of the K146A mutant of the ALLase and the K103A mutant of DHOase can be chemically rescued by short-chain carboxylic acids, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, but not by ethanol, propan-1-ol, and imidazole, in the presence of Co2+ or Mn2+ ions. However, the activity was still ~10-fold less than that of wild-type ALLase. Overall, these results indicated that the 20 natural basic amino acid residues were not sufficiently able to play the role of lysine. Accordingly, we proposed that during evolution, the post-translational modification of carboxylated lysine in the cyclic amidohydrolase family was selected for promoting binuclear metal center self-assembly and increasing the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide at the active site for enzyme catalysis. This kind of chemical rescue combined with site-directed mutagenesis may also be used to identify a binuclear metal center in the active site for other metalloenzymes.
TI  - Furanone-containing poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers for cell-adhesion inhibition.
AB  - The 3(2H) furanone derivative 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) was investigated for its antimicrobial and cell-adhesion inhibition properties against Klebsiella pneumoniae Xen 39, Staphylococcus aureus Xen 36, Escherichia coli Xen 14, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xen 5 and Salmonella typhimurium Xen 26. Nanofibers electrospun from solution blends of DMHF and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were tested for their ability to inhibit surface-attachment of bacteria. Antimicrobial and adhesion inhibition activity was determined via the plate counting technique. To quantify viable but non-culturable cells and to validate the plate counting results, bioluminescence and fluorescence studies were carried out. Nanofiber production was upscaled using the bubble electrospinning technique. To ascertain that no DMHF leached into filtered water, samples of water filtered through the nanofibrous mats were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to characterize the electrospun nanofibers.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  - The diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. The DGGE profiles targeted the bacterial 16S rDNA and revealed the presence of Citrobacter farmeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pantoea agglomerans, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus sciuri and Weissella confusa. The bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. The bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; Brachybacterium rhamnosum, E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, Kurthia gibsonii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus kloosii and S. sciuri were identified. Koji collected during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and Enterobacter pulveris were identified. In brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 Bacillus species, but 4 Staphylococcus species and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. This study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.
TI  - The target of daptomycin is absent from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  - Antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. When these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against Gram negatives. Here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent from E. coli and other Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Tigecycline challenge triggers sRNA production in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria employ complex transcriptional networks involving multiple genes in response to stress, which is not limited to gene and protein networks but now includes small RNAs (sRNAs). These regulatory RNA molecules are increasingly shown to be able to initiate regulatory cascades and modulate the expression of multiple genes that are involved in or required for survival under environmental challenge. Despite mounting evidence for the importance of sRNAs in stress response, their role upon antibiotic exposure remains unknown. In this study, we sought to determine firstly, whether differential expression of sRNAs occurs upon antibiotic exposure and secondly, whether these sRNAs could be attributed to microbial tolerance to antibiotics. RESULTS: A small scale sRNA cloning strategy of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 challenged with half the minimal inhibitory concentration of tigecycline identified four sRNAs (sYJ5, sYJ20, sYJ75 and sYJ118) which were reproducibly upregulated in the presence of either tigecycline or tetracycline. The coding sequences of the four sRNAs were found to be conserved across a number of species. Genome analysis found that sYJ5 and sYJ118 mapped between the 16S and 23S rRNA encoding genes. sYJ20 (also known as SroA) is encoded upstream of the tbpAyabKyabJ operon and is classed as a riboswitch, whilst its role in antibiotic stress-response appears independent of its riboswitch function. sYJ75 is encoded between genes that are involved in enterobactin transport and metabolism. Additionally we find that the genetic deletion of sYJ20 rendered a reduced viability phenotype in the presence of tigecycline, which was recovered when complemented. The upregulation of some of these sRNAs were also observed when S. Typhimurium was challenged by ampicillin (sYJ5, 75 and 118); or when Klebsiella pneumoniae was challenged by tigecycline (sYJ20 and 118). CONCLUSIONS: Small RNAs are overexpressed as a result of antibiotic exposure in S. Typhimurium where the same molecules are upregulated in a related species or after exposure to different antibiotics. sYJ20, a riboswitch, appears to possess a trans-regulatory sRNA role in antibiotic tolerance. These findings imply that the sRNA mediated response is a component of the bacterial response to antibiotic challenge.
TI  - Characterization of five novel endolysins from Gram-negative infecting bacteriophages.
AB  - We here characterize five globular endolysins, encoded by a set of Gram-negative  infecting bacteriophages: BcepC6gp22 (Burkholderia cepacia phage BcepC6B), P2gp09 (Escherichia coli phage P2), PsP3gp10 (Salmonella enterica phage PsP3), K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15 (Klebsiella pneumoniae phages K11 and KP32, respectively). In silico, BcepC6gp22, P2gp10 and PsP3gp10 are predicted to possess lytic transglycosylase activity, whereas K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15 have putative amidase activity. All five endolysins show muralytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several Gram-negative bacterial species. In vitro, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is clearly sensitive for the antibacterial action of the five endolysins in the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizer EDTA: reductions are ranging from 1.89 to 3.08 log units dependent on the endolysin. The predicted transglycosylases BcepC6gp22, P2gp10 and PsP3gp10 have a substantially higher muralytic and in vitro antibacterial activity compared to the predicted amidases K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15, highlighting the impact of the catalytic specificity on endolysin activity. Furthermore, initial data exclude the synergistic lethal effect of a combination of the predicted transglycosylase PsP3gp10 and the predicted amidase K11gp3.5 on PAO1. As these globular endolysins show a lower enzymatic and antibacterial activity, in comparison to modular endolysins, we suggest that the latter should be favored for antibacterial applications.
TI  - Receptor-independent interaction of bacterial lipopolysaccharide with lipid and lymphocyte membranes; the role of cholesterol.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major constituent of bacterial outer membranes where it makes up the bulk of the outer leaflet and plays a key role as determinant of bacterial interactions with the host. Membrane-free LPS is known to activate T-lymphocytes through interactions with Toll-like receptor 4 via multiprotein complexes. In the present study, we investigate the role of cholesterol and membrane heterogeneities as facilitators of receptor-independent LPS binding and insertion, which underpin bacterial interactions with the host in symbiosis, pathogenesis and cell invasion. We use fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of membrane-free LPS from intestinal gram-negative organisms with cholesterol-containing model membranes and with T-lymphocytes. LPS preparations from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica were found to bind preferentially to mixed lipid membranes by comparison to pure PC bilayers. The same was observed for LPS from the symbiote Escherichia coli but with an order of magnitude higher dissociation constant. Insertion of LPS into model membranes confirmed the preference for sphingomyelin/cholesterol-containing systems. LPS insertion into Jurkat T-lymphocyte membranes reveals that they have a significantly greater LPS-binding capacity by comparison to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin cholesterol-depleted lymphocyte membranes, albeit at slightly lower binding rates.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in Kolkata, India, and in vitro experiments on effect of combined chemotherapy.
AB  - This communication states the changing patterns of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) isolates causing enteric fever in and around Kolkata, India. Among the isolates resistance to ampicillin (A), chloramphenicol (C), cotrimoxazole (Co) and tetracycline (T) were plasmid mediated; the plasmid was unstable in S. Typhi, and the other enteric bacteria like Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were found to be the potential source of dissemination of such plasmids into S. Typhi. The infection with such S. Typhi strains were successfully treated with ciprofloxacin (Cp: MICs 0.0075-0.075 mug mL(-)(1)) and/or ofloxacin (Ofx: MICs 0.0125-0.075 mug mL(-)(1)), but in the later course, the S. Typhi strains, showing resistance to nalidixic acid, developed low level of resistance to Cp and Ofx, causing the treatment failure. Thus, the treatment regimen was shifted to the third generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone (Ct) and cefotaxime (Cf). Keeping in mind the anticipation of development of resistance to Ct/Cf, we prepared the treatment regimen for MDR enteric fever, based on the double-drug synergy tests in vitro; Cp-gentamycin (FICI 0.121-0.216) and Cp-trimethoprim (FICI 0.14-0.483) combinations were found effective against S. Typhi isolates having decreased sensitivity to cp (MICs: 0.5-1.25 mug mL(-)(1)).
TI  - C1 inhibitor suppresses the endotoxic activity of a wide range of lipopolysaccharides and interacts with live gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Human C1 inhibitor (C1INH) prevents endotoxin shock via a direct interaction with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and improves survival in animal models of sepsis. In this report, we further characterize the interaction of C1INH with LPS and whole live bacteria. We investigate C1INH interactions with LPS from five different strains of Gram-negative enteric bacteria known to participate in the pathogenesis of human sepsis. Treatment with C1INH improved survival in mice with endotoxin shock induced by LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as previously shown, as well as LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a trend to improved survival was observed when Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens LPS were used. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shift experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of C1INH with LPS from all the strains studied. The binding of both native and reactive center-cleaved, inactive C1INH results in inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of C1INH to bind at the surface of only a restricted number of whole live Gram-negative bacteria as well as mutant bacteria expressing a truncated LPS lacking the O-antigen. These data reveal the interaction of C1INH with a wide range of enteric bacterial LPS and strongly suggest that the interaction between C1INH and the surface of Gram-negative microorganisms is determined by the length of the polysaccharide chain of the endotoxin molecule.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC. METHODS: Sponge samples was collected from sub-tidal habitats at Kavaratti Island and identified. The endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated and selected potential bacteria which show antibacterial activity in preliminary screening against clinical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Klebsiella pneumoniea (K. pneumoniea) and Streptococcus sp. by disc diffusion assay. The crude extracts of potential bacteria LB3 was tested against clinical pathogens by MIC. The LB3 strain was identified by 16s rDNA sequencing, 1 111 bp was submitted in NCBI (HQ589912) and constructed phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Sponge sample was identified as Dysidea granulosa (D. granulosa) and potential bacteria LB3 identified as Enterobacter sp TTAG. Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Changes in transcriptional orientation are associated with increases in evolutionary rates of enterobacterial genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in transcriptional orientation ("CTOs") occur frequently in prokaryotic genomes. Such changes usually result from genomic inversions, which may cause a conflict between the directions of replication and transcription and an increase in mutation rate. However, CTOs do not always lead to the replication-transcription confrontation. Furthermore, CTOs may cause deleterious disruptions of operon structure and/or gene regulations. The currently existing CTOs may indicate relaxation of selection pressure. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether CTOs have an independent effect on the evolutionary rates of the affected genes, and whether these genes are subject to any type of selection pressure in prokaryotes. METHODS: Three closely related enterbacteria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, were selected for comparisons of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rate between the genes that have experienced changes in transcriptional orientation (changed-orientation genes, "COGs") and those that do not (same-orientation genes, "SOGs"). The dN/dS ratio was also derived to evaluate the selection pressure on the analyzed genes. Confounding factors in the estimation of evolutionary rates, such as gene essentiality, gene expression level, replication-transcription confrontation, and decreased dS at gene terminals were controlled in the COG-SOG comparisons. RESULTS: We demonstrate that COGs have significantly higher dN and dS than SOGs when a series of confounding factors are controlled. However, the dN/dS ratios are similar between the two gene groups, suggesting that the increase in dS can sufficiently explain the increase in dN in COGs. Therefore, the increases in evolutionary rates in COGs may be mainly mutation-driven. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that CTOs can increase the evolutionary rates of the affected genes. This effect is independent of the replication-transcription confrontation, which is suggested to be the major cause of inversion-associated evolutionary rate increases. The real cause of such evolutionary rate increases remains unclear but is worth further explorations.
TI  - Engineering genetically encoded nanosensors for real-time in vivo measurements of citrate concentrations.
AB  - Citrate is an intermediate in catabolic as well as biosynthetic pathways and is an important regulatory molecule in the control of glycolysis and lipid metabolism. Mass spectrometric and NMR based metabolomics allow measuring citrate concentrations, but only with limited spatial and temporal resolution. Methods are so far lacking to monitor citrate levels in real-time in-vivo. Here, we present a series of genetically encoded citrate sensors based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We screened databases for citrate-binding proteins and tested three candidates in vitro. The citrate binding domain of the Klebsiella pneumoniae histidine sensor kinase CitA, inserted between the FRET pair Venus/CFP, yielded a sensor highly specific for citrate. We optimized the peptide linkers to achieve maximal FRET change upon citrate binding. By modifying residues in the citrate binding pocket, we were able to construct seven sensors with different affinities spanning a concentration range of three orders of magnitude without losing specificity. In a first in vivo application we show that E. coli maintains the capacity to take up glucose or acetate within seconds even after long-term starvation.
TI  - The role of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Active efflux proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are thought to have a protective role in the intestinal tract by preventing xenotoxin absorption. Some bacteria also need to adhere to the intestinal tract before causing disease through adhesin secretion. Thus, this study was initiated to examine whether any association exists between bacterial adhesion. METHODS: Three human cell lines (Caco2, RKO, and MCF7), and 6 species of bacteria were used in this study (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium sporogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Following incubation of our cells with active efflux inhibitors, bacteria incubated with a stable fluorescent dye were co-incubated at 37 degrees C for various times up to 240min. Fluorescence intensity was used to compare bacterial attachment to these cell lines with either normal efflux protein expression or with induction or inhibition of efflux proteins. RESULTS: P-gp inhibition by either PSC-833 or GF120918 resulted in a significant increase of all bacterial attachment to Caco2 cells up to 3 fold. RKO cells and MCF7 cells did not alter their bacterial attachment with PSC-833. Fumitremorgen C, a dedicated BCRP inhibitor had no effect. In addition, rifampicin, a P-gp inducer, resulted in some limited reduction in Salmonella and Klebsiella attachment only. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate P-gp expression may contribute to the resistance of potential bacterial toxicity, by preventing them adhering to human enterocytes cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which may reduce the risk or intensity of gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Composition and antibacterial activity of essential oil from Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth.
AB  - The chemical composition of the steam volatile oil of the whole aerial part of Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), obtained by steam distillation, has been analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS. The oil was found to be rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (88.6%). A total of 50 constituents were identified, representing 94.4% of the total oil composition. Linalool (37.0%) and 1-octen-3-ol (32.0%) were found to be the principal constituents. The antibacterial activity of the oil was determined against 10 bacterial strains by measuring the growth inhibitory zones. The oil showed significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and the Gram-negative, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica enterica. A minimum inhibitory concentration of 31.25 microL mL(-1) was observed against E. faecalis.
TI  - Antisense inhibition of gene expression and growth in gram-negative bacteria by cell-penetrating peptide conjugates of peptide nucleic acids targeted to rpoD gene.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) cause common and severe hospital- and community-acquired infections with a high incidence of multidrug resistance (MDR) and mortality. The emergence and spread of MDR-GNB strains limit therapeutic options and highlight the need to develop new therapeutic strategies. In this study, the peptide (RXR)(4)XB- and (KFF)(3)K-conjugated peptide nucleic acids (PPNAs) were developed to target rpoD, which encodes an RNA polymerase primary sigma(70) that is thought to be essential for bacterial growth. Their antimicrobial activities were tested against different clinical isolates of MDR-GNB in vitro and in infection models. The (RXR)(4)XB- and (KFF)(3)K- conjugated PNAs were bactericidal against different strains of MDR-GNB in concentration-dependent and sequence-selective manner, whereas a PPNA with a scrambled base sequence had no effect on growth. Among tested PPNAs, (RXR)(4)XB conjugate PPNA06 showed more potent and broad spectrum inhibition in multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella flexneri in vitro and in vivo. The results were associated with suppression of rpoD mRNA and sigma(70) expression, as well as sigma(70) downstream regulated genes including ftsZ, mazF, prfB, rpoS, seqA, turfB and ygjD. The treatment of PPNA06 on mono- or multiple MDR-GBN infected human gastric mucosal epithelial cells demonstrated the complete inhibition on bacterial growth and no influence on morphology and growth of human cells. Also, PPNA06 did not show the induction of antibiotic resistance as compared with classical antibiotics in GNB. These findings firstly demonstrate that rpoD is potential target for developing antisense antibiotics, and indicate that peptide conjugates of anti-rpoD PNA are active against GNBs in vitro and in vivo. Our results offer a feasible strategy for treating MDR-GNB infections.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
AB  - The continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. B. oleracea L (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. However, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. The methanol crude extract of B. oleracea L. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. The screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. It was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), respectively. Remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, Trichophyton rubrum and Aspergillus terreus. Red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. This extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
TI  - Essential oils from Moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. Antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important Gram-negative pathogens. Use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). The objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. This activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in Salmonella LPS deep-rough mutants. In addition, essential oils of Thymus maroccanus and Thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. These results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.
TI  - Impedimetric biosensor based on self-assembled hybrid cystein-gold nanoparticles  and CramoLL lectin for bacterial lipopolysaccharide recognition.
AB  - We report the development of a new selective and specific electrochemical biosensor for bacterial lipolysaccharide (LPS). An electrode interface was constructed using a l-cysteine-gold nanoparticle (AuNpCys) composite to be immobilized by electrostatic interaction in the network of a poly(vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate maleic acid) (PVM) layer on a gold bare electrode. The impedimetric biosensor is fabricated by self-assembled CramoLL lectin on the PVM-AuNpCys-modified gold electrode through electrostatic interaction. CramoLL is used as the recognition interface. AFM images showed that LPS was specifically recognized on the PVM-AuNpCys-CramoLL system surface. The measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the electrochemical response of a redox probe system (K(4)[Fe(CN)(6)](4-)/K(3)[Fe(CN)(6)](3-)) were blocked, due to the procedures of modified electrode with PVM-AuNpCys-CramoLL. In the majority of the experiments the lectin retained its activity as observed through its interaction with LPS from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results are expressed in terms of the charge transfer resistance and current peak anodic using the EIS and CV techniques for the development of a biosensor for contamination by endotoxins. A new type of sensor for selective discrimination of LPS types with a high sensitivity has been obtained.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Corn flake-like morphology of iron nanoparticles and its antibacterial property.
AB  
TI  - High burden of antimicrobial resistance in Asia.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in Asian countries. In Asia, one of the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, MDR Salmonella enterica serotypes Choleraesuis and Typhi, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (OXA-58 and OXA-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant Candida glabrata. A few clones of MDR A. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in Asia, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed in China. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. Continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Ultrasonographic diagnosis of an endocarditis valvularis in a Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) with pneumonia.
AB  - An 11-yr-old Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) was presented with a history of respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography and an endoscopic examination of the left lung were performed and revealed severe pneumonia. Microbiologic examination of a tracheal wash sample and an endoscopy-guided sample from the lung confirmed infection with Salmonella enterica ssp. IV, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Computed tomographic examination demonstrated a hyperattenuated structure within the heart. Echocardiographic examination revealed a hyperechoic mass at the pulmonic valve as well as a dilated truncus pulmonalis. As therapy for pneumonia was ineffective, the snake was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed pneumonia and infective endocarditis of the pulmonic valve caused by septicemia with Salmonella enterica ssp. IV. Focal arteriosclerosis of the pulmonary trunk was also diagnosed. The case presented here demonstrates the possible connection between respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in snakes.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a group of low molecular-weight plasmids carrying multiple IS903 elements flanking a kanamycin resistance aph gene in Salmonella enterica serovars.
AB  - A group of low molecular-weight ColE1-like plasmids carrying the aph sequence type aph(ii) from three different Salmonella serovars were sequenced. These plasmids carry two or more copies of IS903 elements, with up to 21bp sequence differences to one another, two of which flank the aph gene. This group of plasmids did not appear to carry any known mobilization genes and instead carry three open reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function possibly organized in an operon. The plasmid replication region (RNA I/II--rom) of this plasmid group showed extensive homology to that of pKPN2 plasmid of Klebsiella pneumoniae and pCol-let plasmid of Escherichia coli. Three of the four plasmids had identical sequences, and the fourth had an extra copy of IS903 with target duplication, suggesting a recent divergence in the different Salmonella serovars from a common ancestor.
TI  - Altering the composition of caseicins A and B as a means of determining the contribution of specific residues to antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) are antimicrobial peptides generated through the bacterial fermentation of sodium caseinate, and on the basis of this and previous studies, they are active against many Gram-negative pathogens (Cronobacter sakazakii, Cronobacter muytjensii, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) as well as the Gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus. Here we describe further studies with the aim of establishing the importance of specific (charged and nonpolar aliphatic) residues within the caseicin peptides and the effects that they have on the bacteria listed above. In order to achieve our objective, we created four derivatives of each caseicin (A1 to A4 and B1 to B4) in which specific residues were altered, and results obtained with these derivatives were compared to wild-type caseicin activity. Although conversion of cationic residues to alanine in caseicins B1 (R8A change), A1 (K2A), A2 (H3A), and A3 (K2A-H3A) generally resulted in their activity against microbial targets being reduced or unaltered, C. sakazakii DPC6440 was unusual in that it displayed enhanced sensitivity to three peptides (caseicins A1, A3, and B2) in which positively charged residues had been eliminated. While the replacement of leucine with alanine in selected variants (B3 and B4) resulted in reduced activity against a number of strains of Cronobacter and, in some cases, S. Typhimurium, these changes enhanced the activities of these peptides against DPC6440 and a number of S. aureus strains. It is thus apparent that the importance of specific residues within the caseicin peptides is dependent on the strain being targeted.
TI  - Sensitization of microcin J25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  - Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by Escherichia coli. MccJ25 inhibits RNA polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. MccJ25 uptake into E. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor FhuA and the inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbB, ExbD, and SbmA. This peptide is active on some E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella species strains, while other Gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, are completely resistant. In the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (KFF)(3)K made some resistant strains sensitive to MccJ25, among them S. Typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. The results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (KFF)(3)K allows MccJ25 penetration in an FhuA and SbmA-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic Salmonella strains.
TI  - A report from the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious  Diseases (April 10-13, 2010 - Vienna, Austria).
AB  - Effective antimicrobials currently in use in Europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. Multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). As extensively discussed in an oral session entitled Worldwide Dissemination of Resistances by 10 specialists from across Europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (Roede, B.M. et al., Abst O127; Huenger, F. et al., Abst O395; Mera, R.M. et al., Abst O483). While many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (Derde, L. et al., Abst O464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the Austria Center in Vienna. The war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. Treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. However, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in Vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.
TI  - L-Glutamine as a nitrogen source for Corynebacterium glutamicum: derepression of  the AmtR regulon and implications for nitrogen sensing.
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum, a Gram-positive soil bacterium employed in the industrial production of various amino acids, is able to use a number of different nitrogen sources, such as ammonium, urea or creatinine. This study shows that l-glutamine serves as an excellent nitrogen source for C. glutamicum and allows similar growth rates in glucose minimal medium to those in ammonium. A transcriptome comparison revealed that the nitrogen starvation response was elicited when glutamine served as the sole nitrogen source, meaning that the target genes of the global nitrogen regulator AmtR were derepressed. Subsequent growth experiments with a variety of mutants defective in nitrogen metabolism showed that glutamate synthase is crucial for glutamine utilization, while a putative glutaminase is dispensable under the experimental conditions used. The gltBD operon encoding the glutamate synthase is a member of the AmtR regulon. The observation that the nitrogen starvation response was elicited at high intracellular l-glutamine levels has implications for nitrogen sensing. In contrast with other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, a drop in glutamine concentration obviously does not serve as a nitrogen starvation signal in C. glutamicum.
TI  - The omptins of Yersinia pestis and Salmonella enterica cleave the reactive center loop of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1.
AB  - Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and a key molecule that regulates fibrinolysis by inactivating human plasminogen activators. Here we show that two important human pathogens, the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis and the enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, inactivate PAI-1 by cleaving the R346-M347 bait peptide bond in the reactive center loop. No cleavage of PAI-1 was detected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an oral/fecal pathogen from which Y. pestis has evolved, or with Escherichia coli. The cleavage and inactivation of PAI-1 were mediated by the outer membrane proteases plasminogen activator Pla of Y. pestis and PgtE protease of S. enterica, which belong to the omptin family of transmembrane endopeptidases identified in Gram-negative bacteria. Cleavage of PAI-1 was also detected with the omptins Epo of Erwinia pyrifoliae and Kop of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which both belong to the same omptin subfamily as Pla and PgtE, whereas no cleavage of PAI-1 was detected with omptins of Shigella flexneri or E. coli or the Yersinia chromosomal omptins, which belong to other omptin subfamilies. The results reveal a novel serpinolytic mechanism by which enterobacterial species expressing omptins of the Pla subfamily bypass normal control of host proteolysis.
TI  - Engineering of glycerol dehydrogenase for improved activity towards 1, 3-butanediol.
AB  - The objective of this study was to use protein engineering techniques to enhance  the catalytic activity of glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH) on racemic 1, 3-butanediol (1, 3-BDO) for the bioproduction of the important pharmaceutical intermediate 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. Three GlyDH genes (gldA) from Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578 were shuffled to generate a random mutagenesis library. The nitroblue tetrazolium/phenazine methosulfate high throughput screening protocol was used to select four chimeric enzymes with up to a 2.6-fold improved activity towards 1, 3-BDO. A rational design method was also employed to further improve the enzyme activity after DNA shuffling. Based on the homology model of GlyDH (Escherichia coli), Asp121 was predicted to influence 1, 3-BDO binding and replaced with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Combination of the mutations from both DNA shuffling and rational design produced the best mutant with a V (max) value of 126.6 U/mg, a 26-fold activity increase compared with that of the wild type GlyDH from E. coli.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded blaCMY-2 located on a novel SXT/R391-related integrating conjugative element in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  - Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. Although SXT/R391-related ICEs, originally demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates, have become prevalent among V. cholerae isolates in Asia, the prevalence of the ICEs among gram-negative bacteria other than Vibrio spp. remains unknown. In addition, SXT/R391-related ICEs carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. Here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, TUM4660, which revealed the presence of a novel SXT/R391-related ICE, ICEPmiJpn1. ICEPmiJpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of R391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of R391, while an IS10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(CMY-2) was integrated into the ICE. A nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of ISEcp1 was located upstream of the bla(CMY-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(CMY-2) in earlier studies were also present. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in ICEPmiJpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in SXT(MO10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in P. mirabilis ATCC 29906, respectively. ICEPmiJpn1 was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. These observations suggest that ICEs may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ICEs, including SXT/R391-related ICEs.
TI  - Substitution of the arginine/leucine residues in apidaecin Ib with peptoid residues: effect on antimicrobial activity, cellular uptake, and proteolytic degradation.
AB  - Several aspects of the mechanism of action of Pro-rich antimicrobial peptides, together with their low toxicity in mammalian cells, make them good candidates for the development of new antibiotic agents. We investigated the effect induced in the insect antimicrobial peptide apidaecin Ib by the replacement of a single arginine/leucine residue with a N-substituted glycine. The resulting peptoid-peptide hybrids are more resistant to proteolysis and devoid of any significant cytotoxic activity, but moving the [NArg]residue from the N- to the C-terminal end of the molecule progressively reduces the antibacterial activity. Cell uptake experiments in E. coli cells suggest that the loss of antibacterial activity of [NArg(17)]apidaecin is a consequence of its inability to translocate into bacterial cells. Conversely, apidaecin and its peptoid-peptide hybrids are able to cross the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells and to diffuse in the cytosol, although their translocating ability is far less effective than that of other known cell permeant peptides.
TI  - The cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. METHODS: Prototypic cyclotides, including the Mobius kalata B1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin O2 (cyO2), were isolated using reversed-phase HPLC. Initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (RDAs) and MIC assays with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as test strains. For the most active peptide, cyO2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. Charged residues in cyO2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. RESULTS: CyO2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli in RDAs and MIC assays, while the other peptides were less active. In time-kill assays, cyO2 also had bactericidal activity against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against S. aureus. Chemical masking of the charged Glu and Lys residues in cyO2 caused a near total loss of activity against Salmonella, while masking Arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. CONCLUSIONS: CyO2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The charged residues in cyO2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. In combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyO2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles prepared via non-hydrolytic solution  route.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles has been investigated and presented in this paper. Nanoparticles were prepared via non-hydrolytic solution process using zinc acetate di-hydrate (Zn(CH(3)COO)(2).2H(2)O) and aniline (C(6)H(5)NH(2)) in 6 h refluxing at approximately 65 degrees C. In the presence of four pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antibacterial study of zinc oxide nanoparticles were observed. The antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were studied by spectroscopic method taking different concentrations (5-45 microg/ml) of ZnO-NPs. Our investigation reveals that the lowest concentration of ZnO-NPs solution inhibiting the growth of microbial strain is found to be 5 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae, whereas for E. coli, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium, it was calculated to be 15 microg/ml. The diameter of each ZnO-NPs lies between "20 and 30 nm" as observed from FESEM and transmission electron microscopy images. The composition of synthesized material was analyzed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and it shows the band of ZnO at 441 cm(-1). Additionally, on the basis of morphological and chemical observations, the chemical reaction mechanism of ZnO-NPs was also proposed.
TI  - Asymmetrical distribution of the second messenger c-di-GMP upon bacterial cell division.
AB  - The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) regulates cellular motility and the synthesis of organelles and molecules that promote adhesion to a variety of biological and nonbiological surfaces. These properties likely require tight spatial and temporal regulation of c-di-GMP concentration. We have developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors to monitor c-di-GMP concentrations within single bacterial cells by microscopy. Fluctuations of c-di-GMP were visualized in diverse Gram-negative bacterial species and observed to be cell cycle dependent. Asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP in the progeny correlated with the time of cell division and polarization for Caulobacter crescentus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP was observed as part of cell division, which may indicate an important regulatory step in extracellular organelle biosynthesis or function.
TI  - Production and immunogenicity of recombinant ferric enterobactin protein (FepA).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ferric siderophore complexes are produced by most bacteria to acquire iron, a vital element. These complexes are transported across the outer membrane by receptor proteins commonly known as FepA (ferric enterobactin protein). In this study we attempted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the membrane protein FepA, aiming at inhibition of iron uptake to protect invasion of the host by the bacterium. METHODS: The genomic fepA gene was amplified from Escherichia coli O157:H7. The PCR product was ligated into pET28a and was then expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant protein purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography was injected into BALB/C mice to induce immunity. Antibody titer was determined by ELISA. Mouse groups were challenged with various doses of E. coli O157:H7, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi to study immune response. RESULTS: An 85-kDa recombinant protein was expressed and purified. Immunogenicity of the recombinant protein was determined by injecting BALB/C mice. The antibody produced therein could efficiently recognize and bind ferric enterobactin binding protein. Immunized mice challenged with higher doses of selected bacteria survived. CONCLUSIONS: Significant recognition by the antibody of ferric enterobactin binding protein may lead to its application in the restriction of Enterobacteriaceae propagation.
TI  - ramR mutations in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to tigecycline.
AB  - Five Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to tigecycline (MIC, 2 microg/ml) were analyzed. A gene homologous to ramR of Salmonella enterica was identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sequencing of ramR in the nonsusceptible Klebsiella strains revealed deletions, insertions, and point mutations. Transformation of mutants with wild-type ramR genes, but not with mutant ramR genes, restored susceptibility to tigecycline and repressed overexpression of ramA and acrB. Thus, this study reveals a molecular mechanism for tigecycline resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - The designer proline-rich antibacterial peptide A3-APO is effective against systemic Escherichia coli infections in different mouse models.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are considered to be viable alternatives to conventional antibiotics. However, they rarely show systemic efficacy in animal models when added at non-toxic doses. The dimer A3-APO was designed to attack both the bacterial membrane and the Enterobacteriaceae-specific domain of the heat shock protein DnaK in order to reduce toxicity whilst maintaining activity. The peptide exhibited a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 2-128 mg/L against 28 clinical Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, with a median MIC of 30 mg/L. At this concentration, A3-APO was bactericidal to E. coli 5770, a fluoroquinolone-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strain. The No Observed Adverse Effect Limit (NOAEL) at repeated intraperitoneal peptide administration was 20mg/kg. When administered at this dose three times starting immediately after E. coli Neumann infection, A3-APO cured 100% of mice in a standard bacteraemia model used by the pharmaceutical industry. In a more stringent assay, when treatment started after E. coli 5770 bacteraemia had already been established, three doses of 10mg/kg A3-APO prolonged early survival at a rate similar to that of imipenem and reduced the bacterial counts to base level. When the second assay was repeated in kidney clearance conditions resembling those in humans, 10mg/kg A3-APO was as efficacious as imipenem in the long-term. The increased in vivo efficacy compared with the in vitro bactericidal figures can potentially be explained by the generally observable immunostimulatory properties of antimicrobial peptides. Peptide A3-APO shows promising features as a member in our antibiotic arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor BLI-489.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/BLI-489 combination. METHODS: BLI-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/L. Spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/BLI-489-containing agar plates. Five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/BLI-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. Mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (OXA-3, OXA-7, ACT-1, SHV-1 or none), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5) and Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). Two AmpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative P. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was < or =32 mg/L. During serial passages, the MIC increased 64- and 128-fold for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5) and E. cloacae (AmpC), respectively, to > or =512 mg/L. The MIC reverted to < or =64 mg/L after serial passages in drug-free medium. The MICs increased only 4-fold for K. pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5), E. coli (OXA-3) and E. coli (SHV-1). CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin/BLI-489 demonstrated a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The MPC value for all strains was < or =32 mg/L. Resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as MIC values reverted to < or =64 mg/L after propagation in drug-free medium.
TI  - The pheV phenylalanine tRNA gene Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates is an integration hotspot for possible niche-adaptation genomic islands.
AB  - Horizontally acquired genomic islands may allow bacteria to conquer and colonize  previously uncharted niches. Four Klebsiella pneumoniae tRNA gene insertion hotspots (arg6, asn34, met56, and pheV) in 101 clinical isolates derived from blood, sputum, wound, bile or urine specimens were screened by long-range PCR for the presence or absence of integrated islands. The pheV phenylalanine tRNA gene was the most frequently occupied site and harbored at least three entirely distinct types of islands: (1) KpGI-1, a 3.7 kb island coding for four proteins, three of which showed high similarity to two hypothetical proteins and a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase in Salmonella enterica, (2) KpGI-2, a 6.4 kb island coding for five proteins including a truncated phage-like integrase, two helicase-related proteins, and a homolog of the functionally elusive Fic protein, and (3) KpGI-3, a 12.6 kb island which carried seven fimbriae-related genes, first identified in MGH78578. Consistent with the niche-adaptation hypothesis, KpGI-1-like islands which coded for the putative acetyltransferase were significantly over-represented in sputum isolates as compared to urine (P < 0.001), blood (P < 0.05) or bile (P < 0.05) derived isolates. Despite the unique nature of KpGI-2, likely homologs of orf5_KpGI-2 that coded for Fic were also found at undefined locations in six other clinical isolates, though none possessed the other KpGI-2 genes. We propose that the pheV-associated islands described in this study may contribute to fine tuning and adaptation of K. pneumoniae strains toward preferred infection and/or colonization pathways.
TI  - Planktonic and biofilm communities from 7-day-old chicken cecal microflora cultures: characterization and resistance to Salmonella colonization.
AB  - Information implicating bacterial biofilms as contributory factors in the development of environmental bacterial resistance has been increasing. There is a lack of information regarding the role of biofilms within the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract of food animals. This work used a continuous-flow chemostat model derived from the ceca of 7-day-old chicks to characterize these communities and their ability to neutralize invasion by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We characterized and compared the biofilm and planktonic communities within these microcosms using automated ribotyping and the Analytical Profile Index biotyping system. Eleven species from eight different genera were identified from six culture systems. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from all planktonic communities and four of the biofilm communities. Three of the communities resisted colonization by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, two communities suppressed growth, and one community succumbed to colonization. In cultures that resisted colonization, no Salmonella could be isolated from the biofilm; in cultures that succumbed to colonization, Salmonella was consistently found within the biofilms. This study was one of a series that provided a molecular-based characterization of both the biofilm and planktonic communities from continuous-flow culture systems derived from the cecal microflora of chicks, ranging in age from day-of-hatch to 14 days old. The one common factor relating to successful colonization of the culture was the presence of Salmonella within the biofilm. The capacity to sequester the introduced Salmonella into the biofilm appears to be a contributing factor to the inability of these cultures to withstand colonization by the Salmonella.
TI  - Comparison of the EntericBio multiplex PCR system with routine culture for detection of bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  - The EntericBio system uses a multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli O157 from feces. It combines overnight broth enrichment with PCR amplification and detection by hybridization. An evaluation of this system was conducted by comparing the results obtained with the system with those obtained by routine culture, supplemented with alternative PCR detection methods. In a study of 773 samples, routine culture and the EntericBio system yielded 94.6 and 92.4% negative results, respectively. Forty-two samples had positive results by culture, and all of these were positive with the EntericBio system. This system detected an additional 17 positive samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 12; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 4), but the results for 5 samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 2; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 2) could not be confirmed. The target for Shigella spp. detected by the EntericBio system is the ipaH gene, and the molecular indication of the presence of Shigella spp. was investigated by sequence analysis, which confirmed that the ipaH gene was present in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively. Turnaround times were significantly reduced with the EntericBio system, and a result was available between 24 and 32 h after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. In addition, the amount of laboratory waste was significantly reduced by use of this system. In summary, the EntericBio system proved convenient to use, more sensitive than the conventional culture used in this study, and highly specific; and it generated results significantly faster than routine culture for the pathogens tested.
TI  - Genomic diversity of citrate fermentation in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has long been recognized that Klebsiella pneumoniae can grow anaerobically on citrate. Genes responsible for citrate fermentation of K. pneumoniae were known to be located in a 13-kb gene cluster on the chromosome. By whole genome comparison of the available K. pneumoniae sequences (MGH 78578, 342, and NTUH-K2044), however, we discovered that the fermentation gene cluster was present in MGH 78578 and 342, but absent in NTUH-K2044. In the present study, the previously unknown genome diversity of citrate fermentation among K. pneumoniae clinical isolates was investigated. RESULTS: Using a genomic microarray containing probe sequences from multiple K. pneumoniae strains, we investigated genetic diversity among K. pneumoniae clinical isolates and found that a genomic region containing the citrate fermentation genes was not universally present in all strains. We confirmed by PCR analysis that the gene cluster was detectable in about half of the strains tested. To demonstrate the metabolic function of the genomic region, anaerobic growth of K. pneumoniae in artificial urine medium (AUM) was examined for ten strains with different clinical histories and genomic backgrounds, and the citrate fermentation potential was found correlated with the genomic region. PCR detection of the genomic region yielded high positive rates among a variety of clinical isolates collected from urine, blood, wound infection, and pneumonia. Conserved genetic organizations in the vicinity of the citrate fermentation gene clusters among K. pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli suggest that the 13-kb genomic region were not independently acquired. CONCLUSION: Not all, but nearly half of the K. pneumoniae clinical isolates carry the genes responsible for anaerobic growth on citrate. Genomic variation of citrate fermentation genes in K. pneumoniae may contribute to metabolic diversity and adaptation to variable nutrient conditions in different environments.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and mutagenic investigation of the South African tree aloe (Aloe barberae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: In recent times, many products ranging from aloe drinks to aloe gels, powders, capsules, and creams have appeared on the commercial market prepared from different aloe species including Aloe barberae. These products are used in ethnomedicine to treat various conditions including gastrointestinal disorders, insect bites, skin burns and other skin injuries by traditional communities. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed at evaluating the antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities as well as genotoxic effects of different extracts of Aloe barberae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organic and water extracts of the upper stem, young bark, mature bark, leaves and roots of the South African tree aloe (Aloe barberae) were evaluated for their antimicrobial [gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria as well as the fungus Candida albicans], anti-inflammatory (COX-1 and COX-2) and mutagenic properties (Ames test). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to compare the phytochemical profiles of different extracts of Aloe barberae. RESULTS: The petroleum ether (PE) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of the mature bark, leaves and roots exhibited good activity against all the bacteria and fungus Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.195 to 1.56 mg/ml. All the PE extracts evaluated showed a high activity (>70%) in both COX-1 and COX-2 assays. Apart from the organic extracts of the root with consistently good activity (>70%), all the remaining extracts showed moderate activity (40-69%) in COX-1 assay. The PE extracts also showed a dose dependent increase in activity. Ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the leaves and root EtOH extracts indicated the presence of compounds that could absorb UV light (wavelength: 190-820 nm). None of the extracts had a mutagenic effect in the Salmonella/microsome assay against a tester strain, TA98. CONCLUSION: Activity observed in the bark, leaves and roots of Aloe barberae validates its use in commercial herbal products, ethnobotany and ethnoveterinary medicine by South African communities and small scale farmers to treat various conditions.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of a new cefixime-clavulanic acid combination for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate a new cefixime-clavulanic acid combination for in vitro susceptibility towards gram-negative bacteria. A total of 220 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Acinetobacter spp, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were included in the study. The isolates were tested for susceptibility towards the new combination antimicrobial molecule cefixime with clavulanic acid by disk diffusion and Epsilometer strip (E-strip) Minimum Inhibitary Concentration (MIC) method. Of the 101 E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, 62.4% were found to be extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Almost half of these were from the community and 55.6% were hospital isolates. Of the ESBL isolates, 19% were AmpC (cephalosporinases that are poorly inhibited by beta lactamase inhibitor) producers while the remaining 81% were non AmpC ESBL producers. The AmpC producers were resistant to both cefixime and the combination, while the non-AmpC producers were sensitive to the combination. The addition of clavulanate to cefixime did not improve the sensitivities of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter isolates. There were no ESBL isolates among the S. Typhi isolates, all of which were sensitive to cefixime. Of the S. Typhimurium, 88.9% were ESBL producers and all of these were resistant to cefixime but sensitive to the combination. The combination of cefixime with clavulanic acid offers the advantage of oral administration and appears to be a viable option for the treatment of uncomplicated community acquired infections caused by non-AmpC ESBL producing gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. To focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in Caco-2BBe and NCI-H292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. Confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of Shigella sonnei, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae particles. Endocytosed Staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for Yersinia, suggesting that cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. Interestingly, when Staphylococcus and Yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up Yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of Staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. Cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of NCI-H292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked uptake of both Yersinia and Staphylococcus in NCI-H292 and Caco-2BBe cells. Our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Interleukin-17 in host defence against bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - The mammalian immune system is intricately regulated, allowing for potent pathogen-specific immunity to be rapidly activated in response to infection with a broad and diverse array of potential pathogens. As a result of their ability to differentiate into distinct effector lineages, CD4 T cells significantly contribute to pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Through the production of effector cytokines, CD4 T helper (Th) cells orchestrate the precise mobilization of specific immune cells to eradicate infection. The protective effects of the newly identified lineage of Th17 cells against pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter rodentium and Candida albicans indicate the capacity of Th17 cells to confer protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, filling a critical void in host immunity not covered by the classically described Th1 lineage that activates immunity to intracellular pathogens or the Th2 lineage that is important in protection against mucosal parasitic pathogens. Host defence by Th17 cells extends beyond protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, as demonstrated in infections against intracellular bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, we summarize both experimental data from mouse infection models and epidemiological studies in humans that demonstrate the protective effects of interleukin-17 and Th17 CD4 T cells in immunity to bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.
TI  - CMY-31 and CMY-36 cephalosporinases encoded by ColE1-like plasmids.
AB  - Two CMY-2 derivatives, CMY-31 (Gln(215)-->Arg) from Salmonella enterica serotype  Newport and CMY-36 (Ala(77)-->Cys and Gln(193)-->Glu) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, were characterized. Both cephalosporinases functionally resembled CMY-2. bla(CMY) alleles occurred as parts of a putative transposon comprising ISEcp1B and a Citrobacter freundii-derived sequence carried by ColE1-like plasmids similar to CMY-5-encoding pTKH11 from Klebsiella oxytoca.
TI  - Microflora of bile aspirates in patients with acute cholecystitis with or without cholelithiasis: a tropical experience.
AB  - The current study determined the spectrum of biliary microflora with special emphasis on enteric fever organisms in patients with acute cholangitis with and without cholelithiasis or other biliary diseases. The patients were divided into three groups: Group A consisted of patients with acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis; Group B consisted of patients with acute cholecystitis with gastrointestinal ailments requiring biliary drainage and group C consisted of patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Gallbladder, bile and gallstones were subjected to complete microbiological and histopathological examination. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was performed as per CLSI guidelines. Bacteria were recovered from 17 samples (32%) in Group A, 17 (51.4%) in Group B and 1 (1.6%) in Group C. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (11, 29.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10, 27%), Citrobacter freundii (3, 8.1%), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (3, 8.1%), etc. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem. As regards Salmonella spp., S. Typhi was isolated from 2 (3.8%) patients in Group A and 1 (16%) in Group C. Antimicrobial susceptibility of potential causative organisms, the severity of the cholecystitis, and the local susceptibility pattern must be taken into consideration when prescribing drugs. A protocol regarding the management of such cases should be formulated based on observations of similar studies.
TI  - Membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. Modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. These phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a Multi Drug Resistant phenotype (MDR). In Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of MDR isolates. These bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). The combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. MarA and ramA are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the MDR phenotype. Mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. In addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the MDR response. This phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. These effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, marA, ramA, or target other genes located downstream in the regulation cascade.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Antibacterial terpenes from the oleo-resin of Commiphora molmol (Engl.).
AB  - Two octanordammaranes, mansumbinone (1) and 3,4-seco-mansumbinoic acid (2), and two sesquiterpenes, beta-elemene (3) and T-cadinol (4) have been isolated from the oleo-resin of Commiphora molmol (Engl.). The structures of these compounds were established unambiguously by a series of 1D and 2D-NMR analyses. We have also unambiguously assigned all (1)H and (13)C NMR resonances for 2 and revised its (13)C data. The crude extract of the oleo-resin of C. molmol displayed potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline against S. aureus, several Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains and two K. pneumoniae strains. The antibacterial activity of terpenes 1-4 was determined against a number of Staphylococcus aureus strains: SA1199B, ATCC25923, XU212, RN4220 and EMRSA15 and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be in the range of 4-256 microg/ml. The highest activity was observed by the seco-A-ring octanordammarane 2 with an MIC of 4 microg/ml against SA1199B, a multidrug-resistant strain which over-expresses the NorA efflux transporter, the major characterized antibiotic pump in this species. This activity compared favorably to the antibiotic norfloxacin with an MIC of 32 microg/ml. Compound 2 also displayed weak potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline activity against strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 and L10.
TI  - Probing structure-activity relationships in bactericidal peptide betapep-25.
AB  - Cationic peptides, known to disrupt bacterial membranes, are being developed as promising agents for therapeutic intervention against infectious disease. In the present study, we investigate structure-activity relationships in the bacterial membrane disruptor betapep-25, a peptide 33-mer. For insight into which amino acid residues are functionally important, we synthesized alanine-scanning variants of betapep-25 and assessed their ability to kill bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) and to neutralize LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Activity profiles were found to vary with the bacterial strain examined. Specific cationic and smaller hydrophobic alkyl residues were crucial to optimal bactericidal activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, whereas larger hydrophobic and cationic residues mediated optimal activity against Gram-positive Staph. aureus. Lysine-substituted norleucine (n-butyl group) variants demonstrated that both charge and alkyl chain length mediate optimal activity. In terms of LPS neutralization, activity profiles were essentially the same against four species of LPS (E. coli 055 and 0111, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae), and different for two others (Ps. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens), with specific hydrophobic, cationic and, surprisingly, anionic residues being functionally important. Furthermore, disulfide-bridged analogues demonstrated that an anti parallel beta-sheet structure is the bioactive conformation of betapep-25 in terms of its bactericidal, but not LPS endotoxin neutralizing, activity. Moreover, betapep-25 variants, like the parent peptide, do not lyse eukaryotic cells. This research contributes to the development and design of novel antibiotics.
TI  - Investigation of four (99m)Tc-labeled bacteriophages for infection-specific imaging.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated radiolabeled bacteriophages for specific detection of infection through gamma imaging. Previously, a (99m)Tc-labeled M13 phage demonstrated specific binding for its host Escherichia coli in vitro and in mice through imaging. METHODS: This study was extended to phages P22, E79, VD-13 and phage 60. Each was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc using the chelator MAG(3), and were evaluated for binding to host and non-host bacteria in vitro and in a mouse infection model. RESULTS: In vitro, each (99m)Tc-phage bound to its host at least 4-fold higher than to non-host bacteria. For example, (99m)Tc-E79 showed 10- to 20-fold greater binding to host Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to non-host Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, and (99m)Tc-phage 60 showed 20-fold greater binding to host Klebsiella pneumoniae over non-hosts. Mice received host or non-host bacteria in one thigh, and 3 h later, the (99m)Tc-phages were administered intravenously. After a further 3 h, the tissues were counted. Liver accumulation was highest for (99m)Tc-E79, averaging 39% compared to an average of 13% for the other (99m)Tc-phages. Animals infected with host bacteria showed infected thigh/normal thigh ratios of 14.2 for (99m)Tc-E79, 2.9 for (99m)Tc-P22, 3.5 for (99m)Tc-VD-13 and 2.1 for (99m)Tc-phage 60. CONCLUSIONS: Although specific host binding was observed in vitro for each of these four (99m)Tc-phages, only (99m)Tc-E79 showed specificity for its host in an in vivo model.
TI  - Characterization of TEM-, SHV- and AmpC-type beta-lactamases from cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from swine.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing problem in human medicine and an emerging problem in the veterinary field. Our study, therefore, focused on assessing the prevalence of beta-lactamases isolated from swine. Sixty-six Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), 33 Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), 26 Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumoniae) and 130 Escherichia coli (E. coli) pig isolates collected from 1999-2006 were screened for beta-lactam resistance by the disk diffusion test (DDT) and micro-broth dilution. Among the isolates, five E. coli and five K. pneumoniae exhibited reduced susceptibility to the cephalosporins tested. PCR, plasmid profiling and Southern blot hybridization showed the presence of multiple beta-lactamases in these isolates of animal origin. Hybridization patterns of the DHA-1 specific probe indicated that dissemination of DHA-1 related beta-lactamases could be attributed to plasmids of one common size among the enteric microbes of animal origin. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first identification of SHV-28 and DHA-1 from microbes of animal origin.
TI  - Analogous oligo-acyl-lysines with distinct antibacterial mechanisms.
AB  - Bactericidal properties were recently shown to emerge from hydrophobicity and charge buildup in oligo-acyl-lysine (OAK) peptide mimetics. Toward understanding the attributes that govern the activity of this novel antimicrobial system, we compared the functional and mechanistic properties of a known octamer and a newly generated hexamer analog. The data provide strong evidence for multiple similarities that included high tissue stability, low hemolysis, large-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and the ability to prevent Escherichia coli-induced mortality in vivo. Despite these similarities, however, the octamer mode of action involved membrane disruption, unlike the hexamer, which acted predominantly through inhibition of DNA functions with characteristically slower bactericidal kinetics. Collectively, the data support the view that the analogous OAKs induced bacterial death by distinct mechanisms and further suggest that relatively minor differences in the sequence of host defense peptides are responsible for selecting one mechanism over another, possibly in conjunction with differential binding affinities to the external and/or cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pOLA52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in Enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Invasiveness and intracellular growth of multidrug-resistant salmonella and other pathogens in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens of human and animal origins is a major public health concern. For a better understanding of the health consequences of multidrug-resistant bacteria transmitted from animal products to humans, the host interaction of zoonotic Salmonella isolates along with other pathogenic and commensal bacteria was evaluated using a human intestinal Caco-2 cell system. Multidrug-resistant S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, and S. Typhimurium possessed plasmid-mediated class 1 integrons. The S. Typhimurium DT104 isolate from ground beef showed the well-known genotypic and phenotypic resistance characteristics of the species, and contained the chromosomally located class 1 integron. Among the multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates, the S. Heidelberg 219 had the highest invasion number at 1.0 x 10(4) CFU/mL, followed by the S. Typhimurium DT104 isolate at 7.7 x 10(3) CFU/mL. Listeria monocytogenes was the best performer among the tested species in invading the Caco-2 cell. Multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also able to invade the cells. The invasion of S. Heidelberg 219, S. Typhimurium DT104, L. monocytogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa into the Caco-2 cells was not affected even in the presence of commensal E. coli. During the intracellular growth of S. Heidelberg 219, S. Typhimurium DT104, and L. monocytogenes, the bacterial counts increased 2 log cycles in 9 h in the Caco-2 cells. Therefore, these strains could rapidly proliferate after their invasion into the cells.
TI  - Prevalence of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. producing multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Eleven thousand two hundred seventy-two Escherichia coli, 1109 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1124 Salmonella enterica, and 602 Klebsiella oxytoca unrelated clinical isolates were obtained between 2001 and 2004 in a university hospital in Salamanca, Spain. One hundred thirteen E. coli (1%), 32 K. pneumoniae (2.9%), 4 K. oxytoca (0.66%), and 5 S. enterica (0.44%) isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). We obtained 42.2% of the ESBL-producing isolates from outpatients and 57.8% from inpatients. The most commonly detected ESBLs were CTX-M 14 (43.5% of ESBL-producing isolates), TEM-116 (22.1%), and SHV-2 (15.6%). A CTX-M 27-producing E. coli is 1st reported in Spain in this study. Two (20 isolates, 13%) or 3 (7 isolates, 4.5%) ESBLs were produced by 17.5% of ESBL-producing isolates (27 isolates). The most frequent combinations were CTX-M 14 + TEM-116 (5.7%), SHV-12 + TEM-116 (2.6%), and SHV-2 + CTX-M 14 + TEM-116 (2.6%). Clonal diversity was high even between isolates producing the same combinations of 2 or 3 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of foodservice surfaces in Texas child-care centers.
AB  - Children under the age of 5 years experience a disproportionately high rate of bacterial enteric infections. Research has shown a relationship between inadequate child-care center sanitation and illnesses in children. This cross-sectional study assessed the sanitation levels of foodservice surfaces in a sample of 36 Texas child-care centers via recovery and identification of selected enteric gram-negative bacteria. The centers in this study had the capacity to care for 50 to 332 children and represented diverse socioeconomic and racial profiles. Forty-one percent (68 of 167) of total swab samples collected tested positive for bacteria. Twenty-seven different types of bacteria were identified from positive swab samples. Most of the bacteria found are considered opportunistic pathogens, which can pose serious health risks to those with compromised immune systems, such as young children. Two types of bacteria recovered, Salmonella paratyphi A and Klebsiella pneumonia, are considered nonopportunistic and can infect healthy individuals. The most common areas of bacterial contamination were the sink drain area of the dishwashing sink, the hand-washing sink faucet handles, the handle of the garbage can lid, and cutting boards. It is vital for child-care staff to wash their hands often and disinfect all surfaces, because even surfaces that appear clean can harbor microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - Characterisation of plasmids encoding CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from Enterobacteriaceae isolated at a university hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - CTX-M-3 is the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase produced by Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan. The present study was conducted to characterise the genetic environment surrounding bla(CTX-M-3). A total of 11 ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were studied: Escherichia coli (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=5) and Salmonella enterica serotypes Anatum (SA831R) and Potsdam (SC72). Molecular methods used included polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, DNA-DNA hybridisation, conjugation, physical mapping and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. All isolates examined carried bla(CTX-M-3) on large plasmids (>70kb). The resistance plasmids of the two Salmonella and two K. pneumoniae strains (KP104 and KP116) were confirmed to be conjugative in vitro. RFLP analysis indicated that the plasmids were different. Physical mapping also revealed the difference between the two Salmonella plasmids, pSA831R (82kb) and pSC72 (74kb). An insertion sequence, ISEcp1, was found upstream of each bla(CTX-M-3) gene. However, sequencing of downstream regions of the bla genes showed two different patterns: the presence of orf477 in pSA831R and of orf1-mucA in pSC72, pKP104 and pKP116. IncI1-type oriT and nikA sequences were present in the plasmids of all the clinical isolates tested, except S. Anatum. Different bla(CTX-M-3)-carrying plasmids were identified among the enterobacteria studied. The presence of ISEcp1 in all isolates may be associated with the widespread resistance among Enterobacteriaceae. Although the plasmids were not identical, they appeared to belong to the same incompatibility group (IncI1-like plasmids), suggesting that they are genetically related but may have evolved divergently over time.
TI  - Biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium phage type DT104 and other pathogens.
AB  - The biofilm-forming capability of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Heidelberg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from humans, animal farms, and retail meat products was evaluated by using a microplate assay. The tested bacterial species showed interstrain variation in their capabilities to form biofilms. Strong biofilm-forming strains of S. enterica serotypes, E. coli O157: H7, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were resistant to at least four of the tested antibiotics. To understand their potential in forming biofilms in food-processing environments, the strong biofilm formers grown in beef, turkey, and lettuce broths were further investigated on stainless steel and glass surfaces. Among the tested strains, Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT104 (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104) isolated from retail beef formed the strongest biofilm on stainless steel and glass in beef and turkey broths. K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, and P. aeruginosa were also able to form strong biofilms on the tested surface materials. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 developed a biofilm on stainless steel in beef and turkey broths through (i) initial attachment to the surface, (ii) formation of microcolonies, and (iii) biofilm maturation. These findings indicated that Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 alongwith other bacterial pathogens could be a source of cross-contamination during handling and processing of food.
TI  - Searching for bacterial lysozyme inhibitors.
AB  
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of pK245, a 98-kilobase plasmid conferring quinolone resistance and extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase activity in a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate.
AB  - A plasmid containing the qnrS quinolone resistance determinant and the gene encoding the SHV-2 beta-lactamase has been discovered from a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in Taiwan. The complete 98-kb sequence of this plasmid, designated pK245, was determined by using a whole-genome shotgun approach. Transfer of pK245 conferred low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in electroporant Escherichia coli epi300. The sequence of the immediate region surrounding qnrS in pK245 is nearly identical (>99% identity) to those of pAH0376 from Shigella flexneri and pINF5 from Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis, the two other qnrS-carrying plasmids reported to date, indicating a potential common origin. Other genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (aacC2, strA, and strB), chloramphenicol (catA2), sulfonamides (sul2), tetracycline (tetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA14) were also detected in pK245. The dfrA14 gene is carried on a class I integron. Several features of this plasmid, including three separate regions containing putative replicons, a partitioning-control system, and a type II restriction modification system, suggest that it may be able to replicate and adapt in a variety of hosts. Although no critical conjugative genes were detected, multiple insertion sequence elements were found scattered throughout pK245, and these may facilitate the dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance determinants. We conclude that pK245 is a chimera which acquired its multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants horizontally from different sources. The identification of pK245 plasmid expands the repertoire of the coexistence of quinolone and extended-spectrum-beta-lactam resistance determinants in plasmids carried by various species of the family Enterobacteriaceae in different countries.
TI  - Morphine withdrawal lowers host defense to enteric bacteria: spontaneous sepsis and increased sensitivity to oral Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection.
AB  - Understanding the consequences of drug withdrawal on immune function and host defense to infection is important. We, and others, previously demonstrated that morphine withdrawal results in immunosuppression and sensitizes to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. In the present study, the effect of morphine withdrawal on spontaneous sepsis and on oral infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was examined. Mice were chronically exposed to morphine for 96 h by implantation of a slow-release morphine pellet. Abrupt withdrawal was induced by removal of the pellet. In the sepsis model, bacterial colonization was examined and bacterial species were identified by necropsy of various tissues. It was found that at 48 h postwithdrawal, morphine-treated mice had enteric bacteria that were detected in the Peyer's patches (4/5), mesenteric lymph nodes (4/5), spleens (4/10), livers (6/10), and peritoneal cavities (8/10). In placebo pellet-withdrawn mice, only 2/40 cultures were positive. The most frequently detected organisms in tissues of morphine-withdrawn mice were Enterococcus faecium followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both organisms are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora. In the infection model, mice were orally inoculated with S. enterica 24 h post-initiation of abrupt withdrawal from morphine. Withdrawal significantly decreased the mean survival time and significantly increased the Salmonella burden in various tissues of infected mice compared to placebo-withdrawn animals. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were observed in spleens of morphine-withdrawn mice, compared to placebo-withdrawn mice. These findings demonstrate that morphine withdrawal sensitizes to oral infection with a bacterial pathogen and predisposes mice to bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Two transsulfurylation pathways in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - In most bacteria, inorganic sulfur is assimilated into cysteine, which provides sulfur for methionine biosynthesis via transsulfurylation. Here, cysteine is transferred to the terminal carbon of homoserine via its sulfhydryl group to form cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. In the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, these reactions are catalyzed by irreversible cystathionine-gamma-synthase and cystathionine-beta-lyase enzymes. Alternatively, yeast and some bacteria assimilate sulfur into homocysteine, which serves as a sulfhydryl group donor in the synthesis of cysteine by reverse transsulfurylation with a cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-lyase. Herein we report that the related enteric bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae encodes genes for both transsulfurylation pathways; genetic and biochemical analyses show that they are coordinately regulated to prevent futile cycling. Klebsiella uses reverse transsulfurylation to recycle methionine to cysteine during periods of sulfate starvation. This methionine-to-cysteine (mtc) transsulfurylation pathway is activated by cysteine starvation via the CysB protein, by adenosyl-phosphosulfate starvation via the Cbl protein, and by methionine excess via the MetJ protein. While mtc mutants cannot use methionine as a sulfur source on solid medium, they will utilize methionine in liquid medium via a sulfide intermediate, suggesting that an additional nontranssulfurylation methionine-to-cysteine recycling pathway(s) operates under these conditions.
TI  - Bafoudiosbulbins A, and B, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from Dioscorea bulbifera L. var sativa.
AB  - Two clerodane diterpenoids, Bafoudiosbulbins A 1, and B 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of Dioscorea bulbifera L. var sativa. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D-NMR, MS) and X-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. The CH2Cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella paratyphi B. They both showed significant activities against P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B.
TI  - qnr prevalence in ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the United States.
AB  - We screened 313 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained in the United States from 1999 to 2004 for all three known qnr genes. A qnr gene was present in 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 31% of Enterobacter sp. isolates, and 4% of Escherichia coli isolates. qnrA and qnrB occurred with equivalent frequencies and, except for qnrB in enterobacters, were stable over time. qnrS was absent.
TI  - Dissemination and persistence of blaCTX-M-9 are linked to class 1 integrons containing CR1 associated with defective transposon derivatives from Tn402 located in early antibiotic resistance plasmids of IncHI2, IncP1-alpha, and IncFI groups.
AB  - This study analyzes the diversity of In60, a class 1 integron bearing CR1 and containing bla(CTX-M-9), and its association with Tn402, Tn21, and classical conjugative plasmids among 45 CTX-M-9-producing clinical strains (41 Escherichia coli strains, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 1 Salmonella enterica strain, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae strain). Forty-five patients in a Spanish tertiary care hospital were studied (1996 to 2003). The diversity of In60 and association of In60 with Tn402 or mercury resistance transposons were investigated by overlapping PCR assays and/or hybridization. Plasmid characterization included comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and determination of incompatibility group by PCR-based replicon typing, sequencing, and hybridization. CTX-M-9 plasmids belonged to IncHI2 (n = 26), IncP-1alpha (n = 10), IncFI (n = 4), and IncI (n = 1) groups. Genetic platforms containing bla(CTX-M-9) were classified in six types in relation to the In60 backbone and in eight subtypes in relation to Tn402 derivatives. They were associated with Tn21 sequences when located in IncP-1alpha or IncHI2 plasmids. Our study identified bla(CTX-M-9) in a high diversity of CR1-bearing class 1 integrons linked to different Tn402 derivatives, often to Tn21, highlighting the role of recombination events in the evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids. The presence of bla(CTX-M-9) on broad-host-range IncP-1alpha plasmids might contribute to its dissemination to hosts that were not members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Replicon typing of plasmids encoding resistance to newer beta-lactams.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing represents a novel method to describe the dissemination and follow the evolution of resistance plasmids. We used this approach to study 26 epidemiologically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae and demonstrate the dominance of incompatibility (Inc) A/C or Inc N-related plasmids carrying some emerging resistance determinants to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of  the major causes of haemorrhagic colitis in humans, were produced by immunising Balb/c mice with the strain E. coli O157:H7. These monoclonal antibodies do not cross-react with other bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, E. coli O14, E. coli JM109, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. panama, S. saintpaul, S. derby, S. muenchen, S. bredeney, S. hadar, Yersinia enterocolitica, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri, Listeria ivanovii, L. monocytogenes 13M, L. innocua, Enterobacter cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. amnigenus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia fergussoni or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the seven MAbs obtained, MAb 8B8C3 was selected to prepare a high-sensitivity sandwich ELISA method specific for O157:H7.
TI  - [Transference of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to other species of Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important pathogenic bacterium, frequently isolated from nosocomial samples, that exhibits wide antimicrobial resistance profiles, including third generation cephalosporins (3GC), aminoglycosides and quinolones. The resistance to 3GC is mainly due to the synthesis of extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL), encoded by conjugative plasmids. AIM: To investigate the potential transference of resistance to 3GC from nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae to other clinical strains of various species of Enterobacteriaceae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mating experiments were carried out in liquid media and three nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae were used as donors. These strains were ESBL-producers and resistant to, at least, one of the 3GC assayed. One strain of Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli, isolated from clinical specimens, were used as recipients. The presence of bla genes was investigated by PCR. RESULTS: The three nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae were able to transfer the resistance to 3GC and the genes encoding the ESBL to the susceptible recipient strains of enterobacteria. The frequency of transference was as high as 3.2 x 10-2 transconjugants/recipient cell when the strain of Citrobacter freundii was used as recipient. All transconjugants exhibited high level of resistance to the 3GC assayed. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of K. pneumoniae isolated from Chilean hospitals are able to disseminate the ESBL genes to clinical strains of others species of Enterobacteriaaceae.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel Vi conjugate vaccine in a murine model of salmonellosis.
AB  - Immunisation of BALB/c mice with a vaccine containing Vi polysaccharide conjugated to the Klebsiella pneumoniae outer membrane 40 kDa protein (rP40), in combination with Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin adjuvant (LT), elicited anti-Vi IgG antibodies after administration using different routes. Testing of the immune serum in opsonisation assays demonstrated the specific enhancement of Vi-positive bacterial uptake by cultured murine bone marrow derived macrophages. Intra-peritoneal challenge of mice immunised with the Vi-based vaccine elicited a degree of protection against virulent Vi+ Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium). In contrast, Vi vaccination did not confer protection against oral challenge with virulent Vi-positive S. typhimurium or S. dublin.
TI  - Bacterial endotoxin as inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of human thrombin.
AB  - Endotoxemia caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) deleteriously affects many aspects of hemostasis. Much of this effect is well characterized as being secondary to the LPS-mediated inflammatory response, but direct effects of LPS on coagulation factors may also contribute to disregulation of the hemostatic process. Spectrophotometric assays were used to investigate the effects of LPS from different bacteria on thrombin and plasmin activities. We found that enzymatic activity of purified thrombin, but not plasmin, decreases in the presence of endotoxin. LPS-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity can be reversed by plasma gelsolin and recombinant endotoxin-neutralizing protein. Preincubation of thrombin with LPS before platelet activation results in inhibition of aggregation and secretion. Additionally, a decrease of elastic shear moduli of fibrin gels was observed when their formation was induced with thrombin preincubated with LPS or when LPS was present in fibrinogen solutions during fibrin gel formation. When added to platelet-rich plasma, after activation with collagen, LPS-inhibited thrombin activity. LPS-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity may contribute to the hemostasis dysfunctions observed during endotoxemia.
TI  - KmrA multidrug efflux pump from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - We cloned a gene responsible for multidrug resistance from the chromosomal DNA of Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578 that showed multidrug resistance. We designated the gene kmrA. The deduced amino acid sequence of KmrA was similar to that of SmvA that is responsible for methyl viologen-resistance in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhi and Typhimurium. Introduction of the cloned kmrA gene into drug-hypersensitive Escherichia coli KAM32 cells made them resistant to acriflavine, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Hoechst 33342, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPCl), methyl viologen and ethidium bromide. We observed elevated energy-dependent efflux of ethidium in E. coli cells carrying the kmrA gene compared with control cells. We also cloned the smvA gene from S. enterica sv. Typhimurium LT2 and investigated the resistance pattern for several drugs. The pattern was similar between KmrA from K. pneumoniae and SmvA from S. enterica.
TI  - [Pleural empyema due to Salmonella typhi].
AB  - 65 years old female was admitted to hospital with fever, purulent sputum and dyspnea. The patient has hepatic cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunosuppressive treatment is used for autoimmune hepatitis. In physical examination matute and diminished respiratory sounds were determined at right hemithorax. Ascitis was determined in abdominal examination. Chest X-ray showed pleural effusion in right hemithorax. Serohemorrhagic fluid was aspirated by thoraco-synthesis. Pleural fluid pH was 6.9 and had an exudative nature. The patient was the diagnosed as empyema. Right tube thoracostomy was performed and sulbactam-ampicillin 6 g/day therapy was started. In patient's ascite fluid no bacteria and leucocytes was seen. Salmonella typhi was isolated from pleural fluid. No microorganisms were isolated from ascite fluid, urine and stool culture. Klebsiella pneumoniae is isolated in patient's hemoculture. Clinical improving was detected. Chest X-ray showed total regression of pleural fluid and the tube thoracostomy removed. We presented this case because of rarely seen microorganism (S. typhi) in immunocompromised patients a cause of pleural empyema which is frequently seen gastrointestinal infections.
TI  - Emergence of DHA-1-producing Klebsiella spp. in the Parisian region: genetic organization of the ampC and ampR genes originating from Morganella morganii.
AB  - Eleven Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and one Klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate showing various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types and producing an inducible DHA-1 class C beta-lactamase were isolated in the Parisian region between 1998 and 2003. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic organization of the bla(DHA-1) genes in this collection of clinical isolates. In four isolates, the Morganella morganii-derived genomic region containing bla(DHA-1) was inserted in an entire complex sul1-type integron, including a region common to In6-In7 (CR1), as previously described in a bla(DHA-1)-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis KF92 isolate from Saudi Arabia in 1992. Different gene cassette arrays were characterized in each of these integrons. In two of them, an additional 10-kb fragment was inserted between the CR1 and the M. morganii-derived region and was similar to the sap (ABC transporter family) and psp (phage shock protein) operons originated from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The length of the M. morganii region was variable, suggesting that several independent recombination events have occurred and that open reading frame orf513 encodes a recombinase involved in the mobilization of the resistance genes. The genetic organization of bla(DHA-1) was identical in the eight other isolates. This structure is likely derived from a complex integron following the insertion of IS26, leading to the deletion of the first part of integron. The horizontal transfer of one plasmid carrying that truncated integron was shown for seven of these isolates.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Equisetum arvense L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the sterile stems of Equisetum arvense L. (Equisetaceae) were investigated for the first time using GC, GC/MS and (13)C-NMR. Twenty-five compounds were identified. Hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (18.34%), cis-geranyl acetone (13.74%), thymol (12.09%) and trans-phytol (10.06%) were the major constituents. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of this oil against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enteritidis; fungi: Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). The 1:10 dilution of the essential oil of Equisetum arvense L. was shown to possess a broad spectrum of a very strong antimicrobial activity against all tested strains.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - The distinct binding specificities exhibited by enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae are determined by their fimbrial shafts.
AB  - Type 1 fimbriae of enterobacteria are heteropolymeric organelles of adhesion composed of FimH, a mannose-binding lectin, and a shaft composed primarily of FimA. We compared the binding activities of recombinant clones expressing type 1 fimbriae from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium for gut and uroepithelial cells and for various soluble mannosylated proteins. Each fimbria was characterized by its capacity to bind particular epithelial cells and to aggregate mannoproteins. However, when each respective FimH subunit was cloned and expressed in the absence of its shaft as a fusion protein with MalE, each FimH bound a wide range of mannose-containing compounds. In addition, we found that expression of FimH on a heterologous fimbrial shaft, e.g. K. pneumoniae FimH on the E. coli fimbrial shaft or vice versa, altered the binding specificity of FimH such that it closely resembled that of the native heterologous type 1 fimbriae. Furthermore, attachment to and invasion of bladder epithelial cells, which were mediated much better by native E. coli type 1 fimbriae compared with native K. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae, were found to be dependent on the background of the fimbrial shaft (E. coli versus K. pneumoniae) rather than the background of the FimH expressed. Thus, the distinct binding specificities of different enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae cannot be ascribed solely to the primary structure of their respective FimH subunits, but are also modulated by the fimbrial shaft on which each FimH subunit is presented, possibly through conformational constraints imposed on FimH by the fimbrial shaft. The capacity of type 1 fimbrial shafts to modulate the tissue tropism of different enterobacterial species represents a novel function for these highly organized structures.
TI  - Designer antibacterial peptides kill fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - A significant number of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains in urinary tract infections are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Peptide antibiotics are viable alternatives although these are usually either toxic or insufficiently active. By applying multiple alignment and sequence optimization steps, we designed multifunctional proline-rich antibacterial peptides that maintained their DnaK-binding ability in bacteria and low toxicity in eukaryotes, but entered bacterial cells much more avidly than earlier peptide derivatives. The resulting chimeric and statistical analogues exhibited 8-32 microg/mL minimal inhibitory concentration efficacies in Muller-Hinton broth against a series of clinical pathogens. Significantly, the best peptide, compound 5, A3-APO, retained full antibacterial activity in the presence of mouse serum. Across a set of eight fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates, peptide 5 was 4 times more potent than ciprofloxacin. On the basis of the in vitro efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics data, we estimate that peptide 5 will be suitable for treating infections in the 3-5 mg/kg dose range.
TI  - Role of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in determining susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415 (MIC range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however, on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Insertional inactivation of the H. influenzae acrB or tolC gene in strain NB65044 (Rd strain KW20) increased susceptibility to LBM415, confirming a role for the AcrAB-TolC pump in determining resistance. Consistent with this, sequencing of a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the acrRA region from an LBM415-hypersusceptible H. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acrA. Inactivation of acrB or tolC in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to LBM415 (MIC of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. Examination of acrR, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. Supporting this, NB65044 acrR mutants selected by exposure to LBM415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to LBM415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime in clinical isolates  of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis in Hong Kong.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the genetic determinants involved in the reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime in Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis clinical isolates obtained from four patients in summer 2003 in Hong Kong. METHODS: Three Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from blood culture and one from stool were collected due to their increased resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. PFGE analysis was used to investigate their genetic relatedness. Conjugation experiments were employed to show if the genetic determinants involved were plasmid-mediated. MICs of various antimicrobials were determined by VITEK 2 and Etest. Based on the susceptibility and conjugation experiment results, previously described PCR methods were employed to detect sequences homologous to qnr and bla(CTX-M) suspected to be involved in the reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime, respectively. RESULTS: PFGE analysis showed that the four Salmonella isolates were clonally unrelated. The presence of a qnr-like gene and the CTX-M allele bla(CTX-M-14) on four different transferable plasmids harboured by the four isolates was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of transferable fluoroquinolone resistance due to a new qnr allele, which appeared to be linked to bla(CTX-M-14), in isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis in Hong Kong.
TI  - Accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  - A microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. Representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were printed on a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. Within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. This approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.
TI  - Worldwide disseminated armA aminoglycoside resistance methylase gene is borne by  composite transposon Tn1548.
AB  - The armA (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene, which confers resistance to  4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin, was initially found in Klebsiella pneumoniae BM4536 on IncL/M plasmid pIP1204 of ca. 90 kb which also encodes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-3. Thirty-four enterobacteria from various countries that were likely to produce a CTX-M enzyme since they were more resistant to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime were studied. The armA gene was detected in 12 clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella flexneri, in which it was always associated with bla(CTX-M-3) on an IncL/M plasmid. Conjugation, analysis of DNA sequences, PCR mapping, and plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the armA gene was part of composite transposon Tn1548 together with genes ant3"9, sul1, and dfrXII, which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. The 16.6-kb genetic element was flanked by two copies of IS6 and migrated by replicative transposition. This observation accounts for the presence of armA on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its worldwide dissemination. It thus appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16S rRNA confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides except streptomycin in gram-negative human and animal pathogens.
TI  - Distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  - Bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, B, C, and D, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. There are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene B (homology to ubiX) and C (ubiD) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene D, are not numerous ( approximately 15). The occurrence of the entire BCD gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement CDB), Streptomyces sp. D7, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica, S. paratyphi, S. typhimurium, S. bongori, and S. diarizonae. The corresponding genes from S. hydroxybenzoicus, B. subtilis, Streptomyces sp. D7, E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in E. coli DH5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north India.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 1 year from August 2003 to July 2004. Among the 567 qualifying samples, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), Escherichia coli (15.17%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria other than Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. Staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and Enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria other than other Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. Among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against Enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. However, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all Gram-negative isolates. For Gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus spp. Combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for Gram-negative pathogens. Hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - The effect of electron beam irradiation on the survival of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on raw chicken breasts stored at four degrees celsius for fourteen days.
AB  - The effect of high-energy electron beam irradiation on the survival of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on commercial chicken breast meat was evaluated. Fresh chicken breast meat was purchased from a local poultry processor, inoculated with 8 log10 cfu/mL Salmonella, packaged in Styrofoam trays and over wrapped with a polyvinyl chloride film, and subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 kGy of irradiation. The packaged samples were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed for Salmonella Typhimurium and psychrotrophic organisms at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d of storage. Direct plating and enrichment methods were used for S. Typhimurium analyses. The direct plating method revealed a 4 log reduction in Salmonella for chicken breasts inoculated and treated with 1, 2, or 3 kGy of irradiation. Psychrotrophic counts were conducted at 7 degrees C for 10 d and 25 degrees C for 5 d to determine the effect of incubation methods on the recovery of psychrotrophic organisms. The enrichment method resulted in the repair of injured Salmonella cells and an elevated Salmonella Typhimurium count for all irradiation dosages when compared with data reported for the direct plating method. In general, psychrotrophic counts increased as storage time increased. However, psychrotrophic counts decreased (P < 0.05) as the irradiation dosage increased.
TI  - Characterization of Gla(KP), a UDP-galacturonic acid C4-epimerase from Klebsiella pneumoniae with extended substrate specificity.
AB  - In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, the core oligosaccharide backbone of the lipopolysaccharide is modified by phosphoryl groups. The negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. In contrast, Klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl groups in its core oligosaccharide but instead contains galacturonic acid residues that are proposed to serve a similar function in outer membrane stability. Gla(KP) is a UDP-galacturonic acid C4-epimerase that provides UDP-galacturonic acid for core synthesis, and the enzyme was biochemically characterized because of its potentially important role in outer membrane stability. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used to demonstrate the UDP-galacturonic acid C4-epimerase activity of Gla(KP), and capillary electrophoresis was used for activity assays. The reaction equilibrium favors UDP-galacturonic acid over UDP-glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.4:1, with the K(m) for UDP-glucuronic acid of 13.0 microM. Gla(KP) exists as a dimer in its native form. NAD+/NADH is tightly bound by the enzyme and addition of supplementary NAD+ is not required for activity of the purified enzyme. Divalent cations have an unexpected inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. Gla(KP) was found to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro; it is capable of interconverting UDP-glucose/UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine/UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, albeit at much lower activity. The epimerase GalE interconverts UDP-glucose/UDP-galactose. Multicopy plasmid-encoded gla(KP) partially complemented a galE mutation in S. enterica and in K. pneumoniae; however, chromosomal gla(KP) could not substitute for galE in a K. pneumoniae galE mutant in vivo.
TI  - Defective O-antigen polymerization in tolA and pal mutants of Escherichia coli in response to extracytoplasmic stress.
AB  - We have previously shown that the TolA protein is required for the correct surface expression of the Escherichia coli O7 antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this work, delta tolA and delta pal mutants of E. coli K-12 W3110 were transformed with pMF19 (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase that reconstitutes the expression of O16-specific LPS), pWQ5 (encoding the Klebsiella pneumoniae O1 LPS gene cluster), or pWQ802 (encoding the genes necessary for the synthesis of Salmonella enterica O:54). Both DeltatolA and delta pal mutants exhibited reduced surface expression of O16 LPS as compared to parental W3110, but no significant differences were observed in the expression of K. pneumoniae O1 LPS and S. enterica O:54 LPS. Therefore, TolA and Pal are required for the correct surface expression of O antigens that are assembled in a wzy (polymerase)-dependent manner (like those of E. coli O7 and O16) but not for O antigens assembled by wzy-independent pathways (like K. pneumoniae O1 and S. enterica O:54). Furthermore, we show that the reduced surface expression of O16 LPS in delta tolA and delta pal mutants was associated with a partial defect in O-antigen polymerization and it was corrected by complementation with intact tolA and pal genes, respectively. Using derivatives of W3110 delta tolA and W3110 delta pal containing lacZ reporter fusions to fkpA and degP, we also demonstrate that the RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress response is upregulated in these mutants. Moreover, an altered O16 polymerization was also detected under conditions that stimulate RpoE-mediated extracytoplasmic stress responses in tol+ and pal+ genetic backgrounds. A Wzy derivative with an epitope tag at the C-terminal end of the protein was stable in all the mutants, ruling out stress-mediated proteolysis of Wzy. We conclude that the absence of TolA and Pal elicits a sustained extracytoplasmic stress response that in turn reduces O-antigen polymerization but does not affect the stability of the Wzy O-antigen polymerase.
TI  - Physical linkage of Tn3 and part of Tn1721 in a tetracycline and ampicillin resistance plasmid from Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The complete nucleotide sequence of the 12 656 bp plasmid pFPTB1 from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, which mediates resistance to tetracyclines and ampicillin, was determined. The plasmid was analysed for potential reading frames and structural features indicative of transposons and transposon relics. METHODS: Plasmid pFPTB1 was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109, overlapping restriction fragments were cloned into E. coli plasmid vectors and sequenced. In vitro susceptibility testing was carried out to confirm the resistance phenotype mediated by this plasmid. RESULTS: Plasmid pFPTB1 contains a complete Tn3-like transposon of 4950 bp consisting of the left terminal repeat, Tn3-related tnpR and tnpA genes for transposition functions, a novel gene for ampicillin resistance bla(TEM-135), and the right terminal repeat. Immediately downstream, the terminal 5215 bp at the right end of a Tn1721-like transposon, including the right terminal repeat, a truncated transposase gene, as well as the genes tet(A) and tetR for tetracycline resistance, were detected. A 5 bp direct repeat, TAAAA, was seen immediately upstream of the Tn3 part and immediately downstream of the Tn1721 part. Plasmid pFPTB1 also carries a replication region similar to that of the Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pJHCMW1. CONCLUSION: Plasmid pFPTB1 is one of the few completely sequenced plasmids from S. Typhimurium and harbours a novel transposon-like structure consisting of a Tn3-related part containing the bla(TEM-135) gene for ampicillin resistance and a Tn1721-related part containing the tetR-tet(A) genes for tetracycline resistance.
TI  - Regulation of enteric endophytic bacterial colonization by plant defenses.
AB  - Bacterial endophytes reside within the interior of plants without causing disease or forming symbiotic structures. Some endophytes, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (Kp342), enhance plant growth and nutrition. Others, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), are human pathogens that contaminate raw produce. Several lines of evidence are presented here to support the hypothesis that plant defense response pathways regulate colonization by endophytic bacteria. An ethylene-insensitive mutant of Medicago truncatula is hypercolonized by Kp342 compared to the parent genotype. Addition of ethylene, a signal molecule for induced systemic resistance in plants, decreased endophytic colonization in Medicago spp. This ethylene-mediated inhibition of endophytic colonization was reversed by addition of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene. Colonization of Medicago spp. by S. typhimurium also was affected by exogenous ethylene. Mutants lacking flagella or a component of the type III secretion system of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (TTSS-SPI1) colonize the interior of Medicago spp. in higher numbers than the wild type. Arabidopsis defense response-related genotypes indicated that only salicylic acid (SA)-independent defense responses contribute to restricting colonization by Kp342. In contrast, colonization by S. typhimurium is affected by both SA-dependent and -independent responses. S. typhimurium mutants further delineated these responses, suggesting that both flagella and TTSS-SPI1 effectors can be recognized. Flagella act primarily through SA-independent responses (compromising SA accumulation still affected colonization in the absence of flagella). Removal of a TTSS-SPI1 effector resulted in hypercolonization regardless of whether the genotype was affected in either SA-dependent or SA-independent responses. Consistent with these results, S. typhimurium activates the promoter of PR1, a SA-dependent pathogenesis-related gene, while S. typhimurium mutants lacking the TTSS-SPI1 failed to activate this promoter. These observations suggest approaches to reduce contamination of raw produce by human enteric pathogens and to increase the number of growth-promoting bacteria in plants.
TI  - Serum amyloid A protein binds to outer membrane protein A of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid A (SAA) is the major acute phase protein in man and most mammals. We observed SAA binding to a surprisingly large number of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The binding was found to be high affinity and rapid. Importantly, this binding was not inhibited by high density lipoprotein with which SAA is normally complexed in serum. Binding was also observed when bacteria were offered serum containing SAA. Ligand blots following SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gels revealed two major ligands of 29 and 35 kDa that bound SAA when probing with radiolabeled SAA or SAA and monoclonal anti-SAA. Following fractionation the ligand was found in the outer membrane fraction of E. coli and was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be outer membrane protein A (OmpA). OmpA-deficient E. coli did not bind SAA, and following purification of OmpA the protein retained binding activity. The ligands on other bacteria were likely to be homologues of OmpA because wild type, but not OprF-deficient, P. aeruginosa bound SAA.
TI  - High rate of fatal cases of pediatric septicemia caused by gram-negative bacteria with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were present in high proportions of Escherichia coli (25% [9 of 36]) and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (17% [9 of 52]) causing pediatric septicemia at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. Patients with septicemia due to ESBL-producing organisms had a significantly higher fatality rate than those with non-ESBL isolates (71% versus 39%, P = 0.039). This is the first report of the CTX-M-15 genotype of ESBLs on the African continent and the first observation of SHV-12 genotype in an isolate of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  - We show here that transcription of the asr gene in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal induction at pH 4.0-4.5 as determined by Northern hybridization analysis. Previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the E. coli genome. Sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. By deletion of various segments of this region in the E. coli asr promoter it was shown that sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. Transcription from the E. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor RpoS (sigma(S)) in stationary phase. Transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein H-NS.
TI  - IdentiCS--identification of coding sequence and in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network directly from unannotated low-coverage bacterial genome sequence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A necessary step for a genome level analysis of the cellular metabolism is the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network from genome sequences. The available methods are mainly based on the annotation of genome sequences including two successive steps, the prediction of coding sequences (CDS) and their function assignment. The annotation process takes time. The available methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with unfinished error-containing genomic sequence. RESULTS: In this work a fast method is proposed to use unannotated genome sequence for predicting CDSs and for an in silico reconstruction of metabolic networks. Instead of using predicted genes or CDSs to query public databases, entries from public DNA or protein databases are used as queries to search a local database of the unannotated genome sequence to predict CDSs. Functions are assigned to the predicted CDSs simultaneously. The well-annotated genome of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 is used as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the method. 97.7% of the CDSs in the original annotation are correctly identified. The use of SWISS-PROT-TrEMBL databases resulted in an identification of 98.9% of CDSs that have EC-numbers in the published annotation. Furthermore, two versions of sequences of the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae with different genome coverage (3.9 and 7.9 fold, respectively) are examined. The results suggest that a 3.9-fold coverage of the bacterial genome could be sufficiently used for the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network. Compared to other gene finding methods such as CRITICA our method is more suitable for exploiting sequences of low genome coverage. Based on the new method, a program called IdentiCS (Identification of Coding Sequences from Unfinished Genome Sequences) is delivered that combines the identification of CDSs with the reconstruction, comparison and visualization of metabolic networks (free to download at http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/index.html). CONCLUSIONS: The reversed querying process and the program IdentiCS allow a fast and adequate prediction protein coding sequences and reconstruction of the potential metabolic network from low coverage genome sequences of bacteria. The new method can accelerate the use of genomic data for studying cellular metabolism.
TI  - Effect of triclosan or a phenolic farm disinfectant on the selection of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of growth of five strains of Salmonella enterica and their isogenic multiply antibiotic-resistant (MAR) derivatives with a phenolic farm disinfectant or triclosan (biocides) upon the frequency of mutation to resistance to antibiotics or cyclohexane. METHODS: Strains were grown in broth with or without the biocides and then spread on to agar containing ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or tetracycline each at 4x MIC or agar overlaid with cyclohexane. Incubation was for 24 and 48 h and the frequency of mutation to resistance was calculated for strains with and without prior growth with the biocides. MICs were determined and the presence of mutations in the acrR and marR regions was determined by sequencing and the presence of mutations in gyrA by light-cycler analysis, for a selection of the mutants that arose. RESULTS: The mean frequency of mutation to antibiotic or cyclohexane resistance was increased approximately 10- to 100-fold by prior growth with the phenolic disinfectant or triclosan. The increases were statistically significant for all antibiotics and cyclohexane following exposure to the phenolic disinfectant (P </= 0.013), and for ampicillin and cyclohexane following exposure to triclosan (P </= 0.009). Mutants inhibited by >1 mg/L ciprofloxacin arose only from strains that were MAR. Reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (at 4x MIC for parent strains) alone was associated with mutations in gyrA. MAR mutants did not contain mutations in the acrR or marR region. CONCLUSIONS: These data renew fears that the use of biocides may lead to an increased selective pressure towards antibiotic resistance.
TI  - The genes and enzymes for the catabolism of galactitol, D-tagatose, and related carbohydrates in Klebsiella oxytoca M5a1 and other enteric bacteria display convergent evolution.
AB  - Enteric bacteria (Enteriobacteriaceae) carry on their single chromosome about 4000 genes that all strains have in common (referred to here as "obligatory genes"), and up to 1300 "facultative" genes that vary from strain to strain and from species to species. In closely related species, obligatory and facultative genes are orthologous genes that are found at similar loci. We have analyzed a set of facultative genes involved in the degradation of the carbohydrates galactitol, D-tagatose, D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine in various pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of these bacteria. The four carbohydrates are transported into the cell by phosphotransferase (PTS) uptake systems, and are metabolized by closely related or even identical catabolic enzymes via pathways that share several intermediates. In about 60% of Escherichia coli strains the genes for galactitol degradation map to a gat operon at 46.8 min. In strains of Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, the corresponding gat genes, although orthologous to their E. coli counterparts, are found at 70.7 min, clustered in a regulon together with three tag genes for the degradation of D-tagatose, an isomer of D-fructose. In contrast, in all the E. coli strains tested, this chromosomal site was found to be occupied by an aga/kba gene cluster for the degradation of D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine. The aga/kba and the tag genes were paralogous either to the gat cluster or to the fru genes for degradation of D-fructose. Finally, in more then 90% of strains of both Klebsiella species, and in about 5% of the E. coli strains, two operons were found at 46.8 min that comprise paralogous genes for catabolism of the isomers D-arabinitol (genes atl or dal) and ribitol (genes rtl or rbt). In these strains gat genes were invariably absent from this location, and they were totally absent in S. enterica. These results strongly indicate that these various gene clusters and metabolic pathways have been subject to convergent evolution among the Enterobacteriaceae. This apparently involved recent horizontal gene transfer and recombination events, as indicated by major chromosomal rearrangements found in their immediate vicinity.
TI  - OmpR and LeuO positively regulate the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ompS2 porin gene.
AB  - The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ompS2 gene codes for a 362-amino-acid outer membrane protein that contains motifs common to the porin superfamily. It is expressed at very low levels compared to the major OmpC and OmpF porins, as observed for S. enterica serovar Typhi OmpS1, Escherichia coli OmpN, and Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpK37 quiescent porins. A region of 316 bp, between nucleotides -413 and -97 upstream of the transcriptional start point, is involved in negative regulation, as its removal resulted in a 10-fold increase in ompS2 expression in an S. enterica serovar Typhi wild-type strain. This enhancement in expression was not observed in isogenic mutant strains, which had specific deletions of the regulatory ompB (ompR envZ) operon. Furthermore, ompS2 expression was substantially reduced in the presence of the OmpR D55A mutant, altered in the major phosphorylation site. Upon random mutagenesis, a mutant where the transposon had inserted into the upstream regulatory region of the gene coding for the LeuO regulator, showed an increased level of ompS2 expression. Augmented expression of ompS2 was also obtained upon addition of cloned leuO to the wild-type strain, but not in an ompR isogenic derivative, consistent with the notion that the transposon insertion had increased the cellular levels of LeuO and with the observed dependence on OmpR. Moreover, LeuO and OmpR bound in close proximity, but independently, to the 5' upstream regulatory region. Thus, the OmpR and LeuO regulators positively regulate ompS2.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Highly divergent RfaH orthologs from pathogenic proteobacteria can substitute for Escherichia coli RfaH both in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The transcriptional enhancer protein RfaH positively regulates production of virulence factors in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium via a cis element, ops. Genes coding for RfaH orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including Vibrio and Yersinia spp. We cloned the rfaH genes from Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae into E. coli expression vectors. Purified RfaH orthologs, including the most divergent one from V. cholerae, were readily recruited to the E. coli transcription elongation complex. Postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to E. coli RfaH. V. cholerae RfaH was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. When overexpressed episomally, all of the rfaH genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the E. coli gene. Thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the RfaH proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the E. coli system.
TI  - Genetic and structural characterization of the core region of the lipopolysaccharide from Serratia marcescens N28b (serovar O4).
AB  - The gene cluster (waa) involved in Serratia marcescens N28b core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis was identified, cloned, and sequenced. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae led to the identification of five genes coding for products involved in the biosynthesis of a shared inner core structure: [L,D-HeppIIIalpha(1-->7)-L,D-HeppIIalpha(1-->3)-L,D-HeppIalpha(1-->5)-KdopI(4<--2 )alphaKdopII] (L,D-Hepp, L-glycero-D-manno-heptopyranose; Kdo, 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid). Complementation and/or chemical analysis of several nonpolar mutants within the S. marcescens waa gene cluster suggested that in addition, three waa genes were shared by S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae, indicating that the core region of the LPS of S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae possesses additional common features. Chemical and structural analysis of the major oligosaccharide from the core region of LPS of an O-antigen-deficient mutant of S. marcescens N28b as well as complementation analysis led to the following proposed structure: beta-Glc-(1-->6)-alpha-Glc-(1-->4))-alpha-D-GlcN-(1-->4)-alpha-D-GalA-[(2<--1)-al pha-D,D-Hep-(2<--1)-alpha-Hep]-(1-->3)-alpha-L,D-Hep[(7<--1)-alpha-L,D-Hep]-(1--> 3)-alpha-L,D-Hep-[(4<--1)-beta-D-Glc]-(1-->5)-Kdo. The D configuration of the beta-Glc, alpha-GclN, and alpha-GalA residues was deduced from genetic data and thus is tentative. Furthermore, other oligosaccharides were identified by ion cyclotron resonance-Fourier-transformed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which presumably contained in addition one residue of D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Ko) or of a hexuronic acid. Several ions were identified that differed from others by a mass of +80 Da, suggesting a nonstoichiometric substitution by a monophosphate residue. However, none of these molecular species could be isolated in substantial amounts and structurally analyzed. On the basis of the structure shown above and the analysis of nonpolar mutants, functions are suggested for the genes involved in core biosynthesis.
TI  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium RamA, intracellular oxidative stress response, and bacterial virulence.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium have evolved genetic systems, such as the soxR/S and marA regulons, to detoxify reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, which are formed as by-products of metabolism. Superoxide also serves as a microbicidal effector mechanism of the host's phagocytes. Here, we investigate whether regulatory genes other than soxR/S and marA are active in response to oxidative stress in Salmonella and may function as virulence determinants. We identified a bacterial gene, which was designated ramA (342 bp) and mapped at 13.1 min on the Salmonella chromosome, that, when overexpressed on a plasmid in E. coli or Salmonella, confers a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by increased resistance to the redox-cycling agent menadione and to multiple unrelated antibiotics. The ramA gene is present in Salmonella serovars but is absent in E. coli. The gene product displays 37 to 52% homology to the transcriptional activators soxR/S and marA and 80 to 100% identity to a multidrug resistance gene in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A. Although a ramA soxR/S double null mutant is highly susceptible to intracellular superoxide generated by menadione and displays decreased Mn-superoxide dismutase activity, intracellular survival of this mutant within macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells and in vivo replication in the spleens in Ityr mice are not affected. We concluded that despite its role in the protective response of the bacteria to oxidative stress in vitro, the newly identified ramA gene, together with soxR/S, does not play a role in initial replication of Salmonella in the organs of mice.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - In vitro activities of native and designed peptide antibiotics against drug sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines.
AB  - In order to develop peptide agents with reduced length and enhanced tumoricidal activity, we have designed gaegurin 6 (GGN6) derivatives through deletions and/or substitutions of amino acids. The deletion of hydrophobic amino terminal region completely abolished antitumor activity whereas the deletion of carboxy terminal region had little influence on antitumor activity. Antitumor activity of the PTP peptides did not correlate with antibacterial activity. PTP7, the most potent derivative, was found to have comparable antitumor activity to GGN6 in spite of reduced number of amino acids which is about half the size of gaegurin 6; furthermore, it showed little cytotoxicity on PBMCs and RBCs. GGN6 and PTP7 also showed equivalent cytotoxicity against drug sensitive (MCF-7) and multidrug-resistant cell lines (MCF-7/DOX). Plasma membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation of peptide-treated tumor cells indicated that the peptides could induce apoptosis in tumor cells. These results suggest that GGN6 and its derivatives can be developed as new anticancer agents and may provide a new strategy for overcoming MDR which is a major problem in cancer therapy.
TI  - Duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. Here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. Using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. RESULTS: It is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. Furthermore, the GC3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. The importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. Therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.
TI  - Florfenicol resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Newport mediated by a plasmid related to R55 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Florfenicol resistance has emerged over the past few years in multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Agona and Paratyphi B. The floR gene encoding florfenicol resistance is chromosomally located in these serovars within a genomic island of 43 kb called SGI1 (Salmonella genomic island 1). In the present study, we characterized florfenicol resistance in a strain of S. enterica serovar Newport isolated from a turkey in 1990 and that lacked SGI1. Florfenicol resistance was mediated by a conjugative plasmid related to R55 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was characterized initially in the 1970s and harbours a gene 95% identical to floR.
TI  - Imipenem resistance in a Salmonella clinical strain due to plasmid-mediated class A carbapenemase KPC-2.
AB  - A Salmonella enterica serotype Cubana isolate exhibiting resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including oxyimino-cephalosporins and imipenem, was isolated from a 4-year-old boy with gastroenteritis in Maryland. beta-Lactam resistance was mediated by a conjugative plasmid that encoded KPC-2, a class A carbapenemase previously found in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the Maryland area as well. Sequence analysis of the flanking regions indicated a potential association of bla(KPC-2) with mobile structures.
TI  - Emergence of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella isolates and rapid spread of plasmid-encoded CMY-2-like cephalosporinase, Taiwan.
AB  - Of 384 Salmonella isolates collected from 1997 to 2000 in a university hospital in Taiwan, six ceftriaxone-resistant isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were found in two patients in 2000. The resistance determinants were on conjugative plasmids that encoded a CMY-2-like cephalosporinase. During the study period, the proportion of CMY-2-like enzyme producers among Escherichia coli increased rapidly from 0.2% in early 1999 to >4.0% in late 2000. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing a CMY-2-like beta-lactamase did not emerge until 2000. The presence of bla(CMY)-containing plasmids with an identical restriction pattern from Salmonella, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae isolates was found, which suggests interspecies spread and horizontal transfer of the resistance determinant. Various nosocomial and community-acquired infections were associated with the CMY-2-like enzyme producers. Our study suggests that the spread of plasmid-mediated CMY-2-like beta-lactamases is an emerging threat to hospitalized patients and the public in Taiwan.
TI  - Kinetics and strain specificity of rhizosphere and endophytic colonization by enteric bacteria on seedlings of Medicago sativa and Medicago truncatula.
AB  - The presence of human-pathogenic, enteric bacteria on the surface and in the interior of raw produce is a significant health concern. Several aspects of the biology of the interaction between these bacteria and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) seedlings are addressed here. A collection of enteric bacteria associated with alfalfa sprout contaminations, along with Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028, and an endophyte of maize, Klebsiella pneumoniae 342, were labeled with green fluorescent protein, and their abilities to colonize the rhizosphere and the interior of the plant were compared. These strains differed widely in their endophytic colonization abilities, with K. pneumoniae 342 and E. coli K-12 being the best and worst colonizers, respectively. The abilities of the pathogens were between those of K. pneumoniae 342 and E. coli K-12. All Salmonella bacteria colonized the interiors of the seedlings in high numbers with an inoculum of 10(2) CFU, although infection characteristics were different for each strain. For most strains, a strong correlation between endophytic colonization and rhizosphere colonization was observed. These results show significant strain specificity for plant entry by these strains. Significant colonization of lateral root cracks was observed, suggesting that this may be the site of entry into the plant for these bacteria. At low inoculum levels, a symbiosis mutant of Medicago truncatula, dmi1, was colonized in higher numbers on the rhizosphere and in the interior by a Salmonella endophyte than was the wild-type host. Endophytic entry of M. truncatula appears to occur by a mechanism independent of the symbiotic infections by Sinorhizobium meliloti or mycorrhizal fungi.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from different bacterial sources elicit disparate cytokine responses in whole blood assays.
AB  - The stimulatory effects of different purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations from E. coli, S. typhosa, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae on cytokine and chemokine production were measured in whole blood assays by ELISA. Incubation of 0.5 ml whole blood with 10 ng/ml E. coli and S. typhosa resulted in a time-dependent production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and MCP-1. K. pneumoniae, however, showed preferential effects on IL-1beta, IL-10 and MCP-1 production with less potent effects on TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. LPS derived from P. aeruginosa showed a similar potency to other LPS preparations on MCP-1 production, yet completely failed to elicit the production of other cytokines. To further investigate potencies of the different LPS preparations, mediator production was determined following stimulation with agonist concentrations of 0.1 ng and 1000 ng per ml over a 24 h time period. Dose-response curves were obtained with LPS derived from E. coli, S. typhosa and K. pneumoniae on all mediators apart from IL-1beta and MCP-1. Most strikingly though, was the ability of LPS derived from P. aeruginosa to selectively elicit a significant dose-response effect on MCP-1 production, despite its very weak stimulatory effects on all other cytokines. These data imply that the bacterial origin of different LPS preparations can exhibit disparate effects on inflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, the potent, selective dose-response effect of P. aeruginosa LPS on MCP-1 production could help to explain the preponderance of a relentless inflammatory cellular infiltrate in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF).
TI  - Characterization of serracin P, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, and its activity against Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - Serratia plymithicum J7 culture supernatant displayed activity against many pathogenic strains of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the most serious bacterial disease of apple and pear trees, fire blight, and against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This activity increased significantly upon induction with mitomycin C. A phage-tail-like bacteriocin, named serracin P, was purified from an induced culture supernatant of S. plymithicum J7. It was found to be the only compound involved in the antibacterial activity against sensitive strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the two major subunits (23 and 43 kDa) of serracin P revealed high homology with the Fels-2 prophage of Salmonella enterica, the coliphages P2 and 168, the phiCTX prophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a prophage of Yersinia pestis. This strongly suggests a common ancestry for serracin P and these bacteriophages.
TI  - The avian chorioallantoic membrane in ovo--a useful model for bacterial invasion  assays.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the practicability of the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) with special regard to the 'natural air sac' technique (NAST) of preparation for in-vivo research on the invasive potential of bacterial strains of various enterobacterial species. It was sought to establish an experimental system more closely resembling in-vivo conditions than cell lines on one hand, and cheaper and easier to handle than established animal models on the other. Fertilized eggs of the domestic fowl were incubated. The CAM was prepared atraumatically at the natural air space of the egg, and a cannula was inserted for subsequent extraction of allantoic fluid (AF) below the CAM. The CAM was then inoculated with either one out of five strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, an Escherichia coli K-12 strain or a Salmonella typhimurium strain, either alone or in combinations, respectively. AF samples were extracted at certain time points, and the presence of bacteria was determined by cultivation. Penetration and mortality ratios of the infected embryos were calculated. In addition, the mode of crossing the epithelial barrier was examined by electron microscopy. Differing rates of invasion through the CAM and rates of mortality of the chicken embryos demonstrated a clear dependency on the inoculated bacterial strain. Low invading bacteria could be distinguished from intermediate strains, and from strains exerting a strong capability of invasion and killing of the embryos. Simultaneous monotopical inoculation of Klebsiella and E. coli showed a permissive effect of co-incubated Klebsiella on the invasiveness of E. coli. The chick embryo CAM prepared by NAST has shown to be a useful model for in vivo studies on invasion capabilities, pathogenicity and interactions of inoculated bacteria.
TI  - Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing inducible DHA-1 beta-lactamase in a university hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - Ten nonrepetitive clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibiting an unusual inducible beta-lactam resistance phenotype were identified between January 1999 and September 2001 in a university hospital in Taiwan. In the presence of 2 micro g of clavulanic acid, the isolates showed a one to four twofold concentration increase in the MICs of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefepime (MICs, </=0.5 micro g/ml) and imipenem (MICs, </=0.5 micro g/ml). PCR, sequence analysis, and isoelectric focusing revealed production by these isolates of TEM-1, SHV-11, and DHA-1, a plasmid-encoded inducible AmpC beta-lactamase originally found in a Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis strain. Transfer of the resistance by conjugation experiments was not successful, but Southern hybridization showed that bla(DHA-1) was located on 70-kb plasmids, suggesting that the bla(DHA-1)-containing plasmids in the K. pneumoniae isolates were non-self-transmissible. Five isolates were recovered from patients in two surgery wards and two intensive care units. Acquisition of the DHA-1 producers could be traced back to previous hospitalizations 1 to 5 months earlier for the other five patients. Six and seven patterns among the isolates were demonstrated by plasmid analysis and ribotyping, respectively, indicating that the spread of the DHA-1 producers was due to both horizontal transfer of bla(DHA-1) and dissemination of endemic clones.
TI  - Fe(III)-mediated cellular toxicity.
AB  - Because it can undergo reversible changes in oxidation state, iron is an excellent biocatalyst but also a potentially deleterious metal. Iron-mediated toxicity has been ascribed to Fe(II), which reacts with oxygen to generate free radicals that damage macromolecules and cause cell death. However, we now report that Fe(III) exhibits microbicidal activity towards strains of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae defective in the Fe(III)-responding PmrA/PmrB signal transduction system. Fe(III) bound to a pmrA Salmonella mutant more effectively than to the isogenic wild-type strain and exerted its microbicidal activity even under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, Fe(III) permeabilized the outer membrane of the pmrA mutant, rendering it susceptible to vancomycin, which is normally non-toxic to Gram-negative species. On the other hand, Fe(III) did not affect the viability of a mutant defective in Fur, the major regulator of cytosolic iron homeostasis, which is hypersensitive to Fe(II)-mediated toxicity. A functional pmrA gene was necessary for bacterial survival in soil. Our results indicate that Fe(III) exerts its microbicidal activity by a mechanism that is oxygen independent and different from that mediated by Fe(II).
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex PCR.
AB  - Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.
TI  - Characterisation of the diol dehydratase pdu operon of Lactobacillus collinoides.
AB  - The three genes (pduCDE) encoding the diol dehydratase of Lactobacillus collinoides were sequenced. They exhibited strong identities with the ddrABC and pduCDE genes of Klebsiella oxytoca and Salmonella enterica, respectively. These genes are part of a putative operon with at least four other genes. An eighth open reading frame was identified as homologous to the pocR gene (encoding the operon regulatory protein). Although the enzyme was detected in exponential growth phase, PduCDE activity was increased at the end of exponential phase in presence of 1,2-propanediol.
TI  - Two class II D-tagatose-bisphosphate aldolases from enteric bacteria.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniaeand Klebsiella oxytocawere found to contain two D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate (TagBP)-specific aldolases involved in catabolism of galactitol (genes gatY gatZ) and of N-acetyl-galactosamine and D-galactosamine (genes kbaY kbaZ,also called agaY agaZ). The two aldolases were closely related (> or = 53.8% identical amino acids) and could substitute for each other in vivo. The catalytic subunits GatY or KbaY alone were sufficient to show aldolase activity. Although substantially shorter than other aldolases (285 amino acids, instead of 358 and 349 amino acids), these subunits contained most or all of the residues that have been identified as essential in substrate/product recognition and catalysis for class II aldolases. In contrast to these, both aldolases required subunits GatZ or KbaZ (420 amino acids) for full activity and for good in vivo and in vitro stability. The Z subunits alone did not show any aldolase activity. Close relatives of these new TagBP aldolases were found in several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Streptomyces coelicolor.
TI  - [Identification of plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1 among various enterobacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella) isolated from a Tunisian hospital (Sfax 997-2000)].
AB  - Because a multiresistant K. pneumoniae outbreak detected in an intensive care unit of a parisian hospital, combined to the production of the plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1, a probable importation via a patient was suggested from another country (Tunisia). The investigation was conducted to examine 35 clinical strains of enterobacteria resistant to ceftazidime without synergy towards Augmentin. Other test of synergy with two inhibitors, BRL 42715, Ro 48-5545 was performed by diffusion method and deposit of 10 micrograms of inhibitor on disks containing ceftazidime, cefoxitin and cefotetan. Synergies were obtained suggesting a probable production of ACC-1 type among six isolates of K. pneumoniae (two), Proteus mirabilis (one) and Salmonella (three) issued from different units. The isoelectric focusing on gel revealed at least one band of beta-lactamase activity at 7.8 but also demonstrated the simultaneous production of several probable beta-lactamases including TEM-type, SHV-2 and ACC-1 among S. enterica ser. Livingstone. The PCR of the gene blaacc-1 was positive. The sequencing (1160 pb) of two products showed high identity (99-100%) with the gene blaacc-1 deposited in 1999. Finally the ACC-1 type reported in Tunisia was probably imported in France via a patient. Because a simultaneous synthesis of ESBL and ACC-1 type, its presence may be invisible and need more investigation.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.
AB  - Salmonella enterica subspecies I, serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis, and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. The incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year. Here we sequenced the 4,857-kilobase (kb) chromosome and 94-kb virulence plasmid of S. typhimurium strain LT2. The distribution of close homologues of S. typhimurium LT2 genes in eight related enterobacteria was determined using previously completed genomes of three related bacteria, sample sequencing of both S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. paratyphi A) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and hybridization of three unsequenced genomes to a microarray of S. typhimurium LT2 genes. Lateral transfer of genes is frequent, with 11% of the S. typhimurium LT2 genes missing from S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi), and 29% missing from Escherichia coli K12. The 352 gene homologues of S. typhimurium LT2 confined to subspecies I of S. enterica-containing most mammalian and bird pathogens-are useful for studies of epidemiology, host specificity and pathogenesis. Most of these homologues were previously unknown, and 50 may be exported to the periplasm or outer membrane, rendering them accessible as therapeutic or vaccine targets.
TI  - Bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (ACM) with a wide range of disease severity. DESIGN: Cohort study. ANIMALS: 144 dairy cows with ACM from 6 herds. PROCEDURE: Cows were examined at time of identification of ACM (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. Cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. Bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), CBC, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. Appropriate samples were obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. Blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an ACM episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). Group-1 isolates (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with ACM and 0 of 156 control cows. Group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ACM, respectively. Escherichia coli and K pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of the same genotype. Bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). Thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with ACM. Classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with ACM.
TI  - Families of restriction enzymes: an analysis prompted by molecular and genetic data for type ID restriction and modification systems.
AB  - Current genetic and molecular evidence places all the known type I restriction and modification systems of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica into one of four discrete families: type IA, IB, IC or ID. StySBLI is the founder member of the ID family. Similarities of coding sequences have identified restriction systems in E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae as probable members of the type ID family. We present complementation tests that confirm the allocation of EcoR9I and KpnAI to the ID family. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of the HsdS subunits of StySBLI and EcoR9I identify two variable regions, each predicted to be a target recognition domain (TRD). Consistent with two TRDs, StySBLI was shown to recognise a bipartite target sequence, but one in which the adenine residues that are the substrates for methylation are separated by only 6 bp. Implications of family relationships are discussed and evidence is presented that extends the family affiliations identified in enteric bacteria to a wide range of other genera.
TI  - Lethal Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium endotoxemia is mediated through different pathways.
AB  - Despite the differences in the molecular structure between lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Salmonella typhimurium, the potential differences in their biological effects in vivo have not been investigated. In the present study, TNF and LT double knock-out (TNF-/-LT-/-) mice were almost as susceptible as TNF+/+LT+/+ controls to S. typhimurium LPS, but they were significantly more resistant to lethal endotoxemia induced by E. coli or K. pneumoniae LPS. The effect was not due to endotoxin-associated proteins. In the knock-out mice, this difference in lethality was accompanied by decreased interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production after challenge with E. coli LPS, whereas after S. typhimurium LPS more IL-1 and IFN-gamma were produced. In contrast, more IL-10 was produced after challenge of mice with E. coli LPS than with S. typhimurium LPS. The hypothesis that a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the mortality after S. typhimurium LPS was suggested by experiments in mice deficient in IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE-/- mice). ICE-/-mice, lacking mature IL-1beta and IL-18, but also defective in IFN-gamma and TNF production, were completely protected against both E. coli and S. typhimurium LPS. Experiments in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 defective mice suggested that the difference is not due to differential activation of TLR4. In conclusion, TNF and LT play a central role in the lethality due to E. coli LPS, whereas the lethal effects of S. typhimurium LPS are mediated through mechanisms also involving other cytokines such as IFN-gamma, IL-1 and IL-18.
TI  - CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains isolated in Spain (October 1999-December 2000).
AB  - CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and functional analysis of three glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the inner core region of Klebsiella pneumoniae lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The genes encoding the 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferase (waaA) and heptosyltransferases I (waaC) and II (waaF) in Klebsiella pneumoniae were cloned from a DNA library by functional complementation of corresponding Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica mutants. Sequence analyses revealed extensive homologies of the deduced proteins to their counterparts in other Enterobacteriaceae. However, differences were evident with regard to the chromosomal organization of the genes. To perform in vitro studies, the waaA, waaC and waaF genes were subcloned and expressed in the Gram-positive host Corynebacterium glutamicum. WaaA was characterized as a bifunctional enzyme capable of transferring two Kdo residues to a synthetic bisphosphorylated tetraacyl-lipid A precursor of E. coli (compound 406). In contrast, waaC and waaF were shown to encode specific glycosyltransferases catalyzing the consecutive transfer of two L-glycero-D-manno-heptose residues to Kdo(2)-406.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance mediated by IncC plasmid R55 is encoded by a floR gene variant.
AB  - The IncC plasmid R55, initially described in the 1970s and isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae, confers nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance. The gene coding for this resistance was cloned and sequenced and shows 95 to 97% nucleotide identity with the recently reported floR gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 and from Escherichia coli animal isolates, respectively, conferring cross-resistance to florfenicol.
TI  - Transposition of IS1397 in the family Enterobacteriaceae and first characterization of ISKpn1, a new insertion sequence associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae palindromic units.
AB  - IS1397 and ISKpn1 are IS3 family members which are specifically inserted into the loop of palindromic units (PUs). IS1397 is shown to transpose into PUs with sequences close or identical to the Escherichia coli consensus, even in other enterobacteria (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca). Moreover, we show that homologous intergenic regions containing PUs constitute IS1397 transpositional hot spots, despite bacterial interspersed mosaic element structures that differ among the three species. ISKpn1, described here for the first time, is specific for PUs from K. pneumoniae, in which we discovered it. A sequence comparison between the two insertion sequences allowed us to define a motif possibly accounting for their specificity.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in Klebsiella pneumoniae C3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. The recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coaD genes, as was found in E. coli K-12. PCR amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative K. pneumoniae strains. Partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from E. coli K-12 and/or Salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. Analysis of a constructed K. pneumoniae waaE deletion mutant suggests that the WaaE protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-D-Glc to the O-4 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose I, a feature shared by K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Comparative approach to analysis of regulation in complete genomes: multidrug resistance systems in gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  - Comparative approach is a powerful tool for analysis of gene regulation in bacterial genomes. Here we apply it to analysis of regulation of the multidrug resistance transport (MDRT) systems in enterobacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia pestis. Comparison of nucleotide sequences upstream of MDRT genes was performed in order to predict new regulatory sites (operators) and identify candidate regulons. Since the regulatory sites diverge slower than the non-coding regions in general, they are visible as strongly conserved islands. This analysis resulted in description of a regulatory network for known and hypothetical MDRT systems and porins. New candidate members of the MarA regulon were detected. Putative binding sites for EmrR and AcrR were suggested. A new hypothetical MarX regulon was described that includes some multidrug transporters and porins.
TI  - Identification of a non-haem catalase in Salmonella and its regulation by RpoS (sigmaS).
AB  - We report the identification and functional analysis of katN, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. katN, which is not present in Escherichia coli, is located between the yciGFE and yciD E. coli homologues in the Salmonella genome. Its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 Da and is similar to the Mn-catalases of Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermus spp. Its product, KatN, was visualized as a 37 kDa protein in E. coli maxicells. A KatN recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its C-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. KatN was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. Its expression was shown to be regulated by growth phase and rpoS. Northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream yciGFE genes. A putative rpoS-regulated promoter was identified upstream of yciG. Southern blotting revealed that katN is conserved within Salmonella serovars. katN homologues were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A katN mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) response of Salmonella. However, the expression of katN increased the H2O2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpoS mutants in stationary phase. Thus, KatN may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in Salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
TI  - Molecular characterization of global regulatory RNA species that control pathogenicity factors in Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - rsmB(Ecc) specifies a nontranslatable RNA regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect of rsmB(Ecc) RNA is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of RsmA(Ecc), an RNA-binding protein of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. To determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmB(Ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing Erwinia species, we cloned the rsmB genes of E. amylovora (rsmB(Ea)) and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmB(Ehg)). We show that rsmB(Ea) in E. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, motility, and pathogenicity. In E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmB(Ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of EPS and yellow pigment as well as motility. RsmA(Ea) and RsmA(Ehg) have more than 93% identity to RsmA(Ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. The rsmB genes reverse the negative effects of RsmA(Ea), RsmA(Ehg), and RsmA(Ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. These observations and findings that rsmB(Ea) and rsmB(Ehg) RNA bind RsmA(Ecc) indicate that the rsmB effect is channeled via RsmA. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmB genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a RsmA(+) strain of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its RsmA(-) derivative. E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmB transcript that is not subject to processing. By contrast, E. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmB transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmB(Ecc). Southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmB homologs in E. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. amylovora, E. herbicola, E. stewartii and E. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. A comparison of rsmB sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmB RNA.
TI  - Conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoH of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The rpoH regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from GenBank and compared. In addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH of Yersinia frederiksenii and Proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. Sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters P1, P4 and P5, to the sigma(E) promoter P3 and to boxes DnaA1, DnaA2, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) boxes CRP1, CRP2 and box CytR present in Escherichia coli K12, were identified in sequences of closely related bacteria such as: E.coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In more distant bacteria, Y.frederiksenii and P.mirabilis, the rpoH regulatory region has a distal P1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. Sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria. This study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoH gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. A second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to E.coli.
TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Web-based visualization tools for bacterial genome alignments.
AB  - With the increase in the flow of sequence data, both in contigs and whole genomes, visual aids for comparison and analysis studies are becoming imperative. We describe three web-based tools for visualizing alignments of bacterial genomes. The first, called Enteric, produces a graphical, hypertext view of pairwise alignments between a reference genome and sequences from each of several related organisms, covering 20 kb around a user-specified position. Insertions, deletions and rearrangements relative to the reference genome are color-coded, which reveals many intriguing differences among genomes. The second, Menteric, computes and displays nucleotide-level multiple alignments of the same sequences, together with annotations of ORFs and regulatory sites, in a 1 kb region surrounding a given address. The third, a Java-based viewer called Maj, combines some features of the previous tools, and adds a zoom-in mechanism. We compare the Escherichia coli K-12 genome with the partially sequenced genomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholerae, and the Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi A. Examination of the pairwise and multiple alignments in a region allows one to draw inferences about regulatory patterns and functional assignments. For example, these tools revealed that rffH, a gene involved in enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis, is partly deleted in one of the genomes. We used PCR to show that this deletion occurs sporadically in some strains of some serovars of S.enterica subspecies I but not in any strains tested from six other subspecies. The resulting cell surface diversity may be associated with selection by the host immune response.
TI  - A trans-acting RNA as a control switch in Escherichia coli: DsrA modulates function by forming alternative structures.
AB  - DsrA is an 87-nucleotide regulatory RNA of Escherichia coli that acts in trans by RNA-RNA interactions with two different mRNAs, hns and rpoS. DsrA has opposite effects on these transcriptional regulators. H-NS levels decrease, whereas RpoS (final sigma(s)) levels increase. Here we show that DsrA enhances hns mRNA turnover yet stabilizes rpoS mRNA, either directly or via effects on translation. Computational and RNA footprinting approaches led to a refined structure for DsrA, and a model in which DsrA interacts with the hns mRNA start and stop codon regions to form a coaxial stack. Analogous bipartite interactions exist in eukaryotes, albeit with different regulatory consequences. In contrast, DsrA base pairs in discrete fashion with the rpoS RNA translational operator. Thus, different structural configurations for DsrA lead to opposite regulatory consequences for target RNAs.
TI  - Hadrurin, a new antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the scorpion Hadrurus aztecus.
AB  - A new antimicrobial peptide, hadrurin, was isolated from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Hadrurus aztecus, by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column, followed by high performance liquid chromatography. It is a basic peptide composed of 41 amino-acid residues with a molecular mass of 4436 Da, and contains no cysteines. A model of the three-dimensional folding of hadrurin is compatible with that of an amphipatic molecule with two alpha-helical segments. Hadrurin demonstrates antimicrobial activity at low micromolar concentration, inhibiting the growth of bacteria such as: Salmonella thyphi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Serratia marscences. It also shows cytolytic activity when tested in human erythrocytes. Hadrurin and two analogs (C-terminal amidated, and all D-enantiomer) were chemically synthesized. They were used to study the possible molecular mechanism of action by testing their ability to dissipate the diffusion potential of liposomes of different compositions. The results obtained indicate that there are no specific receptor molecules for the action of hadrurin, and the most probable mechanism is through a membrane destabilization activity. It is surmised that hadrurin is used by the scorpion as both an attack and defense element against its prey and putative invasive microorganisms. It is a unique peptide among all known antimicrobial peptides described, only partially similar to the N-terminal segment of gaegurin 4 and brevinin 2e, isolated from frog skin. It would certainly be a model molecule for studying new antibiotic activities and peptide-lipid interactions.
TI  - [Typing of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Salmonella typhimurium strains isolated in a pediatric unit].
AB  - Extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) derive mainly from TEM and SHV b-lactamases. These enzymes confer resistance to all oxyimino cephalosporins and monobactams except cephamycins and carbapems. ESBLs are often encoded by large plasmids that carry resistance determinants to multiple antibiotics and spread among the members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Since the first outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase reported in 1984, nosocomial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae species which produce ESBLs have been generally recovered from patients hospitalized in intensive care units. The most frequently isolated ESBL-producing strains belong to the genus Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterobacter and Proteus; ESBLs are rarely associated with the genus Salmonella. The first Salmonella were detected in France in 1984 (Salmonella typhimurium), in Tunisia in 1988 (Salmonella wien) and in Argentina in 1991 (Salmonella typhimurium). In 1994, 10 isolates of Salmonella typhimurium expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were isolated for the first time from 10 children hospitalized in a pediatric unit of the hospital Ibn-Rochd, Casablanca. Previous study showed that all isolates belonged the same serotype, and biotype, and showed a resistance to oxyimino beta-lactams, gentamycin, tobramycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but remained susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and quinolones. Oxyimino beta-lactams resistance determinant of all strains of Salmonella typhimurium was transferred by conjugation to Escherichia coli; Resistance to gentamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also cotransferred. In this study, we characterized the relationship between all isolates by comparing plasmid profiles and patterns of proteins because there appear to be the more effective method for evaluating epidemiologic relationship between Salmonella species, and the protein profiles method has been used for many bacterial species. These two methods have the advantages of speed and simplicity. All isolates presented the same plasmid pattern characterised by three plasmids and the same pattern of proteins composed of 36 bands. We concluded by combining results that this outbreak involved the spread of the same strain of Salmonella typhimurium between the ten children. As this type of resistance is easily transferred by these isolates to other bacterial species, the major risk would be its transfer to Salmonella typhi.
TI  - Evaluation of the Petrifilm rapid coliform count plate method for coliform enumeration from surimi-based imitation crab slurry.
AB  - The 3M Petrifilm rapid coliform count (RCC) plate method was compared with two conventional methods, namely violet red bile agar (VRBA) and desoxycholate lactose agar (DLA), for enumerating coliforms. The VRBA plating method is a reference method in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual and the DLA plating method is the method recommended by the Food Sanitation Law of Korea for enumeration of coliforms. Serratia sp., a coliform that was isolated from frozen surimi, was incubated in surimi-based imitation crab (SBIC) slurries and enumerated on the Petrifilm RCC, VRBA, and DLA plates. Results from the Petrifilm RCC plate were not significantly different from results from VRBA or DLA plates at P < 0.05 level. The correlation coefficient for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the VRBA method and for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the DLA method were 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. With the Petrifilm RCC plate method, we were able to estimate presumptive coliforms (except Serratia sp.) after 14 h and to enumerate confirmed coliforms (including Serratia sp.) after 24 h.
TI  - Comparison of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome with sampled genomes of a Klebsiella pneumoniae and three salmonella enterica serovars, Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi.
AB  - The Escherichia coli K-12 genome (ECO) was compared with the sampled genomes of the sibling species Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi A (collectively referred to as SAL) and the genome of the close outgroup Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN). There are at least 160 locations where sequences of >400 bp are absent from ECO but present in the genomes of all three SAL and 394 locations where sequences are present in ECO but close homologs are absent in all SAL genomes. The 394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL contain 1350 (30.6%) of the 4405 ECO genes. Of these, 1165 are missing from both SAL and KPN. Most of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of such genes. Among these regions were six that included previously identified cryptic phage. A hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that differ between ECO and SAL can be inferred in some cases by reference to the genome structure in KPN and the more distant relative Yersinia pestis. However, many changes between ECO and SAL are concentrated in regions where all four genera have a different structure. The rate of gene insertion and deletion is sufficiently high in these regions that the ancestral state of the ECO/SAL lineage cannot be inferred from the present data. The sequencing of other closely related genomes, such as S.bongori or Citrobacter, may help in this regard.
TI  - Inorganic polyphosphate is required for motility of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The ppk gene encodes polyphosphate kinase (PPK), the principal enzyme in many bacteria responsible for the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) from ATP. A null mutation in the ppk gene of six bacterial pathogens renders them greatly impaired in motility on semisolid agar plates; this defect can be corrected by the introduction of ppk gene in trans. In view of the fact that the motility of pathogens is essential to invade and establish systemic infections in host cells, this impairment in motility suggests a crucial and essential role of PPK or polyP in bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Identification of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria by direct matrix-assisted laser desorptiom/ionization mass spectrometric analysis of whole cells.
AB  - Several members of Enterobacteriaceas were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Characteristic mass spectral peaks and patterns were observed in the mass range of 2 to 20 kDa. The mass peaks reported to be reproducibly observed by previous researchers, which were claimed to serve as species/strain-specific biomarkers, are consistently observed in our current study. Despite the high degree of similarity found in the MALDI mass spectra within the enteric bacteria, minor yet notable differences existed to allow their differentiation. Five spectral peaks at m/z 4364, 5380, 6384, 6856, and 9540, generated reproducibly for each genus studied here, are assigned as family-specific biomarkers for the Family Enterobacteriaceae. The mass peaks at m/z 7324, 7724, 9136, and 9253 are assigned as genus-specific biomarkers for Salmonella. Some unique biomarkers characterizing the species and strains of E. coli are also presented.
TI  - Oral administration of lipopolysaccharide exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis  in mice.
AB  - We investigated whether oral administration of LPS exacerbated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, which was an experimental model of autoimmune disease. CIA was induced by s.c. injection of type II collagen emulsified with CFA into the base of the tail (day 0) followed by a booster injection on day 21. To examine the ability of LPS to exacerbate CIA, varying doses of LPS were orally administered on day 50. The results showed that administration of LPS was followed by reactivation of CIA in a dose-related fashion. Histologically, on day 55 there were marked edema of synovium proliferated by day 50, new formation of fibrin, and intense infiltration of neutrophils accompanied with a large number of mononuclear cells. Severe destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone was also observed on day 70. The reactivation of CIA by oral administration of LPS was associated with increase in anti-type II collagen IgG and IgG2a Abs as well as varying kinds of cytokines including IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. Polymyxin B sulfate given either orally or i.v. suppressed the recurrence of CIA. Increased amounts of LPS were found in sera of mice given the endotoxin orally. LPS from Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and its component, lipid A from Escherichia coli, also reactivated the disease. These findings suggest that LPS from intestinal bacteria may play a role in the exacerbation of autoimmune joint inflammation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Tyrosine aminotransferase catalyzes the final step of methionine recycling in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - An aminotransferase which catalyzes the final step in methionine recycling from methylthioadenosine, the conversion of alpha-ketomethiobutyrate to methionine, has been purified from Klebsiella pneumoniae and characterized. The enzyme was found to be a homodimer of 45-kDa subunits, and it catalyzed methionine formation primarily using aromatic amino acids and glutamate as the amino donors. Histidine, leucine, asparagine, and arginine were also functional amino donors but to a lesser extent. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined and found to be almost identical to the N-terminal sequence of both the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium tyrosine aminotransferases (tyrB gene products). The structural gene for the tyrosine aminotransferase was cloned from K. pneumoniae and expressed in E. coli. The deduced amino acid sequence displayed 83, 80, 38, and 34% identity to the tyrosine aminotransferases from E. coli, S. typhimurium, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Rhizobium meliloti, respectively, but it showed less than 13% identity to any characterized eukaryotic tyrosine aminotransferase. Structural motifs around key invariant residues placed the K. pneumoniae enzyme within the Ia subfamily of aminotransferases. Kinetic analysis of the aminotransferase showed that reactions of an aromatic amino acid with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate and of glutamate with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate proceed as favorably as the well-known reactions of tyrosine with alpha-ketoglutarate and tyrosine with oxaloacetate normally associated with tyrosine aminotransferases. The aminotransferase was inhibited by the aminooxy compounds canaline and carboxymethoxylamine but not by substrate analogues, such as nitrotyrosine or nitrophenylalanine.
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - [Electron microscopic study of pathogenic bacteria on environmental objects].
AB  - The morphological picture of different bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus  vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica O3, Y.pseudotuberculosis 1, Y.frederiksenii, Y.intermedia, Y.kristensenii) on environmental objects was studied with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria adhered to the surface of pieces of fodder, egg shell, cabbage leaves and form microcolonies, whose morphology was similar to colonies, grown on nutrient media. The cells produced extracellular substances, seen in SEM as integuments. These integuments were gourd to protect the population from the action of unfavorable factors.
TI  - Syntheses of new isodethiaazacephems as potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - New isodethiaazacephems (+/-)-3, (+/-)-4, and (+/-)-10 as well as the 4-sulfonylated isodethiaazacepham (+/-)-5 were synthesized by chemical methods and found to possess biological activity against five pathogenic microorganisms in vitro. The mesylate and the triflate functionalities in (+/-)-3 and (+/-)-4, acting as effective leaving groups, enhanced remarkably the biological activity in comparison with the parent 3-hydroxyisodethiaazacephem (+/-)-10. The mode of action related to (+/-)-3 and (+/-)-4 can be explained by a [1,4]-elimination process.
TI  - [Protein engineering of uridine phosphorylase from Escherichia coli K-12. I. Cloning and expression of uridine phosphorylase genes from Klebsiella aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium in E. coli].
AB  - Genes of uridine phosphorylases (udp) from Klebsiella aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium were cloned and expressed. Highly effective producer strains of the corresponding proteins were constructed. Enzymic properties of the UPases obtained were studied and compared with those from the Escherichia coli enzyme. Mutant forms of UPase from E. coli (D5E, D5N, D5A) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis techniques. It was shown that the Asp5 residue plays an insignificant role in the formation of the active form of the protein.
TI  - The nac (nitrogen assimilation control) gene from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nitrogen assimilation control gene, nac, was detected in Escherichia coli but not in Salmonella typhimurium by Southern blotting, using a probe from the Klebsiella aerogenes nac (nacK) gene. The E. coli nac gene (nacE) was isolated from a cosmid clone by complementation of a nac mutation in K. aerogenes. nacE was fully functional in this complementation assay. DNA sequence analysis showed considerable divergence between nacE and nacK, with a predicted amino acid sequence identity of only 79% and most of the divergence in the C-terminal half of the protein sequence. The total predicted size of NAC(E) is 305 amino acids, the same as for NAC(K). A null mutation, nac-28, was generated by reverse genetics. Mutants bearing nac-28 have a variety of phenotypes related to nitrogen metabolism, including slower growth on cytosine, faster growth on arginine, and suppression of the failure of an Ntr-constitutive mutant to grow with serine as sole nitrogen source. In addition to a loss of nitrogen regulation of histidase formation, nac-28 mutants also showed a loss of a weak repression of glutamate dehydrogenase formation. This repression was unexpected because it is balanced by a NAC-independent activation of glutamate dehydrogenase formation during nitrogen-limited growth. Attempts to purify NAC(E) by using methods established for NAC(K) failed, and NAC(E) appears to be degraded with a half-life at 30 degrees C as short as 15 min during inhibition of protein synthesis.
TI  - Genetic analysis, using P22 challenge phage, of the nitrogen activator protein DNA-binding site in the Klebsiella aerogenes put operon.
AB  - The nac gene product is a LysR regulatory protein required for nitrogen regulation of several operons from Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli. We used P22 challenge phage carrying the put control region from K. aerogenes to identify the nucleotide residues important for nitrogen assimilation control protein (NAC) binding in vivo. Mutations in an asymmetric 30-bp region prevented DNA binding by NAC. Gel retardation experiments confirmed that NAC specifically binds to this sequence in vitro, but NAC does not bind to the corresponding region from the put operon of Salmonella typhimurium, which is not regulated by NAC.
TI  - Propanediol utilization genes (pdu) of Salmonella typhimurium: three genes for the propanediol dehydratase.
AB  - The propanediol utilization (pdu) operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes proteins required for the catabolism of propanediol, including a coenzyme B12-dependent propanediol dehydratase. A clone that expresses propanediol dehydratase activity was isolated from a Salmonella genomic library. DNA sequence analysis showed that the clone included part of the pduF gene, the pduABCDE genes, and a long partial open reading frame (ORF1). The clone included 3.9 kbp of pdu DNA which had not been previously sequenced. Complementation and expression studies with subclones constructed via PCR showed that three genes (pduCDE) are necessary and sufficient for propanediol dehydratase activity. The function of ORF1 was not determined. Analyses showed that the S. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was related to coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratases from Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Unexpectedly, the S. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was found to be 98% identical in amino acid sequence to the Klebsiella oxytoca propanediol dehydratase; this is a much higher identity than expected, given the relationship between these organisms. DNA sequence analyses also supported previous studies indicating that the pdu operon was inherited along with the adjacent cobalamin biosynthesis operon by a single horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Lung colonization with Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  
TI  - Gene organisation and regulatory sequences in the sucrose utilisation cluster of  Bacillus stearothermophilus NUB36.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the surP and surT genes in a sucrose-utilisation cluster cloned from Bacillus stearothermophilus NUB36 was determined. The surP gene encoded a protein of 466 amino acid residues and shared 60-62% amino acid identity with the sucrose-specific enzyme II components of the phosphotransferase system of Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SurP, like other sucrose EIIs, lacked the hydrophilic domain containing the first (IIA) phosphorylation site. The surT gene encoded a 278 amino acid polypeptide which showed 63.1% and 54% amino acid identity to the B. subtilis antiterminators SacT and SacY, respectively. A region containing a palindromic structure preceding surP was highly homologous to the regulatory transcription termination regions of the sacPA and sacB operons of B. subtilis and the bgl operon of Escherichia coli. Hence the sucrose gene cluster of B. stearothermophilus NUB36 is very similar to the B. subtilis sacPA operon in terms of gene order and regulatory organisation.
TI  - The human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells (M. F. Bernet, D. Brassard, J. R. Neeser, and A. L. Servin, Gut 35:483-489, 1994). Here, we demonstrate that strain LA1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by Salmonella typhimurium. We present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain LA1 (LA1-SCS) contained antibacterial components active against S. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. By contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
TI  - Invasion of cultured human epithelial cells by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the urinary tract.
AB  - The mechanisms which enable entry into cultured human epithelial cells by Klebsiella pneumoniae were compared with those of Salmonella typhi Ty2. K. pneumoniae 3091, isolated from a urine sample of a patient with a urinary tract infection, invaded human epithelial cells from the bladder and ileocecum and persisted for days in vitro. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that K. pneumoniae was always contained in endosomes. The internalization mechanism(s) triggered by K. pneumoniae was studied by invasion assays conducted with different inhibitors that act on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and processes. Chloramphenicol inhibition of bacterial uptake revealed that bacterial de novo protein synthesis was essential for efficient invasion by K. pneumoniae and S. typhi. Interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis by g-strophanthin or monodansylcadaverine and inhibition of endosome acidification by monensin reduced the number of viable intracellular K. pneumoniae cells, but not S. typhi cells. The depolymerization of microfilaments by cytochalasin D inhibited the uptake of both bacteria. Microtubule depolymerization caused by colchicine, demecolcine, or nocodazole and the stabilization of microtubules with taxol reduced only the invasion ability of K. pneumoniae. S. typhi invasion was unaffected by microtubule depolymerization or stabilization. These data suggest that the internalization mechanism triggered by K. pneumoniae 3091 is strikingly different from the solely microfilament-dependent invasion mechanism exhibited by many of the well-studied enteric bacteria, such as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia strains.
TI  - Synergism in biofilm formation between Salmonella enteritidis and a nitrogen-fixing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A laboratory reactor, which simulates biofilm formation in water pipes, was used  to study interactions in biofilm formation between a nitrogen-fixing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enteritidis. The level of attachment of Salm. enteritidis was higher in the binar biofilm than in the single species biofilm. In the initial colonization phase the binary biofilm contained a much higher proportion of metabolically active cells than in single species biofilms formed by either Salm. enteritidis or Kl. pneumoniae. When a pulse of Salm. enteritidis was passed over an already established biofilm of Kl. pneumoniae it rapidly became integrated into the biofilm, from where it was subsequently released into the water column, along with Kl. pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae fixed nitrogen in the presence of Salm. enteritidis in both types of biofilm.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Siderophore activity of chemically synthesized dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives of spermidines and cystamide.
AB  - Chemically synthesized dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives of spermidine and cystamide containing two-, three- and four-bidentates with the hydroxyl groups in 2,3 or 3,4 position were examined in cross-feeding tests using Gram-negative siderophore indicator strains carrying different iron-related markers, and two Mycobacterium spp. The catecholates were unable to feed tonB mutants of E. coli and S. typhimurium as well as the fepA, fiu, cir mutant of E. coli, pointing to a tonB- and fepA, cir, fiu-dependent transport. Bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)derivatives promoted Salmonella spp, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains significantly better than did 3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives. N4-substituted spermidines acted more effectively than non-substituted derivatives. Bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl) cystamide was superior to the other catecholates tested in growth promotion of Gram-negative bacteria. The two four-bidentates and the tri-bidentate reacted to K. pneumoniae in an inhibitory mode. The position of the hydroxyl groups did not significantly influence the growth promotion of M. smegmatis and M. fortiutum in the cases of substituted spermidines and of cystamides.
TI  - Antibodies against bacterial lipopolysaccharides in Japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - We investigated IgG, IgA and IgM class specific antibodies to five bacterial (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri) lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 144 Japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS patients had significantly elevated IgA antibodies to K. pneumoniae LPS, Salmonella enteritidis LPS and Salmonella typhimurium LPS; however, there was no correlation between antibody level to LPS and acute-phase reactants, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein.
TI  - The nucleoside-specific Tsx channel from the outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and DNA sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  - The Escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (Tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. We cloned the structural genes of the Tsx proteins from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them in an E.coli tsx mutant. The heterologous Tsx proteins fully substituted the E.coli Tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin uptake, and as receptor for colicin K. The Tsx proteins from K. pneumoniae and Ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several Tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from S. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. The nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae and Ent. aerogenes was established. Each of the Tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence peptides and the predicted mature forms of the Tsx proteins have a calculated M(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. Multiple sequence alignments between the Tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. Most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one of these hypervariable domains in the S. typhimurium Tsx protein. When this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the E.coli tsx gene, the mutant Tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin K receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. Multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized Tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the Tsx protein within the outer membrane.
TI  - The gnd gene encoding a novel 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and its adjacent region of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA.
AB  - A 10-kb DNA fragment containing the gnd gene from Actinobacillus actinomy-cetemcomitans Y4 was isolated and sequenced. The structural gnd gene codes for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase that consists of 484 amino acids. In contrast to the gnd gene in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, or Klebsiella pneumoniae, the gnd gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was not located in the rfb or cps operon. The zwf gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is another enzyme consisting of pentose-phosphate pathway, sided at 3.8-kb upstream from the gnd gene. A phylogenetic tree based on sequence analyses showed higher homology of 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase of A. actinomycetemcomitans with the eucaryotic enzymes rather than with bacterial enzymes.
TI  - Reduced susceptibility to co-amoxiclav in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Romania between 1985 and 1993.
AB  - By determining the beta-lactam susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Eastern Romania from 1985 to 1993, three Escherichia coli, three Salmonella typhimurium and one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to co-amoxiclav were found. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates and their E. coli derivatives, and kinetic values suggested the following resistance mechanisms: hyperproduction of TEM in S. typhimurium, limited antibiotic uptake in K. pneumoniae and OXA production in one strain of E. coli. Despite a normal beta-lactamase activity, the two remaining E. coli strains and their derivatives were less susceptible to co-amoxiclav.
TI  - Mutational analysis of the CitA citrate transporter from Salmonella typhimurium:  altered substrate specificity.
AB  - The CitA citrate transporter in Salmonella typhimurium is encoded by the citA gene and consists of 434 amino acid residues that probably include 12 membrane-spanning segments [Shimamoto. T., et al. (1991) J. Biochem. 110, 22-28]. CitA mutants with altered substrate specificities were isolated by in vitro mutagenesis using nitrous acid. The mutants could grow on isocitrate as a sole carbon source which normally cannot be transported well by the CitA transporter of S. typhimurium. The mutation sites in the citA gene of the nine mutants were determined to involve single residues at seven sites (one mutation per mutant). The original amino acid residues at these sites (Arg-19, Ala-38, Glu-51, Gly-132, Ala-169, Pro-262 and Leu-271) were identified to be responsible for the altered substrate specificity. All these amino acid residues were conserved in four other homologous citrate transporters from Escherichia coli, Citrobacter amalonaticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are suggested to be involved in substrate recognition by the CitA transporter.
TI  - Growth suppression in early-stationary-phase nutrient broth cultures of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli is genus specific and not regulated by sigma S.
AB  - We have studied the growth suppression seen in early-stationary-phase LB broth cultures of Salmonella typhimurium. Multiplication of small numbers of an antibiotic-resistant S. typhimurium mutant was prevented when the mutant was added to 24-h cultures of the antibiotic-sensitive parent strain, whereas an antibiotic-resistant mutant of an Escherichia coli strain added to the same culture grew well. A 24-h E. coli culture produced a similar specific bacteriostatic inhibition against E. coli. In older cultures, a specific bactericidal effect similar to that observed by M. M. Zambrano and R. Kolter (J. Bacteriol. 175:5642-5647, 1993) was also observed. Whether incubated statically or shaken, sufficient nutrients were present in the filtered supernatants of 24-h cultures for small inocula of the same strain to multiply to ca. 10(9) CFU/ml after reincubation. Introduction of the rpoS mutation had no effect on the specific bacteriostatic inhibition. Similar specific inhibition was also observed in strains of Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Shigella spp. Experiments in which the 24-h culture was physically separated from the antibiotic-resistant mutant by using a dialysis membrane were carried out. These results indicated that the inhibition might be mediated by a diffusible but labile chemical mediator.
TI  - Biofilm formation by the enterobacteriaceae: a comparison between salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli and a nitrogen-fixing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A simple laboratory reactor, which simulates biofilm formation in pipes, was used to compare biofilm formation by three members of the Enterobacteriaceae, namely, an environmental, nitrogen-fixing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a pathogen, Salmonella enteritidis, and a faecal indicator, Escherichia coli. All three attached to CVCP pipe surfaces in the reactor and formed substantial biofilm populations of over a million bacteria cm-2 within 24 h. These populations increased by approximately 10-fold over the next 48 h. Estimates of the numbers of metabolically active cells and the ratios of viable to direct counts showed that Kl. pneumoniae formed the densest and most metabolically active biofilms, followed by Salm. enteritidis and E. coli, respectively. Nitrogen fixation and polysaccharide production (EPS) by Kl. pneumoniae occurred only in mature biofilms and were of no selective advantage in the initiation of biofilms. Despite producing more EPS the rate of attachment of Salm. enteritidis was lower than for Kl. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative microbicidal activity of synovial fluid on arthritogenic organisms.
AB  - There is strong circumstantial evidence to support the concept that local microbial antigens play a key role in the synovitis of reactive arthritis (ReA) patients. It is not at all clear whether these antigens reflect the sequelae of previously viable organisms once resident in the joint. To address the microbicidal activity of synovial fluid (SF) we performed quantitative cultures of arthritogenic organisms (Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and controls (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) in the presence of SF from patients with ReA. There was a dramatic inhibitory effect of SF on the Gram-negative organisms (mean 1.35x10(5) organisms at 3h; 0 organisms at 24 h) in contrast to Staph. aureus (1.61x10(5) at 3h; 5.70x10(5) at 24 h). This SF bactericidal phenomenon was observed in 11/11 ReA patients, 5/8 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 1/8 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Using a sandwich ELISA, we measured SF levels of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). BPI was detectable in all ReA SF (range 4.6-333ng/ml)) and RA SF (range 343-2570ng/ml), but was absent in 5/6 OA SF tested. Anti-BPI antibodies, however, did not fully neutralize the bactericidal activity of inflammatory SF. In contrast to the SF effects observed on Gram-negative bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis cultured within HeLa cells thrived in the presence of SF. Indeed extracellular Chlamydia could easily be passaged through cultured synovial fibroblasts in the presence of SF. These findings indicate that the potent microbicidal activity of SF may account for the failure to recover viable organisms from the joint in ReA. Chlamydia alone amongst these organisms demonstrates resistance to microbicidal effect of SF, which may relate to the pathogenesis of Chlamydia-induced arthritis.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Chemosensory responses of Acanthamoeba castellanii: visual analysis of random movement and responses to chemical signals.
AB  - A visual assay slide chamber was used in conjunction with time-lapse videomicroscopy to analyze chemotactic behavior of axenically grown Acanthamoeba castellanii. Data were collected and analyzed as vector scatter diagrams and cell tracks. Amebas responded to a variety of bacterial products or potential bacterial products by moving actively toward the attractant. Responses to the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), lipopolysaccharide, and lipid A were statistically significant (P < or = 0.03), as was the response to fMLP benzylamide (P < or = 0.05). Significant responses to cyclic AMP, lipoteichoic acid, and N-acetyl glucosamine were also found. Chemotactic peptide antagonists, mannose, mannosylated bovine serum albumin, and N-acetyl muramic acid all yielded nonsignificant responses (P > 0.05). There was no single optimal concentration for response to any of the attractants tested, and amebas responded equally over the range of concentrations tested. Pretreatment of amebas with chemotactic peptides, bacterial products, and bacteria reduced the directional response to attractants. Amebas that had been grown in the presence of bacteria appeared more responsive to chemotactic peptides. Treatment of amebas with trypsin reduced the response of cells to chemotactic peptides, though sensitivity was restored within a couple of hours. This suggests the ameba membrane may have receptors, sensitive to these bacterial substances, which are different from the mannose receptors involved in binding bacteria to the membrane during phagocytosis. The rate of movement was relatively constant (ca. 0.40 microns/s), indicating that the locomotor response to these signals is a taxis, or possibly a klinokinesis, but not an orthokinesis. Studies of the population diffusion rate in the absence of signals indicate that the basic population motility follows the pattern of a Levy walk, rather than the more familiar Gaussian diffusion. This suggests that the usual mathematical models of ameboid dispersion may need to be modified.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the scrA and scrB genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae and plasmid pUR400, which encode the sucrose transport protein Enzyme II Scr of the phosphotransferase system and a sucrose-6-phosphate invertase.
AB  - The Klebsiella pneumoniae genes scrA and scrB are indispensable for sucrose (Scr) utilisation. Gene scrA codes for an Enzyme IIScr (IIScr) transport protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate: phosphotransferase system (PTS), while scrB encodes a sucrose 6-phosphate specific invertase. A 3.7 kbscr AB DNA fragment has been cloned from K. pneumoniae and expressed in Escherichia coli. Its nucleotide sequence was determined and the coding regions for scrA (1371 bp) and scrB (1401 bp) were identified by genetic complementation, enzyme activity test and radiolabelling of the gene products. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the scrB gene from conjugative plasmid pUR400 isolated from Salmonella typhimurium was also determined and errors in the previously published sequence of the scrA gene of pUR400 were corrected. Extensive similarity was found between the sequences of ScrA and other Enzymes II, as well as between the two invertases and other sucrose hydrolysing enzymes. Based on the analysis of seven IIScr proteins, a hypothetical model of the secondary structure of IIScr is proposed.
TI  - Screening of in vitro antibacterial activity from Syzygium Guineense (Willd) hydrosoluble dry extract.
AB  - Diarrhoea is one of the most important causes of infant mortality in the world. As modern drugs are expensive or unavailable in developing countries, many people use traditional medicines in Africa for the treatment of several diseases. In our study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of Syzygium Guineense extract in order to assess its activity on some bacterial strains involved in diarrhoeal diseases and to justify its use. The aqueous dry extract was prepared by decoction followed by evaporating to dryness and tested according to dilution method. This extract showed an antibacterial activity against some bacterial strains: Salmonella E., Shigella D., Shigella F., E. Coli., Enterobacter A. It did not show any activity against Citrobacter F., Proteus M., Klebsiella P. Storage conditions (27 degrees C, glass flask) did not affect antibacterial properties of the extract.
TI  - Detection of bacterial pyrogens on the basis of their effects on gamma interferon-mediated formation of neopterin or nitrite in cultured monocyte cell lines.
AB  - In a number of mammalian cell types, pteridine biosynthesis from guanosine 5'-triphosphate and formation of nitric oxide from L-arginine are induced by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We assessed the possibility of using such metabolic alterations for the in vitro detection of pyrogens. Products from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and related synthetic compounds were tested for their potential to induce either of these pathways. Stimulation of pteridine biosynthesis was monitored as the formation of neopterin in the human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1. The formation of nitric oxide was determined as nitrite in murine J774A.1 macrophage cultures. The substances tested included toxic and detoxified parts of LPS and lipid A from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella minnesota, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as lipoteichoic acid and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 from Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, two cell wall compounds from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, which are active components of Freund's adjuvant, were used. When applied as a single stimulus, only the whole LPS molecule potently stimulated neopterin or nitrite formation. Lipid A and products from gram-positive bacteria were weakly active. For neopterin formation, lipid A required the presence of fetal calf serum. Besides detoxified LPS and independently from the presence of serum, all bacterial compounds tested strongly increased the effects mediated by IFN-gamma. Our results show that bacterial pyrogens can be detected by monitoring the formation of neopterin or nitrite. This may provide a basis for the development of an in vitro assay for the detection of pyrogenic contamination with the aim of replacing the currently used animal test.
TI  - Development and evaluation of two novel oligonucleotide probes based on 16S rRNA  sequence for the identification of Salmonella in foods.
AB  - DNA sequence in the V3 to V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene of Salmonella enteritidis was determined. By comparison of this sequence with those of Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris obtained from GenBank/EMBL database, three oligonucleotides termed as 16S I, 16S II and 16S III were synthesized. Hybridization of these oligonucleotides with 325 Salmonella isolates and some non-Salmonella isolates including the Salmonella closely related species of the family of Enterobacteriaceae showed that 16S II could not be used as a Salmonella specific-probe. 16S I and 16S III hybridized with all the Salmonella isolates tested, the former also hybridizing with Citrobacter spp. and the latter hybridizing with Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as Serratia marcescens. Since enrichment of the target cells in food samples was usually required prior to the DNA hybridization assay, the interference from those non-Salmonella isolates could be prevented by enrichment by culturing in lactose-combined tetrathionate (CTET) broth followed by Gram-negative (GN) broth at 37 degrees C and/or 43 degrees C. Such a culture step could inhibit the growth of Klebsiella spp., Ser. marcescens and/or Citrobacter spp. and allowed the specific detection of Salmonella.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of Lrp is highly conserved in four enteric microorganisms.
AB  - Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) is a global regulator of metabolism in Escherichia coli (J. M. Calvo and R. G. Matthews, Microbiol. Rev. 58:466-490, 1994). The lrp genes from three other enteric microorganisms, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium, were cloned and sequenced. An analysis of these sequences and of the previously determined sequence from E. coli indicated that the vast majority of changes were synonymous rather than nonsynonymous changes. Nucleotide changes occurred at 89 of 492 positions but resulted in amino acid changes at only 2 of 164 positions. This analysis suggests that the Lrp amino acid sequence is highly adapted for function and that almost all amino acid changes lead to a protein that functions less well than the wild-type protein.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a substance produced by the fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (Fr.) Murr.
AB  - A fraction obtained from the culture fluids of Pycnoporus sanguineus fungus was shown to contain a compound with biological activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and members of the genus Streptococcus. The fraction was clearly more active on Gram-positive cocci than on Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - A versatile vector for controlled expression of genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - We have constructed two expression vectors based on the pJF118HE vector developed for Escherichia coli by Furste et al. [Gene 48 (1986) 119-131]. The tac promoter (ptac) was exchanged for the trc promoter (ptrc) and an NdeI site was created at the appropriate distance from the ribosome-binding site. The NdeI site permits cloning of a gene at its translation start point without altering the amino-acid sequence of the synthesized protein, while ptrc and the lacIQ gene confer inducible and controlable expression. We have tested these plasmids in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a Citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  - A Citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. Metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. Amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phoN product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. These organisms, together with Klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. The coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating Citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.
TI  - The Salmonella typhimurium invasion genes invF and invG encode homologues of the  AraC and PulD family of proteins.
AB  - We have identified two novel Salmonella typhimurium genes, invF and invG, which are required for the efficient entry of these organisms into cultured epithelial cells. invF and invG are located immediately upstream of invE, a previously identified gene also required for Salmonella entry. Non-polar mutations in these genes rendered S. typhimurium severely deficient for entry into cultured epithelial cells. The nucleotide sequences of invF and invG indicated that these genes encode polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 24,373 and 62,275, respectively. Proteins of similar sizes were observed when invF and invG were expressed in a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-based expression system. Comparison of the predicted sequence of InvF with translated sequences in the existing databases indicated that this protein is homologous to members of the AraC family of prokaryotic transcription regulators. However, mutations in invF did not significantly affect the expression of other members of the inv locus. InvG was found to be homologous to members of the PulD family of specialized translocases. This homology suggests that InvG may be necessary for the export of invasion-related determinants or involved in the assembly of a supramolecular structure that promotes entry.
TI  - Characterization of the CysB protein of Klebsiella aerogenes: direct evidence that N-acetylserine rather than O-acetylserine serves as the inducer of the cysteine regulon.
AB  - The cysB gene of Klebsiella aerogenes has been cloned, sequenced and shown to complement the cysteine auxotrophic phenotype of Escherichia coli cysB mutants. The K. aerogenes cysB gene is predicted to encode a protein of 324 amino acid residues that shares approx. 95% sequence similarity with the Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli CysB proteins. Gel-retardation assays demonstrate that the purified protein binds to DNA fragments containing either the K. aerogenes cysb promoter or the S. typhimurium cysJIH promoter. Acetylserine enhances CysB binding to the cysJIH promoter fragment while diminishing its binding to the cysB promoter fragment. Fluorescence-emission-spectroscopy measurements suggest strongly that N-acetylserine binds to CysB apoprotein but that O-acetylserine does not, and support the notion that N-acetylserine is the physiological inducer of cysteine biosynthesis.
TI  - Anaerobic growth of Salmonella typhimurium on L(+)- and D(-)-tartrate involves an oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump.
AB  - We show here that the Enterobacterium Salmonella typhimurium LT2 has the capacity to grow anaerobically on L(+)- or D(-)-tartrate as sole carbon and energy source. Growth on these substrates was Na(+)-dependent and involved the L(+)- or D(-)-tartrate-inducible expression of oxaloacetate decarboxylase. The induced decarboxylase was closely related to the oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump of Klebsiella pneumoniae as shown by the sensitivity towards avidin, the location in the cytoplasmic membrane, activation by Na+ ions, and Western blot analysis with antiserum raised against the K. pneumoniae oxaloacetate decarboxylase. Participation of an oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump in L(+)-tartrate degradation by S. typhimurium is in accord with results from DNA analyses. The deduced protein sequence of the open reading frame identified upstream of the recently sequenced oxaloacetate decarboxylase genes is clearly homologous with the beta-subunit of L-tartrate dehydratase from Escherichia coli. Southern blot analysis with S. typhimurium chromosomal DNA indicated the presence of probably more than one gene for oxaloacetate decarboxylase.
TI  - Secondary solute transport in bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Replicon typing characterization of plasmids encoding resistance to gentamicin and apramycin in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium isolated from human and animal sources in Belgium.
AB  - Escherichia coli and salmonella strains with plasmids conferring resistance to gentamicin and apramycin have been isolated with increasing frequency both from cattle and hospital patients in Belgium. The apramycin-gentamicin resistance plasmids were characterized in recipient strains by their profiles and molecular weights using agarose gel electrophoresis, by their antimicrobial resistance patterns and by replicon typing using a series of DNA probes specific for the genes controlling their systems of replication. Overall, most of the plasmids differed in their DNA electrophoretic patterns. Seventeen different antimicrobial resistance profiles were observed, and there were six different types of replicons. However, two replication genes predominated and had a preferential distribution in different bacterial species. The rep FIC.a plus rep Q multireplicon was found mainly in plasmids recovered from gentamicin- and apramycin-resistant E. coli while replicon of the type rep FIC.b largely prevailed in S. typhimurium. Identical replication genes were found in most animal and human strains, hence suggesting a high homology between apramycin-gentamicin plasmids in these communities. Finally, our results indicate that the rapid spread of apramycin-gentamicin-resistance in several species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from animals and from humans in Belgium is not due to a single plasmid, but rather that the gene encoding AAC(3)-IV is carried by various replicons.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro susceptibility and emergence of mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin among multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy-seven multidrug resistant clinical isolates [K. pneumoniae, (N = 87); E coli, (N = 30); Salmonella typhimurium (N = 100); P. aeruginosa, (N = 30); S. aureus, (N = 30)] from hospitalized patients specimens, were tested in vitro for sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin. Application of the disk diffusion test and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration by the microdilution method indicated that, almost all isolates were sensitive to the drug. Overall, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the less sensitive organisms. Ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of > or = 10(-5)/CFU.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Klebsiella pneumoniae tonB gene and characterization of Escherichia coli-K. pneumoniae TonB hybrid proteins.
AB  - The tonB gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned on a 1.4-kb EcoRV fragment and  expressed in Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment identified tonB as an open reading frame (ORF) of 729 nt. The TonB protein consists of 243 amino acids (aa) and is highly homologous to Enterobacter aerogenes TonB. The genetic context of K. pneumoniae and En. aerogenes tonB is the same, but is different from that of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Serratia marcescens. K. pneumoniae tonB complemented an E. coli tonB mutant as efficiently as E. coli tonB when cloned on the same type of plasmid. Replacement of the highly hydrophobic C terminus of E. coli TonB by the weakly hydrophobic C terminus of K. pneumoniae TonB yielded a hybrid protein of the same activity as E. coli wild-type TonB. The result shows that the strong hydrophobicity of the C-terminal end is not necessary for the function of E. coli TonB.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequencing of infC, the gene encoding translation initiation factor IF3, from four enterobacterial species.
AB  - Translation initiation factor IF3 plays a crucial role in initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria. In order to elucidate the IF3 structural elements required for these functions, the evolutionary conservation of IF3 and its gene, infC, was investigated. Homologous infC sequences from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Analysis of these sequences, as well as that from Bacillus stearothermophilus, revealed several regions (e.g. residues 62-73 and 173-177) of absolute sequence conservation, suggesting an important role for these regions in IF3 function.
TI  - Molecular analysis of two ScrR repressors and of a ScrR-FruR hybrid repressor for sucrose and D-fructose specific regulons from enteric bacteria.
AB  - The scr regulon of pUR400 and the chromosomally encoded scr regulon of Klebsiella pneumoniae KAY2026 are both negatively controlled by a specific repressor (ScrR). As deduced from the nucleotide sequences, both scrR genes encode polypeptides of 334 residues (85.5% identical base pairs, 91.3% identical amino acids), containing an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif. Comparison with other regulatory proteins revealed 30.6% identical amino acids to FruR, 27.0% to Lacl and 28.1% to GalR. Six scrRs super-repressor mutations define the inducer-binding domain. The scr operator sequences were identified by in vivo titration tests of the sucrose repressor and by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays. D-fructose, an intracellular product of sucrose transport and hydrolysis, and D-fructose 1-phosphate were shown to be molecular inducers of both scr regulons. An active ScrR-FruR hybrid repressor protein was constructed with the N-terminal part of the sucrose repressor of K. pneumoniae and the C-terminal part of the fructose repressor of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. Gel retardation assays showed that the hybrid protein bound to scr-specific operators, and that D-fructose 1-phosphate, the inducer for FruR, was the only inducer. In vivo, neither the operators of the fru operon nor of the pps operon, the natural targets for FruR, were recognized, but the scr operators were. These data and the data obtained from the super-repressor alleles confirm previous models on the binding of repressors of the Lacl family to their operators.
TI  - Effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. The blood was inoculated with one of five species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per mL. The growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees C storage period of the platelet concentrates. One species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, failed to grow in any of the components. The remaining species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by Day 3. Although the concentration of bacteria immediately after inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. Data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.
TI  - Characterization of three fimbrial genes, sefABC, of Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - Salmonella enteritidis produces thin, filamentous fimbriae designated SEF14. A 3.9-kb region of a 5.3-kb fragment encoding genes responsible for SEF14 biosynthesis was sequenced and found to contain three genes, sefABC. sefA encoded a novel fimbrin, the structural subunit of SEF14 fimbriae. sefB and sefC encoded proteins homologous to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae fimbrial periplasmic chaperone proteins and fimbrial outer membrane proteins, respectively, and are the first such genes to be characterized from Salmonella spp. in vitro expression directed by the 5.3-kb DNA fragment identified SefA, SefB, and SefC as approximately 14,000-, 28,000-, and 90,000-M(r) proteins, respectively, which correlated with their predicted amino acid sequences. sefB and sefC were not expressed in the absence of sefA. Primer extension analysis of sefABC revealed two major transcription start sites located upstream of sefA. Transcription of sefBC also initiated from the sefA promoter region. Secondary-structure analysis of the mRNA transcript for sefABC predicted the formation of two stable stem-loop structures in the intercistronic region between sefA and sefB indicative of differential regulation of SefA, SefB, and SefC translation. E. coli cells carrying the 5.3-kb DNA fragment of S. enteritidis DNA were unable to assemble distinguishable SEF14 fimbriae; however, immunogold-labelled SEF14 fimbriae were displayed on E. coli clones containing a 44-kb DNA fragment which encompassed the 5.3-kb region. Therefore, sefABC genes make up part of a complex sef operon responsible for the expression and assembly of SEF14 fimbriae.
TI  - Ileal perforation in typhoid: bacteriological and immunological findings.
AB  - In typhoid perforation patients, Salmonella typhi was isolated from blood in 4%,  ileal contents in 23%, peritoneal pus in 13% and from mesenteric lymph nodes in 71%. While isolation of S. typhi was made from patients with less than 4 days of chloramphenicol therapy, cultures were negative from these sites after 5 days of therapy; however, S. typhi appeared to remain viable in the lymph nodes even after such therapy. All isolates of S. typhi were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Significant SAT titers (0 > or = 1/240) were obtained in only 7/21 (33%) of patients. The perforated group had lower geometric mean titers (0-1/138; H-1/46), when compared to matched patients with uncomplicated typhoid fever (0-1/476; H-1/148). This difference was significant (0- p < 0.005; H- p < 0.0025). The two groups (uncomplicated and perforated) showed no significant difference in total serum IgG, IgM and IgA or isohemagglutinin levels, indicating that the apparent hyporeactivity was not due to a generalized humoral immunodeficiency. Mesenteric lymph node histology showed hyporeactivity in both the T cell and B cell zones. These findings are discussed with the suggestion that S. typhi-specific host immunological hyporeactivity could be an explanation for these observations and a basis for the pathogenesis of perforation. Aerobic cultures of the peritoneal pus gave 39 isolates from 25 patients; the predominant isolates were Escherichia coli (24) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12). On no occasion was S. typhi the predominant isolate. Gentamicin and kanamycin were the only two antibiotics which were consistently effective in vitro against the aerobic isolates from peritoneal pus.
TI  - Bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs) are present in the genome of Klebsiella.
AB  - Bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs) constitute a family of highly repetitive sequences containing palindromic units (PUs), also called repetitive extragenic palindromes (REPs). BIMEs were originally described in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. We show here, by determining the nucleotide sequence of two intergenic regions of Klebsiella pneumoniae, by computer searches, and by hybridization, that sequences with similar characteristics are found in the genome of several Klebsiella species. This reinforces the idea that BIMEs play general and important roles in enterobacteria such as in the organization of the bacterial chromosome.
TI  - Sequence of the sodium ion pump oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - A genomic library of Salmonella typhimurium DNA was constructed in the lambda-phage EMBL3 and screened by immunoblotting for expression of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase alpha-subunit. After subcloning on plasmids the entire sequence of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase was determined. The genes encoding subunits gamma (oadG), alpha (oadA), and beta (oadB) of the decarboxylase are clustered on the chromosome in that order. A typical consensus sequence of a promoter is not found upstream of the oadG gene, but putative ribosome binding regions can be identified before each subunit gene. The amino acid sequences are highly homologous to those of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Klebsiella pneumoniae with 71% identity between the gamma-subunits, 92% identity between the alpha-subunits, and 93% identity between the beta-subunits. The homology between the corresponding beta-subunits appeared to exist only between the 312 N-terminal amino acid residues. It was shown that a cloning artifact has occurred during DNA sequence determination of the beta-subunit from K. pneumoniae and has led to erroneous results. The sequence of this polypeptide is corrected in the Appendix to this paper. A plasmid encoding the three oad genes and that for the anaerobic citrate carrier (citS) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA and used for sequence determination.
TI  - Proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil elastase converts inactive storage proforms to antibacterial bactenecins.
AB  - Bac5 and Bac7, antibiotics of the bactenecin (proline/arginine-rich peptide) family, are stored as proforms in the large granules of bovine neutrophils [Zanetti, M., Litteri, L., Gennaro, R., Horstmann, H. and Romeo, D. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 1363-1371]. These proforms have been purified to homogeneity from granule extracts by immunoaffinity and reverse-phase chromatography. While mature bactenecins efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6-12 micrograms/ml, proBac5 and proBac7 do not affect the growth of the same microorganisms, even at 500 micrograms/ml. Previous investigations have suggested that the conversion of probactenecins into mature antimicrobial peptides is catalyzed by a neutral serine protease stored in the azurophil granules. Purified proBac5 and proBac7 were thus treated with elastase, cathepsin G or proteinase 3, which constitute the pool of neutral serine proteases of the azurophils, and the reaction products were identified by Western blot analysis, mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis. Of the three proteases, only elastase is able to catalyze the stepwise cleavage of probactenecins into the corresponding mature peptides, which have the same mass, N-terminal sequence and antibiotic activity of authentic Bac5 and Bac7. These results point to the importance of cooperation between azurophils and large granules in mounting a defense reaction.
TI  - Completion of the nucleotide sequence of the 'maltose B' region in Salmonella typhimurium: the high conservation of the malM gene suggests a selected physiological role for its product.
AB  - We have subcloned and sequenced the genes malF and malM of Salmonella typhimurium, thereby completing the determination of the nucleotide sequence of its 'maltose B' regulon. The malM gene, encoding a periplasmic protein of unknown function in Escherichia coli, is a highly conserved as genes encoding proteins of known function from the same region.
TI  - Distribution of an L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  - A protein carboxyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues. A similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. In this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. DNA probes from the E. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal DNA of the enteric species. Interestingly, no activity was found in the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in Rhizobium meliloti or Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. Additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species Bacillus subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces griseus. The absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence of inhibitors in the extracts. These results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. Since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal cellular physiology.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on Staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Salmonella typhimurium (Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re of LPS mutants) and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (209P, Cowan I, Smith diffuse and Smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and K) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. Escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, such as Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. Lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against M. lysodeikticus and B. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. With regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, NP1, NP4, and NP5, NP1 showed strong bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. Neither NP4 nor NP5 showed any bactericidal activity, while NP5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of NP1 against K. pneumoniae 277.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to interleukin-8 by endotoxins  of various bacteria.
AB  - The effects of endotoxins from various bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhosa, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to formyl peptide and interleukin-8 were tested in an improved chemotaxis assay involving a "sparse-pore" polycarbonate (Nuclepore) membrane in a Boyden-type chamber. The possible chemotactic activity of the endotoxins themselves were tested by the same technique. In addition, the effects of these substances on random motility of neutrophils were tested with a corresponding assay involving similar chambers fitted with membranes of standard pore density. Possible activation of the complement system of serum by each endotoxin was tested with sheep erythrocyte assays and the maximum endotoxin concentration (100 micrograms/ml) used in the chemotaxis and motility assays. All endotoxins inhibited chemotaxis of neutrophils to interleukin-8. No endotoxin affected chemotaxis to formyl peptide or was itself chemotactic for neutrophils. Endotoxin of S. flexneri inhibited random motility of neutrophils, while the others had no such effect. Endotoxins of K. pneumoniae and of P. aeruginosa produced moderate and marked inhibition, respectively, of total complement, as measured by hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, without affecting the levels of C3c and C4 in these assays. Endotoxins of the other bacteria had no demonstrable effect in any of these assays of complement activation. These results suggest that chemotaxis to interleukin-8 may be mediated by cellular mechanisms different from those involved in chemotaxis to formyl peptide. Furthermore, the presence of these endotoxins could be significant for the suppression of neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory lesions mediated by interleukin-8.
TI  - Klebsiella aerogenes catabolite gene activator protein and the gene encoding it (crp).
AB  - The catabolite gene activator protein from Klebsiella aerogenes (CAPK) and the corresponding protein from Escherichia coli (CAPE) were shown to be nearly identical. Both CAPK and CAPE activated transcription from the CAP-dependent promoters derived from E. coli and K. aerogenes. The crp gene from K. aerogenes (encoding CAP) is tightly linked to rpsL. The nucleotide sequence of crp predicts an amino acid sequence for CAPK that differs in only one position from that of CAPE.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene (citA) encoding a citrate carrier from Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - A cryptic citrate transport gene (citA) from Salmonella typhimurium chromosome was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The cloned plasmid conferred citrate-utilizing ability on wild-type Escherichia coli, which cannot grow on citrate as the sole source of carbon. The resultant E. coli transformant was able to transport citrate. A 1,302-base-pair open reading frame with a preceding ribosomal binding site was found in the cloned DNA fragment. The 434-amino-acid protein that could be translated from this open reading frame is highly hydrophobic (69% nonpolar amino acid residues), consistent with the fact that the transport protein is an intrinsic membrane protein. The molecular weight of this protein was calculated to be 47,188. The gene sequence determined is highly homologous to those of Cit+ plasmid-mediated citrate transport gene, citA, from E. coli, the chromosomal citA gene from Citrobacter amalonaticus and the chromosomal cit+ gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The hydropathy profile of the deduced amino acid sequence suggests that this carrier has 12 hydrophobic segments, which may span the membrane lipid bilayer.
TI  - [The mutagenicity of a new multicomponent vaccine made from the antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Escherichia coli].
AB  - Inactivated bacterial vaccine, containing K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. vulgaris and E. coli antigenic complexes were tested for mutagenicity in the test described by Ames et al. and in vivo, in experiments on mice. In Salmonella typhimurium cells, strain TA-98 and TA-100, the preparation (5-75 mg/ml) did not increase the frequency of reversions and histidine-independence either in direct experiments or after metabolic activation with rat liver homogenate. In experiments on mice the vaccine (3.3 mg/kg and 33 mg/kg) did not induce chromosomal anomalies in spermatogonia. In all experiments the mutagens used for positive control produced a mutagenic effect.
TI  - Antigenic homology among gram-negative organisms isolated from cattle with clinical mastitis.
AB  - This study examined the degree of serologic homology among mastitis pathogens. Antibodies were raised against the Rc mutant, Escherichia coli O111:B4 (strain J5) and affinity purified against lipopolysaccharide derived from the Ra mutant, Salmonella typhimurium TV119. These antibodies reacted with a battery of unrelated Gram-negative bacteria in whole cell ELISA. Bacteria with strong cross-reactions included a heterologous, smooth E. coli, Salmonella dublin, S. typhimurium, Salmonella newport, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recognition of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchisepticum was observed, but reactions were weaker than with the other isolates. The reduced recognition of these isolates probably reflects a masking effect of the bacterial capsule and variations in lipopolysaccharide structure. The polyclonal antibody did not recognize a Gram-positive isolate, Staphylococcus aureus. These immunoglobulins were then tested using whole cell ELISA against a panel of bacteria recovered from the mammary glands of cattle with clinical mastitis. Marked reactivity was noted against a variety of Gram-negative pathogens. Gram-positive isolates had lower recognition by Gram-negative core antigen specific immunoglobulin. The results suggest immunization with rough mutant bacteria may have broad application in the prevention of coliform mastitis.
TI  - ERIC sequences: a novel family of repetitive elements in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and other enterobacteria.
AB  - We describe a family of highly conserved, Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) sequences, 14 of which have been identified in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and a further three in other enterobacterial species (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Vibrio cholerae). ERIC sequences are 126 bp long and appear to be restricted to transcribed regions of the genome, either in intergenic regions of polycistronic operons or in untranslated regions upstream or downstream of open reading frames. ERIC sequences are highly conserved at the nucleotide sequence level but their chromosomal locations differ between species. Several features of ERIC sequences resemble those of REP sequences (Stern et al., 1984) although the nucleotide sequence is entirely different. The question of whether ERICs have a specific function, or represent a form of 'selfish' DNA, is discussed.
TI  - Aztreonam for treating meningitis caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - 10 patients with meningitis due to unusual gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas,  Proteus, Salmonella and Klebsiella) were effectively treated with aztreonam. A detailed history and a thorough physical examination combined with careful laboratory testing resulted in accurate diagnosis and cure of all patients.
TI  - Cloning of the Klebsiella aerogenes nac gene, which encodes a factor required for nitrogen regulation of the histidine utilization (hut) operons in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The nac (nitrogen assimilation control) gene from Klebsiella aerogenes, cloned in a low-copy-number cloning vector, restored the ability of K. aerogenes nac mutants to activate histidase and repress glutamate dehydrogenase formation in response to nitrogen limitation and to limit the maximum expression of the nac promoter. When present in Salmonella typhimurium, the K. aerogenes nac gene allowed the hut genes to be activated during nitrogen-limited growth. Thus, the nac gene encodes a cytoplasmic factor required for activation of hut expression in S. typhimurium during nitrogen-limited growth.
TI  - Remnants of an ancient pathway to L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine in enteric bacteria: evolutionary implications and biotechnological impact.
AB  - The pathway construction for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in Escherichia  coli is atypical of the phylogenetic subdivision of gram-negative bacteria to which it belongs (R. A. Jensen, Mol. Biol. Evol. 2:92-108, 1985). Related organisms possess second pathways to phenylalanine and tyrosine which depend upon the expression of a monofunctional chorismate mutase (CM-F) and cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (CDT). Some enteric bacteria, unlike E. coli, possess either CM-F or CDT. These essentially cryptic remnants of an ancestral pathway can be a latent source of biochemical potential under certain conditions. As one example of advantageous biochemical potential, the presence of CM-F in Salmonella typhimurium increases the capacity for prephenate accumulation in a tyrA auxotroph. We report the finding that a significant fraction of the latter prephenate is transaminated to L-arogenate. The tyrA19 mutant is now the organism of choice for isolation of L-arogenate, uncomplicated by the presence of other cyclohexadienyl products coaccumulated by a Neurospora crassa mutant that had previously served as the prime biological source of L-arogenate. Prephenate aminotransferase activity was not conferred by a discrete enzyme, but rather was found to be synonymous with the combined activities of aspartate aminotransferase (aspC), aromatic aminotransferase (tyrB), and branched-chain aminotransferase (ilvE). This conclusion was confirmed by results obtained with combinations of aspC-, tyrB-, and ilvE-deficient mutations in E. coli. An example of disadvantageous biochemical potential is the presence of a cryptic CDT in Klebsiella pneumoniae, where a mutant carrying multiple enzyme blocks is the standard organism used for accumulation and isolation of chorismate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of SHV-2 beta-lactamase gene.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase SHV-2 from Salmonella  typhimurium (SHV-2pHT1) was determined. The gene was very similar to chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase LEN-1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Compared with the sequence of the Escherichia coli SHV-2 enzyme (SHV-2E.coli) obtained by protein sequencing, the deduced amino acid sequence of SHV-2pHT1 differed by three amino acid substitutions.
TI  - Evidence for the ability of L10 ribosomal proteins of Salmonella typhimurium and  Klebsiella pneumoniae to regulate rplJL gene expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Genes rplJ, coding for ribosomal protein L10 of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been cloned on pUC plasmid. The resultant multicopy recombinant plasmids were detrimental for the growth of normal JM101 E. coli host cells and harmless for the mutant JF3029 host. This negative effect is the evidence for the ability of heterologous L10 proteins to regulate expression of rplJL genes in E. coli. Nucleotide sequence was determined completely for S. typhimurium rplJL' DNA portion and partially for rplJL' genes of K. pneumoniae. According to the nucleotide sequence data obtained three amino acid substitutions differ L10 proteins of S. typhimurium and E. coli and the long range, providing for the coupled translations of L10 and L7/L12 cistrons in E. coli mRNA is also valid for S. typhimurium and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of ptsH gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  
TI  - Distribution of alginate gene sequences in the Pseudomonas rRNA homology group I-Azomonas-Azotobacter lineage of superfamily B procaryotes.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from group I Pseudomonas species, Azotobacter vinelandii, Azomonas macrocytogens, Xanthomonas campestris, Serpens flexibilis, and three enteric bacteria was screened for sequences homologous to four Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate (alg) genes (algA, pmm, algD, and algR1). All the group I Pseudomonas species tested (including alginate producers and nonproducers) contained sequences homologous to all the P. aeruginosa alg genes used as probes, with the exception of P. stutzeri, which lacked algD. Azotobacter vinelandii also contained sequences homologous to all the alg gene probes tested, while Azomonas macrocytogenes DNA showed homology to all but algD. X. campestris contained sequences homologous to pmm and algR1 but not to algA or algD. The helical bacterium S. flexibilis showed homology to the algR1 gene, suggesting that an environmentally responsive regulatory gene similar to algR1 exists in S. flexibilis. Escherichia coli showed homology to the algD and algR1 genes, while Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to show homology with any of the P. aeruginosa alg genes. Since all the organisms tested are superfamily B procaryotes, these results suggest that within superfamily B, the alginate genes are distributed throughout the Pseudomonas group I-Azotobacter-Azomonas lineage, while only some alg genes have been retained in the Pseudomonas group V (Xanthomonas) and enteric lineages.
TI  - In vivo selection for transmissible drug resistance in Salmonella typhi during antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - We report the recovery of Salmonella typhi that acquired resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin subsequent to multiple antibiotic therapy. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates which were recovered from the same stool sample displayed identical resistance patterns. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that S. typhi and laboratory-derived transconjugants contained a high-molecular-weight plasmid present in the resistant intestinal bacteria.
TI  - [The immunomodulating properties of a glucomacropeptide from whey. I. The stimulation of resistance in mice].
AB  - The immunomodulating effect on mice of three products glucomacropeptides obtained from whey with different carbohydrate and peptide components has been studied. After the preliminary application of the preparations at several doses the protective effect in infections with Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae increases to different extent. At lower doses fraction 3 increases in vitro the mitogen-induced proliferation of the thymus cells. The phagocytosis of the polymorphonuclear cells on the 24th hour after application of the three preparations is activated. The influence of the structurally different fractions on the immunoprotective effect is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum of lignin-related pine cone extracts of Pinus parviflora Sieb. et Zucc.
AB  - Pine cones of Pinus parviflora Sieb., et Zucc, were extracted successively with 5% NaHCO3, 3% NH4OH, 1% NaOH and 4% NaOH, and the extracts were tested for ability to induce antimicrobial activity in mice infected with Staphylococcal aureus. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, or Salmonella enteritidis. These alkaline extracts were potent against the first 5 of these strains of microorganisms, and the activity was recovered mostly from their acid-precipitates at pH 5. After further fractionation on a Sephadex LH-60 column, the highest molecular weight fraction was most potent. Chemical structures in these bioactive fractions were assumed to be lignin-related structures, based on spectral data from UV, NMR and IR spectroscopy.
TI  - Preliminary studies of the effect of ozone on the bactericidal properties of complement.
AB  - The study analyzes the bactericidal influence of an ozonized blood serum on gram-negative bacilli. Considerable differences were observed concerning the effect which ozonized normal human serum has upon Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Salmonella strains. It was found that the impact may vary depending not only on the time of the exposure of serum to ozone, but also on the type of strain and the structure of the outer membrane of the bacteria. The Salmonella typhimurium strain of the Ra chemotype treated with the serum which was exposed to ozone showed higher susceptibility to the action of complement than the S. typhimurium strain of the S chemotype.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - "Orostim"--polymicrobial preparation for oral administration. I. "In vivo" determination of toxicity and of inborn resistance stimulation characteristic.
AB  - "Orostim" is a polymicrobial immunomodulator for oral administration, obtained from bacterial suspensions, disintegrated by ultrasonics and dried by atomization. The preparation was chemically characterized before and after atomization without presenting essential modifications. Orostim was not shown to be toxic in mice and rats by esophageal intubation, as long as 20 days. The animals presented normal evolution; hemoleukograms, serum proteins and alkaline phosphatase, in rats, did not present significant modifications in comparison with controls. Histopathologic examination of the organs, obtained from mice, treated for 20 days (liver, spleen, lung) did not emphasize modifications in comparison with controls. Circulating neutrophils phagocytosis in rabbits, orally treated with Orostim, was increased as compared to 0 time; serum complement values decreased compared to the initial ones for 0 time but turned to normal and reached even superior limits, 10 days after the treatment ending.
TI  - Comparison of sequences from the malB regions of Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter aerogenes with Escherichia coli K12: a potential new regulatory site in the interoperonic region.
AB  - The malE and malK genes from Salmonella typhimurium, and the malEFG operon and a  portion of malK from Enterobacter aerogenes were cloned and sequenced. Plasmid-borne malE genes from both species and the malF and malG genes from E. aerogenes were expressed normally in Escherichia coli, and their products function in maltose transport. This shows that the malB products from the three species are interchangeable, at least in the combinations tested. The general genetic organization of the malB region is conserved. Potential binding sites and distances between them are highly conserved in the regulatory intervals. An unexpected conserved region was detected, which we call the U box, and which could be another target for a regulatory protein. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of the U box in the regulatory region of the pulA-malX operon in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The intergenic region between malE and malF from S. typhimurium and E. aerogenes, contains inverted repeats similar to the palindromic units (PU or REP) found at the same location in E. coli. The predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins showed 90% or more identity in every pairwise comparison of species.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against flagellar antigen of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Two hybrid cell clones secreting monoclonal antibodies against flagellar antigen  isolated from Salmonella typhi, were produced and characterized. The antibodies bound specifically to the flagellar strain of S. typhi and did not show any reactivity with a flagellar S. typhi or with flagellar strains of S. dublin, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, S. typhimurium, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antibodies recognized a determinant present on a group of proteins migrating between 45 Kd and 60 Kd. These monoclonal antibodies would be useful reagents for clinical and epidemiological studies.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - Comparative study of three different dosing regimens of cefotaxime for treatment  of gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  - Thirty-one patients with Gram-negative bacteremia with organisms susceptible to cefotaxime (CTX) (MIC of 1 microgram/ml or less) were randomized to receive 2 g of CTX every 6, 8, or 12 hr. Five-hour susceptibility studies were performed on a bacterial pellet obtained from the patient's positive blood culture vial. Thus, patients were enrolled within hours after Gram-negative organisms were demonstrated in their blood cultures. All bacteremias were cleared although two patients had unsatisfactory responses to therapy. Trough serum bactericidal levels were 1:2 or greater in all patients. This study supports that CTX can be used at an 8- or 12-hr intervals in selected patients with Gram-negative bacteremia.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of oxaloacetate decarboxylase of Salmonella typhimurium, a sodium ion pump.
AB  - Anaerobic growth of Salmonella typhimurium on citrate is Na+-dependent and requires induction of the necessary enzymes during a 20-40 h lag phase. The citrate fermentation pathway involves citrate lyase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase. The decarboxylase is a membrane-bound, Na+-activated, biotin-containing enzyme that functions as a Na+ pump. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase was isolated by affinity chromatography of a Triton X-100 extract of the bacterial membranes on avidin-Sepharose. The enzyme consists of three subunits alpha, beta, gamma, with apparent molecular weights of 63,800, 34,500 and 10,600. The alpha-chain contains a covalently attached biotin group and binds to antibodies raised against the alpha-subunit of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The Na+ transport function was reconstituted by incorporation of the purified enzyme into proteoliposomes.
TI  - Detection with monoclonal antibody of Salmonella typhi antigen 9 in specimens from patients.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies were raised against Barber antigen (Ba) of Salmonella typhi 0901. Antibodies produced to antigen 9 of group D salmonellae were used in double- and triple-sandwich antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting antigen 9 in urine and plasma specimens from three groups of patients and 49 controls. The triple-antibody ELISA detected the antigen in urine samples from 11 of 18 (65%) patients with hemoculture-proven typhoid (group 1) and 12 of 39 (31%) patients with clinical features compatible with typhoid but whose hemocultures were negative (group 2). This ELISA was negative in three patients from whom Salmonella paratyphi A, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (group 3) were isolated by hemoculture and in all healthy controls. The double-antibody sandwich ELISA was positive in 41 and 15% of urine samples from patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and was negative with samples from two patients from group 3 and all controls. The sensitivity and specificity compared with those for healthy controls were 65 and 100%, respectively, for the triple-antibody ELISA. Although as little as 7.8 ng of homologous lipopolysaccharide could be detected, background in clinical specimens prevented accurate interpretation of the detection of this antigen in serum. Results were best with urine specimens.
TI  - Evolution of aminobenzoate synthases: nucleotide sequences of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes pabB.
AB  - p-Aminobenzoate synthase (PS) and anthranilate synthase (AS) are structurally related enzymes that catalyze similar reactions and produce similar products, para- and ortho-aminobenzoate (anthranilate). Each enzyme is composed of two non-identical subunits: a glutamine amidotransferase subunit (CoII) and a subunit that produces an aminobenzoate product (CoI). Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the Escherichia coli genes encoding each of the subunits suggest a common evolutionary origin for both subunits of the enzyme complexes. We report here the nucleotide sequences of the pabB genes that encode Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes PS CoI. Comparative sequence information suggests that pabB is encoded as the first gene in a multicistronic transcript. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of PS CoI genes indicates that the majority of sequence identity occurs in the C-terminal two-thirds of the proteins. Similarly, identities in an alignment of eight PS and AS CoI sequences are confined to the C-terminal segments of the proteins. Secondary-structure predictions for the nine sequences suggest considerable similarity in the folding of the C-terminal portions of the aminobenzoate synthases.
TI  - Immunization with rough mutants of Salmonella minnesota: initial studies in human subjects.
AB  - Vaccines prepared from unheated and boiled, acetone-precipitated Salmonella minnesota R595 (Re chemotype mutant) were administered subcutaneously to 122 healthy volunteers. Titers of antibody to Re lipopolysaccharide, the basal core structure of endotoxin, as measured by indirect hemagglutination, rose in a dose-responsive fashion after immunization. Febrile reactions, usually mild, occurred after 7% of injections with the highest doses (2.0 and 3.0 x 10(10) organisms), and mild local soreness and tenderness were noted after approximately one-third of injections. Passive immunization of mice with sera from immunized subjects demonstrated that protective activity against challenge with both heterologous, viable gram-negative bacilli and endotoxin developed. Although measuring serum protective activity, developing a serological assay that correlates with protective activity, and potential vaccine toxicity remain problems, immunization of humans with the Re mutant results in serum protective activity against endotoxin and viable bacilli and has the potential for clinical usefulness.
TI  - Immunization with rough mutants of Salmonella minnesota: protective activity of IgM and IgG antibody to the R595 (Re chemotype) mutant.
AB  - We evaluated the immunoglobulin class responsible for the protective activity in  serum obtained from humans and rabbits after immunization with the R595 (Re chemotype) mutant of Salmonella minnesota. Whole serum obtained before immunization and the IgG and IgM fractions failed to protect mice against lethal challenge with viable Klebsiella pneumoniae or Morganella morganii or with Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The protective activity of postimmunization serum resided solely in IgM antibody, whereas IgG antibody exhibited no protective activity. IgM antibody to the Re mutant was protective against bacterial challenge with both test strains of bacteria and S. typhi LPS. IgM antibody, at approximately the same concentration present in postimmunization serum, increased the LD50 of K. pneumoniae from less than 8.0 x 10(2) to greater than 2.0 x 10(4). These findings indicate that commercially prepared human IgG with high titers of antibody to antigens of the core portion of LPS would have little clinical utility.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime was 8 to 10 times more active than cefaclor and augmentin against isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, MIC90 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml. However, none of these three drugs was particularly active against isolates of more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Providencia and Achromobacter spp. The lowest MIC values for gram-negative bacilli were seen with ciprofloxacin, except for isolates of Acinetobacter, where cotrimoxazole was the most active of the five drugs studied. Augmentin and ciprofloxacin exhibited the lowest MICs for isolates of streptococci and corynebacteria. Although cefixime may be among the most active oral beta-lactam drugs, it does not appear to be useful for treatment of infections caused by more resistant gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Anaerobic metabolism of the L-rhamnose fermentation product 1,2-propanediol in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - When grown anaerobically on L-rhamnose, Salmonella typhimurium excreted 1,2-propanediol as a fermentation product. Upon exhaustion of the methyl pentose, 1,2-propanediol was recaptured and further metabolized, provided the culture was kept under anaerobic conditions. n-Propanol and propionate were found in the medium as end products of this process at concentrations one-half that of 1,2-propanediol. As in Klebsiella pneumoniae (T. Toraya, S. Honda, and S. Fukui, J. Bacteriol. 139:39-47, 1979), a diol dehydratase which transforms 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde and the enzymes involved in a dismutation that converts propionaldehyde to n-propanol and propionate were induced in S. typhimurium cultures able to transform 1,2-propanediol anaerobically.
TI  - Mutagenic activity of acrylamide in eukaryotic systems but not in bacteria.
AB  - The vinyl monomer acrylamide (AA) was studied for its activity in a range of genotoxicity tests, including the Salmonella/microsome test, the fluctuation test using Klebsiella pneumoniae, the test for gene mutations at the TK and HPRT loci in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, tests for chromosomal aberrations and SCEs in V79 Chinese hamster cells, the sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) and somatic mutation and recombination (SMART) assays in Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. AA showed genotoxic activity in most systems. The bacterial tests did not respond, in compliance with literature data; also in the Drosophila SLRL test, no significant increase in mutation rate was observed.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Distribution and diversity of hsd genes in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria.
AB  - We screened Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Shigella boydii, and many isolates of Escherichia coli for DNA sequences homologous to those encoding each of two unrelated type I restriction and modification systems (EcoK and EcoA). Both K- and A-related hsd genes were identified, but never both in the same strain. S. typhimurium encodes three restriction and modification systems, but its DNA hybridized only to the K-specific probe which we know to identify the StySB system. No homology to either probe was detected in the majority of E. coli strains, but in C. freundii, we identified homology to the A-specific probe. We cloned this region of the C. freundii genome and showed that it encoded a functional, A-related restriction system whose specificity differs from those of known type I enzymes. Sequences immediately flanking the hsd K genes of E. coli K-12 and the hsd A genes of E. coli 15T- were shown to be homologous, indicating similar or even identical positions in their respective chromosomes. E. coli C has no known restriction system, and the organization of its chromosome is consistent with deletion of the three hsd genes and their neighbor, mcrB.
TI  - [Influence of different types of experimental obesity on resistance of the mouse  to infection by Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae].
AB  - Resistance to infections inducing two types of immune response, humoral and cell-mediated, has been measured in mice after Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculation; the animals exhibited different kinds of obesity: genetic, ob/ob and db/db mutants, induced by fat diet or gold thioglucose (aurothioglucose) injection (determining obesity of central origin). Klebsiella infection was aggravated in all types of obesity. Salmonella infection was aggravated in genetically diabetic and dietary-obese mice. The two kinds of genetically obese mice show an important functional decrease in splenic lymphocytes. In contrast, aurothioglucose-obese mice were more resistant than controls.
TI  - [The use of UV rays for the disinfection of water. I. Microbiologic studies of drinking water].
AB  - As a physical disinfection method without chemicals required the ultraviolet irradiation was tested for disinfection of drinking water. The survival was measured as a function of exposure to radiation for S. enteritidis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, E. coli, K. pneumoniae und S. faecium. The bacteria were grown in trypton soya broth until they were well into the exponential phase. Two different UV-disinfection units were tested. Both consist of cylindrical shaped chambers with one low-pressure mercury-discharge lamp with their longitudinal axis parallel to the chambers. With 10(6) cfu/ml the experiments were done with three different rates of flow of 7,2 m3/h, 4,0 m3/h and 2,0 m3/h. The minimum exposures to radiation necessary to cause a 99.999% reduction were 10-86 mWs/cm2 depending on the test bacterium and on the UV-disinfection unit. The minimum doses ranged for S. enteritidis up to 13 mWs/cm2, for E. coli up to 21 mWs/cm2, for K. pneumoniae up to 39 mWs/cm2, for S. faecium up to 42 mWs/cm2, for E. cloacae up to 43 mWs/cm2, for C. freundii up to 72 mWs/cm2, and for S. marcescens up to 86 mWs/cm2.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding type 1 fimbrial subunits of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the subunits of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium type 1 fimbriae were determined. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the two subunits revealed domains in which the sequences were highly conserved. Both gene products possessed signal peptides, a fact consistent with the transport of the fimbrial subunit across the membrane, but these regions showed no amino acid homology between the two proteins. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequences of the processed fimbrial subunits were in good agreement with those obtained by purification of the fimbrial subunits.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide: association of cross-genus reactivity with lipid A specificity.
AB  - Somatic cell hybrids secreting monoclonal antibodies against the core-glycolipid  portion of enterobacterial endotoxin were derived from mice immunized with Escherichia coli J5 or Salmonella minnesota R595 heat-killed organisms or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Eight antibodies were selected for their ability to cross-react with several members of a panel of gram-negative bacterial antigens in a radioimmunoassay. This panel represented five genera and two families of organisms: E. coli O111:B4, E. coli O55:B5, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella minnesota, and Serratia marcescens. The binding sites for six of the antibodies were unequivocally localized within the lipid A moiety of the endotoxin molecule by using the radioimmunoassay on LPS and free lipid A. The anti-lipid A antibodies were further characterized for their ability to interact with LPS variants by using a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunostaining procedure. The monoclonal antibodies bound almost exclusively to the low-molecular-weight species of LPS on the polyacrylamide gel. These components corresponded to LPS isolated from rough strains of organisms (strains which lack O-specific carbohydrate). These results suggested that the cross-reactive component of antisera raised against rough mutants of gram-negative bacteria contain antibodies of lipid A specificity. Moreover, the determinant within the lipid A moiety of LPS may have been accessible to the monoclonal antibodies only in those endotoxin molecules on the outer membrane surface which lack the O-specific carbohydrate.
TI  - Characterization of genes encoding type 1 fimbriae of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - With a minicell system, the organization of genes encoding type 1 fimbriae of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens was determined. In all cases multiple gene products were necessary for the phenotypic expression of fimbriae; thus fimbrial expression in these strains is similar to that in Escherichia coli. The type 1 fimbrial subunit gene was detected by the ability of its product to react with specific antiserum. At least six genes were found to be involved in the expression of type 1 fimbriae by S. typhimurium, and at least four genes constituted the fimbrial gene cluster of K. pneumoniae. In the case of S. marcescens, a minimum of three detectable polypeptides was required for the production of fimbriae. Also, a gene probe consisting in part of nucleotide sequences from the E. coli fimbrial subunit gene hybridized to a discrete DNA fragment derived from the plasmid encoding K. pneumoniae fimbriae. Such a fragment was assumed to contain a gene encoding the structural component of the type 1 fimbriae. Each of the three cloned systems encoded a number of polypeptides which varied in size; thus, the organization and molecular weight of fimbrial accessory proteins of each genus were not identical.
TI  - Differences in adhesiveness among type 1 fimbriate strains of Enterobacteriaceae  revealed by an in vitro HEp2 cell adhesion model.
AB  - Ten type 1 fimbriate strains of Enterobacteriaceae were examined in an in vitro adhesion assay with HEp2 epithelial cells. The range of HEp2 cell adhesiveness, which was characteristic for each strain, was affected by motility, type 1 fimbriation and production of mannose sensitive haemagglutinin. Nevertheless, not all type 1 fimbriate strains adhered well in this model. The findings are discussed with regard to the possibility that different type 1 fimbriate enterobacteria, though all are mannose sensitive, recognize different mannose-containing receptors present or available on the surfaces of the HEp2 cells.
TI  - Neutralization and lipoprotein binding of lipopolysaccharides in tolerant rabbit  serum.
AB  - We examined the ability of sera drawn from rabbits made tolerant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O18 to inhibit heterologous LPS-induced gelation of Limulus lysate. Compared with a pool of pretolerant sera, a pool of tolerant sera from these rabbits neutralized 5.5-fold more LPS from Salmonella typhimurium, 4.9-fold more LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 10.0-fold more LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Because previous studies have found that LPS bound to lipoprotein is less toxic than unbound LPS, we also studied the binding of LPS lipoprotein fractions in the serum pools by using fractionation with a cesium chloride-equilibrium density gradient. Radiolabeled LPS from E. coli O113 bound much more rapidly to lipoprotein fractions in tolerant serum than in pretolerant serum (after 11 min of incubation, 66.1% vs. 16.5% binding, respectively).
TI  - Influence of Salmonella and other gram-negative bacteria on the survival of mice  infected with Schistosoma japonicum.
AB  
TI  - Microbial ribosomal vaccines.
AB  - Ribosomal vaccines have been prepared from several different bacterial, fungal, and protozoan microorganisms. Most of these preparations offer a higher degree of protection than do vaccines made from the homologous whole cells, but the mode of protection is controversial. All of the reported ribosomal vaccines are contaminated with cell surface determinants. Antisera raised to ribosomal preparations are directed to innate ribosomal components as well as to surface antigens. Several hypotheses exist for the reported protection from disease: the cell surface contaminants serve as the protective moieties; ribosomes act as potent adjuvants for contaminating cell surface determinants; ribosomes innately contain antigenic determinants that cross-react with cell surface antigens; recently translated cell surface polypeptides are still attached to the ribosomal RNA in the ribosomes; ribosomes migrate from the cytoplasm of the microbe to the periphery of the cell, and ribosomal antigens are exposed on the cell surface; or ribosomes contain messenger RNA and produce microbial cell surface polypeptides in immunized individuals. A short description of the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes is presented, followed by a discussion of the ability of various ribosomal vaccines to protect against infectious agents.
TI  - [Effect of the polysaccharide from Klebsiella pneumoniae K8 on the LD50 of Salmonella typhi].
AB  
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - Propanediol oxidoreductases of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Aspects of interspecies structural and regulatory differentiation.
AB  - The enzyme propanediol oxidoreductase, which converts the lactaldehyde formed in  the metabolism of fucose and rhamnose into propane-1,2-diol under anaerobic conditions, was investigated in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Structural analysis indicated that the enzymes of E. coli and K. pneumoniae have the same Mr and pI, whereas that of Salm. typhimurium also has the same Mr but a slightly different pI. One-dimensional peptide mapping showed identity between the E. coli and K. pneumoniae enzymes when digested with alpha-chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase or subtilisin. In the case of Salm. typhimurium, this held only for the subtilisin-digested enzymes, indicating that the hydrophobic regions were preserved to a considerable extent. Anaerobically, the three species induced an active propanediol oxidoreductase when grown on fucose or rhamnose. An inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was induced in Salm. typhimurium by either fucose or rhamnose under aerobic conditions, and this was activated once anaerobiosis was established. An inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was also induced in E. coli under aerobic conditions, but only by growth on fucose. The inactive enzyme was not induced by either of the sugars in K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Recombinant plasmid conferring proline overproduction and osmotic tolerance.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid carrying the proBA (pro-74) mutant allele which governs osmotic tolerance and proline overproduction was constructed by using the broad-host-range plasmid vector pQSR49. The physiological, biochemical, and genetic properties of strains carrying the pQSR49 derivatives pMJ101 and pMJ1, mutant and wild type, respectively, were investigated. pMJ101 conferred enhanced osmotolerance compared with strains carrying the wild type, pMJ1. These results are in contrast to those obtained previously with strains carrying recombinant plasmids based on pBR322 that failed to confer the osmotic tolerance phenotype. gamma-Glutamyl kinase (first step in proline biosynthesis) from strains carrying pMJ101 was 200-fold less sensitive to feedback inhibition than was the wild-type enzyme. As expected, the intracellular proline levels of strains carrying pMJ101 were more than an order of magnitude higher than those of the wild type. An analysis of copy number revealed that the pQSR49 constructs were present in the cell at a level six- to eightfold lower than those of the pBR322 recombinants, which may account for the difference in phenotype. We found that the genetic stability of the pQSR49 derivative in a variety of gram-negative bacteria was dependent on the insert orientation and the presence of foreign DNA on the plasmid. These factors may be significant in future studies aimed at expanding the osmotolerance phenotype to a broad range of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Evolution of glutamine amidotransferase genes. Nucleotide sequences of the pabA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - The amide group of glutamine is a source of nitrogen in the biosynthesis of a variety of compounds. These reactions are catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as glutamine amidotransferases; two of these, the glutamine amidotransferase subunits of p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase have been studied in detail and have been shown to be structurally and functionally related. In some micro-organisms, p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase share a common glutamine amidotransferase subunit. We report here the primary DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the p-aminobenzoate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens. A comparison of these glutamine amidotransferase sequences to the sequences of ten others, including some that function specifically in either the p-aminobenzoate synthase or anthranilate synthase complexes and some that are shared by both synthase complexes, has revealed several interesting features of the structure and organization of these genes, and has allowed us to speculate as to the evolutionary history of this family of enzymes. We propose a model for the evolution of the p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits in which the duplication and subsequent divergence of the genetic information encoding a shared glutamine amidotransferase subunit led to the evolution of two new pathway-specific enzymes.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effect of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (timentin) combination on bacteria resistant to ticarcillin].
AB  - Sixty-nine ticarcillin-resistant strains (57 Gram negative bacilli and 12 S. aureus) were tested: MICs and MBCs were determined for clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, and both agents combined using a liquid micromethod. MICs were compared to results of disk antibiotic sensitivity tests. While clavulanic acid exhibits little antibacterial activity, its action is synergistic with that of ticarcillin making 100% of Staphylococci and 84.2% of Gram negative bacilli susceptible. Among the Gram negative bacilli tested, distribution is as follows: E. coli (9/9), Klebsiella (10/14), Enterobacter (1/3), Serratia (8/8), Proteus, Providencia (8/8), Salmonella (2/2), Acinetobacter (4/4), and Pseudomonas (6/9). Although strong bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities are already achieved with 4 mg, the best results are obtained with timentin 8 mg.
TI  - Antigenic and molecular homology of the ferric enterobactin receptor protein of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The ferric enterobactin receptor protein (81 kDal) of Escherichia coli O111 was purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used to raise polyclonal antiserum in rabbits. This antiserum was used in conjunction with the immunoblot technique to examine the degree of antigenic homology of the ferric enterobactin receptor protein among 17 pathogenic and laboratory strains of E. coli. Both the molecular weight and the antigenic properties of the enterobactin receptor were highly conserved. However, the laboratory strain C and a pathogenic enteroinvasive strain, E. coli O164, were unusual in not producing the 81 kDal protein. The antiserum also recognized an 81 kDal protein from iron-restricted Salmonella typhimurium and an 83 kDal protein from iron-restricted Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Construction and comparison of recombinant plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The genes encoding type 1 fimbriae of Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens were cloned in Escherichia coli. All transformants possessing recombinant plasmids were shown to be fimbriate and demonstrated mannose-sensitive hemagglutinating activity. A comparison of the physical maps of these plasmids revealed little similarity among them, although plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae appeared similar with respect to restriction enzyme sites. The fimbrial gene cluster ranged in size from 5.5 to 9.0 kilobase pairs as determined by transposon mutagenesis. Plasmid-containing E. coli strains were shown to produce species-specific fimbrial antigens with little or no cross-reactivity between genera. Therefore, it was presumed that each plasmid contained the gene encoding the fimbrial subunit. Complementation was not detected between nonfimbriate insertion mutants of different species but was seen with mutants of the same species.
TI  - In vivo effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on proliferation of macrophage colony-forming cells in bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues.
AB  - Changes in the number of macrophage colony-forming cells in various tissues of mice injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella enteritidis were studied. The injection of LPS increased macrophage colony-forming cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and regional lymph node, although the same treatment caused the decrease of such cells in the bone marrow. This phenomenon was consistently observed when tested by various LPSs. The injection of LPS into mice which had been exposed to X-ray irradiation and reconstituted with syngeneic normal bone marrow cells decreased colony-forming cells in the spleen. The increase of macrophage colony-forming cells in the spleen seemed, therefore, not to be due to migration from the bone marrow. The injection of LPS appeared to shorten the lag time before the initiation of mitosis of colony-forming cells in the spleen but not in the bone marrow. No participation of serum factors in this phenomenon could be detected. It was suggested that there might be an essential difference between the responsiveness to LPS of macrophage colony-forming cells in the spleen and those of the bone marrow.
TI  - Mutagenicity of methyl bromide in a series of short-term tests.
AB  - Methyl bromide is commonly used as a soil fumigant in greenhouses. In the framework of a toxicological evaluation, it was tested for possible genotoxic properties in two bacterial test systems (the fluctuation test using Klebsiella pneumoniae and the plate test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98), two systems using mammalian cells in vitro (forward mutations at the TK and HPRT loci in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat-liver cells) and in the sex-linked recessive lethal test using Drosophila melanogaster. Methyl bromide was active in all tests except the DNA-repair assay. The results indicate a relatively low mutagenic efficiency of the compound, as expected from its alkylating properties.
TI  - Fermentation mechanism of fucose and rhamnose in Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - An equimolar amount of 1,2-propanediol was detected in the medium when Salmonella typhimurium or Klebsiella pneumoniae fermented L-fucose or L-rhamnose. These metabolic conditions induced a propanediol oxidoreductase that converted the lactaldehyde formed in the dissimilation of either sugar into the diol. The enzyme was further identified by cross-reaction with antibodies against Escherichia coli propanediol oxidoreductase. This indicates that L-fucose and L-rhamnose fermentation takes place in these species by 1,2-propanediol production and excretion.
TI  - Extension of bacteriophage lambda host range: selection, cloning, and characterization of a constitutive lambda receptor gene.
AB  - A set of plasmids has been constructed that carry a constitutive lamB gene (LamBc phenotype) from Escherichia coli and that confer functional phage lambda receptors to bacteria other than E. coli. This E. coli LamBc strain has been selected to escape both maltose-inducible and glucose-repressible control. Constitutivity results from an IS-3 insertion, carrying a mobile promoter, proximal to lamB. The LamBc DNA has been cloned into both broad and narrow host-range plasmids, and the resulting pTROY plasmids have been transferred to diverse bacteria. Both Salmonella typhimurium/pTROY and Klebsiella pneumoniae/pTROY strains efficiently adsorb phage lambda; Pseudomonas aeruginosa/pTROY strains do not. Introduction of a functional E. coli LamB protein into foreign bacterial will allow these bacteria carrying pTROY plasmids to be infected by phage lambda recombinant DNA libraries, phage lambda::Tn insertion mutagenesis vectors, and in vivo lambda-packaged cosmids.
TI  - [Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis of the cirrhotic patient, secondary to Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae].

TI  - Histidine operon control region of Klebsiella pneumoniae: analysis with an Escherichia coli promoter-probe plasmid vector.
AB  - The control region for the histidine operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned and analyzed with the Escherichia coli promoter-probe plasmid pPV33. A restriction fragment which contained the his control region was identified by its ability to activate the tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene on this vector. Expression of Tcr by bacteria containing the his promoter-active plasmid was found to be under the attenuation control of the his promoter. DNA sequence analysis of the his control region revealed a base sequence homology of approximately 86% of the analogous DNA sequences of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Most of the base alterations in the K. pneumoniae DNA sequence were found to reside in regions flanking the transcriptional and translational regulatory sites.
TI  - Carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  - The combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of D-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. The results showed that all five strains of Escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. Similar results were obtained with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the Salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the E. coli strains. The combining sites of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. The results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
TI  - Sequential acquisition of R-plasmids in vivo by Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium, resistant only to trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, was isolated from the faeces and blood of a chronic alcoholic patient in acute renal failure. The isolates harboured an 18 Md non-conjugative plasmid. He was dialysed peritoneally and treated with ampicillin; four days later there was no clinical improvement and his peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) had become infected. Salm. typhimurium was isolated from faeces and PDF. Both isolates were additionally resistant to ampicillin and contained two plasmids (55 Md and 18 Md). Therapy was changed to chloramphenicol and gentamicin was added to the PDF. Two weeks later Salm. typhimurium was again isolated from PDF and faeces. The PDF isolate was unchanged but 4% of the colonies isolated from this faecal specimen were resistant to chloramphenicol and had acquired an additional 62 Md plasmid. From all PDF and faecal specimens two different strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated which contained plasmids indistinguishable, on the basis of molecular weight and transferable resistance markers, from those acquired by Salm. typhimurium. The transferability of these plasmids in vitro to E. coli K12 and to the patient's initial Salm. typhimurium was studied and the results discussed.
TI  - Evidence for clustering of RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein genes in six species of Enterobacteria.
AB  - 32P-labelled DNA fragments from the E. coli beta operon were used as hybridisation probes for homologous DNA sequences in chromosomal digests of six species of Enterobacteria. In all species the hybridisation pattern suggested clustering of the genes comprising the beta operon.
TI  - Alternative prey: a mechanism for elimination of bacterial species by protozoa.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae  died readily after their addition to raw sewage, but they grew in sterilized sewage. The decline was not a result of abiotic stresses, and because the bacteria were able to survive in large numbers for at least 15 days in solutions containing no organic nutrients, it was not a result of competition. Toxin production, bacteriophages, and Bdellovibrio sp. did not cause the disappearance of the two bacterial species. A decline was also evident if the sewage was first passed through a 3-micron (pore size) filter or treated with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus nystatin, but protozoa developed under these conditions. Little or no decline occurred if the sewage was filtered and treated with the eucaryotic inhibitors before the addition of S. typhimurium or K. pneumoniae, and protozoa were not detected. S. typhimurium increased in abundance if cycloheximide, streptomycin, and erythromycin or large amounts of glucose were added to sewage. Tetrahymena thermophilus did not significantly reduce the population of S. typhimurium in buffer when the density of the bacterium was about 10(4)/ml. However, when more than 10(8) Enterobacter agglomerans cells per ml were added to the buffer, T. thermophilus reduced the abundance of E. agglomerans and S. typhimurium to 10(6) and 10/ml, respectively. The density of S. typhimurium was further decreased by a second increment of E. agglomerans cells. The disappearance of S. typhimurium and K. pneumoniae from sewage thus is the result of predation by protozoa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - In conjugational crosses, three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to newer types of cephalosporins. While Klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole and cefuroxime resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipients, the genetic analysis of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from Serratia strains to Proteus or Salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance determinant was also co-transferred. In subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin resistance determinants segregated in contrast to the relative stability of plasmids derived from Klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. From results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the scandium complex of enterochelin. Studies of the mechanism of action.
AB  - There is good evidence to show that ferric enterochelin is an essential growth factor for a number of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria exposed to the host iron binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin. Tests of nineteen complexes of enterochelin as potential antibacterial agents showed that only those containing either indium (In3+) or scandium (Sc3+) inhibited bacterial growth. In this study, further evidence is presented which demonstrates a competition between the Sc3+ and Fe3+ complexes. The uptake of both complexes is energy dependent and is also repressed in iron-replete cells. The Sc3+ complex accumulates within the cells at 20% of the rate of the Fe3+ complex. The main components of the ferric enterochelin transport system are required for the transport of the Sc3+ complex although some Sc3+ appears to enter the cell by another route. The accumulation, within the cell, of 14C-labelled enterochelin complexes depends on the growth medium. The relationship of the size of the metal ion to the biological activity of the complex is discussed and possible mechanisms of action of the Sc3+ complex are considered.
TI  - Carbohydrate specificity of the surface lectins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - A large number of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of  D-mannose were tested for their inhibitory activity on the agglutination of yeast cells or guinea pig erythrocytes by three D-mannose-specific enteric bacteria possessing type 1 fimbriae. With Escherichia coli 346, the best inhibitors found are the alpha glycosides of the branched oligosaccharides alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 6)]-alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-D-Manp and alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 6)]-alpha-D-Manp- (1 leads to 6)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3) ]-D-Manp and the trisaccharide alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-Manp-(1 leads to 4)-D-GlcNAc, all of which are 21-30 times more inhibitory than methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. The aromatic glycoside p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside was also a strong inhibitor (30 times more inhibitory than methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside), whereas the corresponding beta-D-glycoside was only a weak inhibitor (approximately as methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside). A nearly identical pattern of inhibitory activity was observed with the fimbriae. This suggests that the combining site of the E. coli fimbrial lectin is in the form of an extended pocket on the surface of the lectin corresponding to the size of a trisaccharide and fitting best the structure alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-Manp-(1 leads to 4)-D-GlcNAc. Since p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside is a strong inhibitor, the existence of a hydrophobic region in the combining site or close to it was assumed. The combining site of the Klebsiella pneumoniae fimbrial lectin is probably similar to that of E. coli, but that of the Salmonella typhimurium fimbrial lectin differs considerably. It appears that the combining sites of the three bacterial lectins tested exhibit preference for structures found in N-glycosylic oligomannoside units of mammalian cell surface glycoproteins.
TI  - The capacity of some nitro- and amino-heterocyclic sulfur compounds to induce base-pair substitutions.
AB  - The capacity of 27 heterocyclic sulfur compounds to induce base-pair substitutions was investigated with Klebsiella pneumoniae ur- pro- and Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as test organisms. Among the compounds tested, all sulfur compounds with nitro groups and some thiazoles with an amino group were mutagenic. Among the nitrothiazoles, the most potent mutagen was niridazole, followed by 2-acetamido-5-nitrothiazole, 2-bromo-5-nitrothiazole, N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)benzamide, and 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. Of the nitrothiophenes, 2-nitrothiophene was more mutagenic than 3-nitrothiophene and 2,4-dinitrothiophene. 4-Nitroisothiazole was also mutagenic. Of the aminothiazoles, 2-amino-5-bromothiazole and 2-amino-5-chlorothiazole were mutagenic to both test organisms. With 2-amino-5-(p-nitrophenylsulfonyl)thiazole, a mutagenic action was only found with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas 2-aminothiazole and 2-amino-4-methylthiazole were only mutagenic with Klebsiella pneumoniae. With the other 13 compounds, no mutagenic activity was observed. Of the coccidiostatics, 2-acetamido-5-nitrothiazole was also mutagenic on Escherichia coli K12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 but non-mutagenic on Salmonella typhimurium TA1530, TA1535, TA1537 and TA98, while 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole was mutagenic on Escherichia coli K12, Salmonella typhimurium TA1530, TA1535 and TA98, and non-mutagenic on strain TA1537 and on Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4.
TI  - Glycine betaine, an osmotic effector in Klebsiella pneumoniae and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Osmoregulation was examined in members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Exogenous glycine betaine at a concentration as low as 1 mM was found to stimulate the growth rate of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in media of inhibitory osmotic strength. The stimulation was shown to be independent of any specific solutes, electrolytes, or nonelectrolytes. Therefore, the stimulatory effect of glycine betaine was a consequence of high osmotic potential. This effect was found to be far greater than the proline effect previously observed in S. typhimurium. Whereas nitrogen fixation by K. pneumoniae is completely inhibited under conditions of osmotic stress, nitrogenase activity could be partially restored by the addition of exogenous glycine betaine to the culture medium. Furthermore, glycine betaine in combination with proline, especially proline produced internally at a high level because of regulatory mutations affecting proline biosynthesis, strongly stimulated nitrogen fixation activity during osmotic stress. Glycine betaine was accumulated by the cells, and the amount taken up was correlated with the osmolarity of the medium. These findings are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms by which glycine betaine might cause enhanced osmotolerance.
TI  - Plasmid pattern analysis of natural bacterial isolates and its epidemiological implication.
AB  - Natural isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. This data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae and P. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains of E. coli 0111 and S. typhimurium. Phenotypically similar isolates of S. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. The dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of S. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in addition to determining resistance properties. Plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large territory. Plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.
TI  - Are econazole, miconazole and clotrimazole mutagenic to bacteria?
AB  - The fungistatic drugs econazole, miconazole and clotrimazole were investigated as to mutagenic properties in the fluctuation test with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli K12 as test organisms and in the plate-incorporation test, with and without metabolic activation, with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. No mutagenic activity of the 3 compounds on these microorganisms was found.
TI  - Antibody response to the protein antigens of "Salmonella typhi" during typhoid infection and following vaccination with a live oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a.
AB  - Two protein antigens, named as S1Da and S1Db, common to many gram-negative bacteria, were prepared from an extract of Salmonella typhi cells. Antisera to S. typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone-treated cells of the corresponding bacterial species, all reacted against S1Da and S1Db as shown both by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Forty nine (98%) of the 50 tested sera obtained from typhoid patients while only 4 (8%) of the 50 sera obtained from febrile non-typhoid patients showed antibodies to S1Da and S1Db with ELISA titres above 1.000. S1Da and S1Db were then tested against 80 sera collected from 24 volunteers who had received a live typhoid vaccine Ty21a. Those vaccinees, who had antibodies to the LPS antigens of S. typhi following Ty21a vaccination, also developed antibodies to both the S1Da and S1Db antigens. Antigenically, S1Da and S1Db were different from each other and from the LPS antigens of S. typhi. S1Da and S1Db were basically protein in nature, the reactivity of these antigens against a positive control antiserum was destroyed by pronase, i.e., the addition of pronase after coating the MICROELISA plates with S1Da or S1Db reduced the ELISA titre to a minimum. Treatment with pronase, however, did not affect the ELISA titre when plates coated with the LPS antigens of S. typhi were used as the solid-phase antigen.
TI  - The transfer RNA of certain Enterobacteriacae contain 2-methylthiozeatin riboside (ms2io6A) an isopentenyl adenosine derivative.
AB  - Isopentenyl adenosine derivatives are always located adjacent to the 3' end of the anticodon in transfer RNA and have been implicated in certain biological functions. In the enteric bacterium, E. coli, the derivative is ms2i6A whereas in some plant associated bacteria the derivative is the hydroxylated form, ms2io6A. Anti-i6A immunoadsorbent chromatography has been employed to detect isopentenyl adenosine compounds. In the present study we show that the transfer RNA of three species of enteric bacteria, S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens contains both ms2io6A and ms2i6A. Under the growth conditions utilized the ms2io6A is predominant. The presence of ms2io6A in Enterobacteriacae is particularly noteworthy since in previous work it has been found only in plant-associated species of bacteria.
TI  - Fate in model ecosystems of microbial species of potential use in genetic engineering.
AB  - The changes in populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium meliloti, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured after their introduction into samples of sewage, lake water, and soil. Enumeration of small populations was possible because the strains used were resistant to antibiotics in concentrations and combinations such that few species native to these ecosystems were able to grow on agar containing the inhibitors. Fewer than 2 cells per ml of sewage or lake water and 25 cells per g of soil could be detected. A. tumefaciens and R. meliloti persisted in significant numbers with little decline, but S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, S. typhimurium, S. cerevisiae, and vegetative cells of B. subtilis failed to survive in samples of sewage and lake water. In sterile sewage, however, K. pneumoniae, B. subtilis, S. typhimurium, A. tumefaciens, and R. meliloti grew; S. cerevisiae populations were maintained at the levels used for inoculation; and S. aureus died rapidly. In sterile lake water, the population of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae and the number of vegetative cells of B. subtilis declined rapidly, R. meliloti grew, and the other species maintained significant numbers with little or a slow decline. The populations of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. tumefaciens, B. subtilis, and S. typhimurium declined in soil, but the first four species grew in sterile soil. It is suggested that some species persist in environments in which they are not indigenous because they tolerate abiotic stresses, do not lose viability readily when starved, and coexist with antagonists. The species that fails to survive need only be affected by one of these factors.
TI  - Plasmids and transposons acquired by Salmonella typhi in man.

TI  - Primary structure of the chromosomal origins (oriC) of Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae: comparisons and evolutionary relationships.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae  DNA replication origins (oriC) were determined and compared with those of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Four interrelated, 9-base-pair repeats were identified from the conserved regions within the minimal origin. Evolutionary rates calculated from the minimal origin sequences yielded a quantitative phylogenic tree which agreed with the taxonomic classification of these genera.
TI  - Common evolutionary origin of chromosomal beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteria.
AB  - A 32P-labeled fragment of DNA, encoding the major part of the chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase gene of Escherichia coli K-12, was used as a hybridization probe for homologous DNA sequences in colonies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and different enterobacterial species. The ampC probe detected the presence of homologous DNA sequences in clinical isolates of E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. No hybridization was found with N. gonorrhoeae colonies. In Southern blotting experiments the ampC probe hybridized to chromosomal DNA fragments of the same size in all enterobacterial species tested. However, the degree of hybridization differed with DNA from different species. DNA from the Shigella species strongly hybridized to the ampC probe. Furthermore, antibodies raised against purified E. coli K-12 ampC beta-lactamase precipitated beta-lactamases from the Shigella species, suggesting extensive sequence similarities between the ampC genes of these genera. The production of chromosomal beta-lactamase in S. sonnei increased with increasing growth rate similar to E. coli K-12. This growth rate response was abolished in two beta-lactamase-hyperproducing S. sonnei mutants, which thus seem similar to E. coli K-12 attenuator mutants. We propose that both the structure and regulation of the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes are very similar in E. coli and in S. sonnei.

AB  
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  - The adherence of staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3H-thymidine to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. Adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. Enterobacteriaceae adhered to Dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. The addition of velour to the Dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. In contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. The adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. However, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.
TI  - Chromosome transfer and R-prime formation by an RP4::mini-Mu derivative in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  
TI  - Seroepidemiological studies with Campylobacter fetus.
AB  - 324 sera from unselected male and 581 sera from female patients as well as 268 sera from prostitutes were studied for antibodies against Campylobacter fetus using the complement fixation test. Antigen was Campylobacter fetus subspecies intestinalis. 3.9% of the sera showed low but relevant antibody titers. Statistically significant differences don't exist between the three population investigated. Serological cross reactions could not be observed using Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O119 and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antigenic relationship however was observed with the subspecies jejuni and fetus.
TI  - The mutagenic action of aliphatic epoxides.
AB  - The mutagenic action of 45 epoxides was investigates in Luria and Delbruck's fluctuation test with Klebsiella pneumoniae as test organism. In this test, 36 of the 45 epoxides appeared to be mutagenic. The mutagenicity of 1,2-epoxides decreased with increasing length of the carbon chain. The mutagenic activity of compounds with a non-terminal epoxide group appeared to be less than that of substances with a terminal one. Generally 1,2-epoxide compounds with electronegative groups were more mutagenic than 1,2-epoxypropane. Of the diepoxides, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane appeared to be more mutagenic than 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane, while the ring compounds 1,2,5,6-diepoxycyclooctane was hardly mutagenic. The ring compound 4-vinylcyclohexenedioxide, used in electron microscopy that the antibiotic fosfomycin is among the more potent mutagenic substances investigated in this study.
TI  - Iron-related modification of bacterial transfer RNA.
AB  - Transfer RNAs isolated from E. coli grown in media where ferric iron is not freely available show well characterized chromatographic changes due to the absence of the methylthio moiety of ms2i6A. The altered tRNA molecules include tRNA trp tRNA tyr, tRNA phe and two minor tRNA ser species. It has been suggested that methylthiolation of tRNA affects its function in regulation. We now show iron-related changes in tRNA trp from S. typhimurium, Ps. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. tRNA trp from S. typhimurium contains ms2i6A and it seems probable that the availability of iron affects the synthesis of ms2i6A-tRNA trp from i6A-tRNA trp in this organism. An iron-related methylthiolating system may also be operative in K. pneumoniae. S. marcescens tRNA trp, however was not affected by the availability of iron. Neither ms2i6A nor i6A was found in S. marcescens tRNA, although an, as yet unidentified, hydrophobic nucleoside was present.
TI  - Phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed Salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  - In the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living Salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. This phenomenon was observed whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. The different response to living and killed bacteria was also found with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, but not with Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. The experimental results obtained with motility mutants of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.
TI  - Coregulation of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) transhydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities in enteric bacteria during nitrogen limitation.
AB  - The relationship between oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [NAD(P)+] transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1) and NAD(P)+ glutamate dehydrogenase in several enteric bacteria which differ slightly in their regulation of nitrogen metabolism was studied. Escherichia coli strain K-12 was grown on glucose and various concentrations of NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. In the range of 0.5 to 20 mM NH4Cl, the energy-independent transhydrogenase increased two to threefold. Comparable changes occurred in NAD(P)+-linked glutamate dehydrogenase. NH4Cl concentrations of 20 to 60 mM resulted in relatively constant specific activities for both enzymes. Higher exogenous NH4Cl, however, led to a decline in both activities. Isocitrate dehydrogenase, another potential source of cellular NADPH, was insensitive to NH4Cl limitation. Similar studies in the presence of glutamate and different exogenous NH4Cl concentrations again showed concerted effects on both enzymes. Growth on glutamate as the sole nitrogen source led to severe repression of both transhydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. In Salmonella typhimurium, both enzymes were unaffected by limiting NH4Cl or growth on glutamate as the sole nitrogen source. Both were, however, repressed by growth on aspartate, a potential source of cellular glutamate. Coordinate changes in glutamate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase were also evident in Klebsiella aerogenes, particularly under conditions in which glutamate dehydrogenase was regulated inversely to glutamate synthetase. Coordinate changes in glutamate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase in enteric bacteria are discussed in terms of the possible involvement of the latter enzyme as a direct source of NADPH in the ammonia assimilation system.
TI  - On the mutagenicity of nitroimidazoles.
AB  - Regarding mutagenicity, metronidazole is one of the best-investigated compounds of the nitroimidazoles. This drug is mutagenic on bacteria, especially if base-pair tester strains are used and bacterial nitroreductases are present. The serum levels attained in man after intake of this drug are sufficient to cause mutations in bacteria. Furthermore, interaction with and binding to DNA occurs under anaerobic conditions and sometimes DNA breaks are observed. However, metronidazole does not show mutagenic activity in mammalian cells in vitro; the micronucleus test is negative and chromosome aberrations are only found under anaerobic conditions. With microbial systems the mutagenicity of 47 nitroimidazoles has been investigated. Only 4 compounds were always negative in the applied test systems. Because with base-pair tester strains mutagenicity was assessed, this class of compounds should be regarded as a base-pair mutagen. In fungi, some compounds (e.g. ZK 26173 and azathioprine) are potent mutagens, whilst with most investigated nitroimidazoles only a weak or no mutagenic activity could be detected. Somewhat similar observations have been made in tests with Drosophila melanogaster, a test for gene mutations in mammalian cells, the micronucleus test, cytogenic tests and the dominant lethal test. The reduction products of metronidazole, misonidazole and 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinylimidazole, cause DNA damage if the nitro group is reduced in the presence of DNA. Reduction products are formed by microbes in the gut or by mammalian cells under anaerobic conditions. No teratological effect due to metronidazole or most other nitroimidazoles has been observed. Metronidazole is carcinogenic in mice and rats, and dimetridazole in rats. Up to the present, no carcinogenic effects have been observed in man. Azathioprine is probably carcinogenic for man. It is unlikely that the therapeutic applications of the presently used nitroimidazoles, except for azathioprine, will cause an increase in the tumor incidence in man or will cause other genotoxic effects, although such effects cannot be excluded with certainty.
TI  - Comparison of the nucleoside sequence of trpA and sequences immediately beyond the trp operon of Klebsiella aerogenes. Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of trpA of Klebsiella aerogenes is presented and compared with the trpA sequences of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The majority of the approximately 200 differences between each pair of trpA's are single nucleotide pair changes that do not alter the amino acid sequence. Codon usage conforms to the general patterns revealed by examination of other prokaryotic gene sequences. However, codon usage in K. aerogenes trpA reflects the high G+C content of the genome of this organism. The DNA sequences just beyond trpA, the presumed transcription termination region, are also compared for the three species. Perusal of these sequences indicates that the secondary structure of the transcript segment just beyond trpA has been preserved, while the primary sequence has diverged appreciably.
TI  - Transfer of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae genes in E. coli K12 by mini-muduction.
AB  - Using Mu/mini-Mu mixed lysates prepared by induction of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae lysogenic for Mucts62 or the Mu-P1 hybrid, MPh1, and mini-Mu, Mu18A-1, we were able to transfer Arg and His genes from Klebsiella and Salmonella into E. coli K12.
TI  - Physical maps of Klebsiella aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium hut genes.
AB  - The recognition sites for several restriction endonucleases were mapped within deoxyribonucleic acid coding for histidine utilization (hut) genes of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes. Deoxyribonucleic acid fragments containing the two hut promoters were identified by ribonucleic acid polymerase binding.
TI  - [Experimental infection by "Salmonella typhi-murium": protective role of homologous ribosomal extracts in calves (author's transl)].
AB  - Eleven calves, 6 months old, vaccinated or not, have been infected experimentally with 10(7) Salmonella typhi-murium, administered by oral route. The control calves had a serious illness, characterized by a severe diarrhoea, hepatic and renal symptoms and a heavy infestation of the main organs. The other five calves, which were orally and subcutaneously vaccinated with ribosomal extracts of S. typhi-murium and S. dublin showed only a moderate alteration of their health while biochemical disorders at the level of liver and kidneys disappeared. However, salmonella were found in mesenteric lymph nodes, but in much lower amounts than in controls.
TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - Studies on the enzymatic synthesis of enterochelin in Escherichia coli K-12, Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Physical association of enterochelin synthetase components in vitro.
AB  - Further evidence is presented in support of the proposal made previously (Greenwood, K.T. and Luke, R.K.J. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 454, 285-297) that components of the Escherichia coli enterochelin synthetase system physicaloly associate to form enzyme complexes. Evidence for the existence of three enzyme complexes, designated in order of increasing stability G-D < F-D < F-D-G, has been obtained following gel filtration and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. Persistence of the F-D and G-D complexes during chromatography appears to depend on the flow rate of the column. On the basis of complementation with appropriate ent mutants of E. coli, activities corresponding to those of the D, E, F and G components of enterochelin synthetase in E. coli have been detected in cell-extracts of both Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes) strains. These are designated D', E', F' and G' activities. Components E' and G' are eluted from Sephadex G-100 in similar fashion to their E. coli counterparts. Peaks of F' and D' activities however, are eluted together at a position corresponding to that of the E. coli F component. We suggest that in S. typhimurium and K. pneumoniae, either a single polypeptide combines the functions of the E. coli F and D components, or that separate F' and D' components form a stable complex and that activity of uncomplexed D' and component was not detected under the conditions used during chromatography and assay.
TI  - The mutagenic action of quindoxin, carbadox, olaquindox and some other N-oxides on bacteria and yeast.
AB  - The mutagenic action of 3 coccidiostatic chinoxaline-N-oxide derivatives, quindoxin, carbadox and olaquindox, was investigated by Luria and Delbruck's fluctuation test, with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli K12 as test organisms. These compounds were mutagenic at very low concentrations (2 X 10(-5)--500 X 10(-5) mmole/l). In the Ames test they showed a mutagenic action without metabolic activation with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 at concentrations of 0.001-0.1 mmole/l in the top agar. Hence, these compounds cause both base-pair substitutions and frame-shift mutations. When Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 was cultivated in the presence of the compounds, an increase in the mitotic gene conversions was observed. Certain other N-oxides also showed a mutagenic action in the fluctuation test. With Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide was mutagenic at a concentration of 0.005 mmole/l, quinoline 1-oxide at 10 mmole/l and benzofuroxan at 0.01 mmole/l. In this test no mutagenic action was found with 4-nitropyridine 1-oxide, pyridine 1-oxide or 4-picoline 1-oxide. With Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, benzofuroxan and 4-nitropyridine 1-oxide were mutagenic, whereas quinoline 1-oxide, pyridine 1-oxide and 4-picoline 1-oxide were not. In contrast, with the fluctuation test, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide appeared to be more mutagenic than quindoxin, carbadox and olaquindox in the plate incorporation test.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.

TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.

TI  - On the mutagenic action of some enzyme immunoassay substrates.
AB  - The mutagenic action of six compounds used in ELISA, EMIT and EIA assays, was investigated by means of the fluctuation test, with Klebsiella pneumoniae as a test organism, and the Ames' plate incorporation test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100 and TA 1537. It appears that 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulphonic acid (6)) or ABTS exerts mutagenic action on Klebsiella pneumoniae at a concentration of 11 g/l, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 at a top agar concentration of 0.1 g/l, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 at 0.2 g/l and on Salmonella typhimurium TA 1537 at 10 g/l. With umbelliferone, mutagenic action was found only with Klebsiella pneumoniae at a concentration of 0.8 g/l or higher. With o-phenylenediamine, strong mutagenic activity was found only with strain TA 98 and metabolic activation at a top agar concentration of 0.001 g/l. With 5-aminosalicylic acid, beta-methylumbelliferone and p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, no mutagenic action was observed.

TI  - Subtraction serum bactericidal assay: a method for estimating in vivo effects of  antibiotic combinations.
AB  - The subtraction serum bactericidal assay has been developed to assess the effects of the individual components of antibiotic combinations in serum specimens from patients with serious bacterial infection. The technique can be performed easily with conventional microtiter technology, and the results compare favorably with those obtained by conventional in vitro determinations of the additive and synergistic activity of fixed antibiotic combinations against various Enterobacteriaceae. Three combinations of gentamicin and ampicillin were used, and synergistic or additive activity was demonstrated against each of the 11 clinical isolates tested, but only with one or two of the antibiotic combinations. This finding suggests the clinical importance of a test that can determine the effects of the actual concentrations of individual antibiotics that are achieved in patients with serious infections that are being treated with antibiotic combinations.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefamandole (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of cefamandole (CMD). The results are as follows: The sensitivity was measured by plate dilution method on 26 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and 14 strains of Salmonella typhimurium isolated from patients. The distribution of sensitivity of S. aureus was 0.39 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 1.56 micrograms/ml. The distribution of sensitivity of E. coli was 0.78 approximately greater than 100 micrograms/ml, and K. pneumoniae, 1.56 approximately greater than 100 micrograms/ml. The distribution of sensitivity of Salmonella typhimurium was 6.25 approximately greater than 100 micrograms/ml and its peak was 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD were given intravenously for 30 and 60 minutes at a single dose of 25 mg/kg body weight to 6 children. The serum mean levels of CMD were 105.3 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 15.1 micrograms/ml at 1.5 hours, 1.6 micrograms/ml at 2.5 hours after drip infusion for 30 minutes, respectively, and 34.7, 5.2, 0.6 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 3 hours after drip infusion for 60 minutes, respectively. And the serum level at 4 hours after administration was not detected. The mean urinary excretion rates were 73.3% in the drip infusion for 30 minutes and 60.7% in its for 60 minutes, up to 8 hours after administration. Half life was 26 minutes. CMD was effective in 18 of 21 cases of bacterial infections. No side effects were observed except for 2 cases with elevation of serum transaminase.
TI  - Salmonella phage glycanases: substrate specificity of the phage P22 endo-rhamnosidase.
AB  - Interaction between phage P22 and phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides from sensitive Salmonella bacteria belonging to serogroups A, B and Di results in hydrolysis of the alpha-L-rhamnosyl linkages within the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O-antigenic polysaccharide chain. These O-antigens have identical structures except for the nature of the 3,6-dideoxy-hexosyl group linked to O-3 of the D-mannosyl residue. Removal of the dideoxysugar, or periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction of the L-rhamnosyl residue made the O chain resistant to the endo-rhamnosidase. Substitution of the D-galactosyl residue at O-4, but not at O-6, with an alpha-D-glucosyl group was compatible with hydrolysis. A number of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri lipo- or capsular polysaccharides containing chain L-rhamnosyl residues were tested but none was sensitive to the P22 endo-rhamnosidase. The substrate specificity of the endo-rhamnosidase parallels the lytic specificity of the phage which suggests that the initial step in phage P22 infection is a P22 tail enzyme O-antigen substrate interaction. The main product of the hydrolysate was octa-, dodeca- and hexadecasaccharides. Treatment of phage FO resistant smooth strains of S. typhimurium with P22 tails removed O polysaccharide chains and made previously 'hidden' FO receptors accessible to the phage.
TI  - Experimental Klebsiella and Salmonella infection in neonatal swine.
AB  - Twenty colostrum-fed piglets from three sows were separated from the sows 24 hours after birth and were randomly divided into five groups of four piglets each. Every piglet in each of four test groups was orally inoculated with about 10(10) colony forming units of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella choleraesuis var Kunzendorf or one of two isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. One group served as uninoculated controls. Piglets infected with K. pneumoniae developed severe diarrhea beginning about 12 hours after inoculation. They became dehydrated and weak but continued to drink. There were no morphological alterations in intestinal mucosa when piglets were killed and necropsied 48 or 72 hours after inoculation. Klebseilla pneumoniae was isolated from intestine and feces but not from liver or spleen. Piglets inoculated with S. choleraesuis became lethargic and disinterested in food by 24 hours after inoculation. Diarrhea developed by 48 hours after inoculation. Lesions at necropsy 60 or 72 hours postinoculation were subcutaneous edema, mesenteric lymphadenitis, diffuse intestinal superficial mucosal necrosis with villous atrophy, and focal deep ulceration in the ileum. Salmonella choleraesuis was isolated from all segments of intestine and from feces, liver and spleen. Piglets inoculated with S. typhimurium developed a relatively mild diarrheal disease with lesions similar to those with S. choleraesuis infection but less severe. The inoculated organism was recovered from all areas of intestine and from feces, liver and spleen. Serum from infected and control piglets had high (greater than 1:256) agglutinating titres against S. typhimurium but low titres (0 to 1:8) against S. choleraesuis. The agglutinins were assumed to originate from colostral antibodies.
TI  - The mutagenic action of nitroimidazoles. IV. A comparison of the mutagenic action of several nitroimidazoles and some imidazoles.
AB  - The mutagenic action of 51 imidazoles was investigated. The fluctuation test of Luria and Delbruck was used, with Klebsiella pneumoniae as test organism. 8 compounds, including 5 with a weak mutagenic action in the fluctuation test, were also investigated by the Ames test in which Salmonella typhimurium TA100 was used. Of the 51 imidazoles examined, 33 were nitroimidazoles. 31 of the latter appeared to be mutagenic, whereas out of the 18 other imidazoles without a nitro group only 2 were mutagenic. Several of the substances tested for mutagenicity showed an antimicrobial activity. No direct relationship between antimicrobial action, growth inhibition and mutagenicity was established. With methyl-nitroimidazoles a relationship was found between the chemical structure and mutagenic action. However, when the nitroimidazoles had a more complex chemical structure, a relationship between this structure and mutagenicity could not be established.
TI  - Interferon and cytotoxic factor (cytotoxin) released in the blood of mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. II. Influence of time after BCG inoculation on production of interferon and cytotoxin by capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae or by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and on hyperreactivity to their lethal effects.
AB  - The time course of the occurrence of hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin  responses to the active substance (neutral fraction) of the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae (neutral CPS-K) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and of the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects was followed after infection with BCG in SMA and ICR strains of mice. The duration of these hyperreactivities of BCG-infected mice depended on the inoculum doses of BCG. The time patterns of the hyperreactivity to the lethal effects of neutral CPS-K and LPS were similar in both strains of mice, although the maximum toxicity of LPS by the intraperitoneal route in BCG-infected mice on a weight basis was stronger than that of neutral CPS-K. Irrespective of inducer and mouse strain, the time pattern of the hyperreactivity to produce cytotoxin was similar to that of the hyperreactivity to produce interferon. The patterns for these phenomena when neutral CPS-K was used as an inducer were also similar to those when LPS was used. In ICR mice the hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin responses to either neutral CPS-K or LPS decayed significantly earlier than the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects, whereas in SMA mice the occurrence of both types of hyperreactivities seemed to be associated. Therefore, it is suggested that the mechanism for the hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin responses to neutral CPS-K or LPS in BCG-infected mice is not necessarily the same as that for the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects.
TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. III. Further study of its effects on interactions between peritoneal leukocytes and virulent Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - The mechanism for the infection-promoting effect of the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPS-K) was investigated using the experimental system in which mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a virulent strain of Salmonella enteritidis immediately after i.p. injection of CPS-K. In the peritoneal phagocytes of CPS-K-untreated control mice, approximately 70, 3, and 10% of phagocytized bacteria survived 6, 12, and 24 hr after challenge, respectively, when calculated from the ratio of the number of cell-associated viable bacteria, which was estimated by direct plate count, to the number of phagocytized bacteria, which was estimated by microscopic observation of stained smears. In contrast, almost all of the phagocytized bacteria were viable throughout the experimental period in mice treated with CPS-K. The electron microscopical findings of the phagocytes obtained 12 hr after challenge showed that in the cells of mice treated with CPS-K almost all of the phagocytized bacteria were morphologically intact, with some of them in the stages of cell division, whereas in those of untreated control mice, almost all of the phagocytized bacteria underwent digestive changes. When the reaction product of acid phosphatase was examined by electron microscopy in the phagocytes obtained 12 hr after challenge, the enzyme activity in the phagosomes was very low in mice treated with CPS-K in comparison with that in untreated control mice. Enzyme assays of the lysosomal and extralysosomal fractions of peritoneal cells obtained at various times after challenge also showed that release of acid phosphatase from the lysosomal fraction to the extralysosomal fraction after bacterial challenge was inhibited in peritoneal cells of mice treated with CPS-K.
TI  - Interferon and cytotoxic factor (cytotoxin) released in the blood of mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. I. Enhanced production of interferon and appearance of cytotoxin stimulated by capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Interferon production stimulated by the active substance (neutral fraction) of the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae (neutral CPS-K) in BCG-infected mice was compared with that by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Prior infection with BCG increased the responsiveness of mice to the lethal effect of neutral CPS-K as well as to that of LPS. Associated with this, BCG-infected mice showed a markedly enhanced ability to produce interferon after stimulation not only by LPS but also by neutral CPS-K. In addition, a cytotoxic factor (cytotoxin) was found to be released in the serum of BCG-infected mice after injection of these inducers. The kinetics of production of interferon and cytotoxin stimulated by neutral CPS-K were very similar to those stimulated by LPS. The time pattern of cytotoxin production was not in parallel with that of interferon production. Interferon reached a peak 2 hr and cytotoxin 3 hr after injection with these inducers. Interferon and cytotoxin produced by neutral CPS-K showed essentially the same stabilities to heating at 56 C and to treatment at pH 2 respectively as those produced by LPS. Interferon was inactivated by heating at 56 C more rapidly than cytotoxin. Cytotoxin was inactivated by treatment at pH 2 for 24 hr, whereas interferon activity was well preserved after this treatment. These results suggest that both activities are the result of different substances.
TI  - Thermosensitive H1 plasmids determining citrate utilization.
AB  - Twelve thermosensitive H1 plasmids from strains of Salmonella typhi that had caused outbreaks of chloramphenicol-resistant typhoid fever in Vietnam, Thailand and India mediated citrate utilization (Cit+) in a prototrophic Escherichia coli K12 strain but not in the S. typhi strains from which they were derived. Four H1 plasmids from a similar outbreak in Mexico differed from the Far Eastern plasmids in not mediating citrate utlization but in mediating mercury resistance. H1 plasmids resembling the Far Eastern and the Mexican plasmids in regard to citrate utilization and mercury resistance were found in sewage in Britain. Citrate utilization was transferred to eight pathogenic strains of E. coli and to one strain each of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei. Cultures of Cit+ bacteria grew more rapidly in citrate media at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Plasmid mutants that were more efficient at utilizing citrate were present in all such cultures--they grew equally well or better at 37 degrees C than at 28 degrees C. None of 222 strains of E. coli or Shigella that contained a variety of different plasmids were able to utilize citrate. This property was not transferred to the prototrophic E. coli K12 strain from Citrobacter (3 strains), Salmonella (39 strains), Proteus (44 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (33 strains) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (44 strains).
TI  - Genetic mapping of tyramine oxidase and arylsulfatase genes and their regulation  in intergeneric hybrids of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The genes for arylsulfatase (atsA) and tyramine oxidase (tynA) have been mapped in Klebsiella aerogenes by P1 transduction. They are linked to gdhD and trp in the order atsA-tynA-gdhD-trp-pyrF. Complementation analysis using F' episomes from Escherichia coli suggested an analogous location of these genes in E. coli, although arylsulfatase activity was not detected in E. coli. P1 phage and F' episomes were used to create intergeneric hybrid strains of enteric bacteria by transfer of the ats and tyn genes between K. aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. Intergeneric transduction of the tynK gene from K. aerogenes to an E. coli restrictionless strain was one to two orders less frequent than that of the leuK gene. The tyramine oxidase of E. coli and S. typhimurium in regulatory activity resemble very closely the enzyme of K. aerogenes. The atsE gene from E. coli was expressed, and latent arylsulfatase protein was formed in K. aerogenes and S typhimurium. The results of tyramine oxidase and arylsulfatase synthesis in intergeneric hybrids of enteric bacteria suggest that the system for regulation of enzyme synthesis is conserved more than the structure or function of enzyme protein during evolution.
TI  - Experimental gram-negative bacterial sepsis: reevaluation of the ability of rough mutant antisera to protect mice.

TI  - Heterologous transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA: and improved system.
AB  - A highly efficient and much more reproducible system for the heterologous transfection of several kinds of Gram-negative bacterial spheroplasts with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA was established. By mild washing of the speroplasts, the efficiency of transfection of all non-host heterologous bacterial species tested increased one or more orders of magnitude in producing the progeny phages and/or the infectious intermediates. Using the improved heterologous transfection systems, it has become clearer that a strong suppression system operates on the processes of phiX174 progeny phage production and not on those of phiX174 dougle-stranded replicative form DNA synthesis in the heterologous bacterial cells. Similar stimulatory effects of this washing procedure were observed in the homologous transfection. With this improved assay system, even less than 100 molecules of phage phiX174 DNA can be detected and the number of molecules can be determined with accuracy.
TI  - Biologic properties of bacterial lipopolysaccharides treated with chromium chloride.
AB  - Addition of small amounts of chromium chloride to a saline suspension of Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPD; Difco) caused a marked reduction in several of the biologic activities of this substance including toxicity, B-cell mitogenicity, plasma colony-stimulating activity (CSA), radioprotective effect, and induction of the dermal Shwartzman reaction. Nevertheless, LPS treated with chromium chloride was found to be at least as effective as untreated LPS in enhancing resistance of B6CBF1 mice to the lethal effects of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.
TI  - Very low frequency and small intensity electromagnetic and magnetic fields as an  oecological factor.
AB  - The effect on microorganisms of electromagnetic and magnetic fields (EMF, MF), the frequency and intensity of which were similar to natural ones, was studied. They were found to influence the physiology of bacteria. Changes in the rate of proliferation of microbes, in their susceptibility to antibiotic the frequency of formation of recombinants and partial diploids during conjugation of colibacterium were observed during cultivation in these fields.
TI  - [Study of the transmissibility of multiple drug resistance and the capacity to ferment lactose in a clinical strain of Kl. pneumoniae].
AB  - The donor properties of K. pneumoniae PI 220 with multiple drug resistance were studied. It was shown that the above strain carried 2 plasmids, i.e. R-plasmid pPI 220 controling resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and sulphanylamides and plasmid pPI 221 controlling lactose fermentation. Both plasmids can be transfered on conjugation to strain E. coli P678 at a temperture of 28 degrees C at a rate of 10(-5) for pPI 220 and 10(-4) for pPI 221. The drug resistance controlled by pPI 221 was transfered mainly in a "blocks" simultaneously to 6 drugs. Deletion of plasmid pPI 220 was observed rarely. The donor properties of the strain were defined by the conjugative plasmid pPI 220 controlling the self-transfer and mobilization of plasmid pPI 221 incapable of the self-transfer. E. coli P678 (pPI 220) (PPI 221) acquired the donor properties and transfered both plasmids to E. coli J62 on crossing simultaneously at a rate of 10(-2), as well as to S. typhimurium LT2 and P. rettgeri at a rate of 10(-5). In all the recipient strains studied the transfered plasmids were unstable and segregated also simultaneously at a rate being the highest for P. retgari PI 230. The clones with stable preservation of the plasmids could be obtained by selection.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some derivatives of tolypomycinone. Relationship between structure and activity in ansamycins.
AB  - 3-Aminotolypomycinoes and 3,16-diamino-16,17-dihydrotolypomycinones are formed by the addition of primary and secondary amines to tolypomycinone, obtained by mild hydrolysis of the antibiotic tolypomycin Y.3-Amino-16,17-dihydrotolypomycinones are formed by the addition of primary and secondary amines to 16,17-dihydrotolypomycinone. In vitro microbiological tests showed high antibacterial activity in compounds obtained by the addition of primary amines, which must be unbranched in the alpha position to the nitrogen atom to position 3 of the naphthoquinone ring. The relationship between structure and activity is described, and evidence is presented that hydrogen bonding between the amino NH bonded to C3 and the amide CO of tolypomycinone is very important for biological activity.
TI  - Bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  - Using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. The biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). Fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The most common ones were Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. The only anaerobe isolated was Clostridium perfringens. Eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. This study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system; therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.
TI  - Enhancement of the sensitivity of the Limulus assay for the detection of Gram negative bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Enhancement of nonspecific immunity to bacterial infection by cord factor (6,6'-trehalose dimycolate).
AB  - The capacity of mycobacteria to enhance the nonspecific resistance of mice to bacterial infections was related to the presence of cord factor. After enzymatic digestion and delipidation, cell walls lost their immunopotentiating activity, which was restored, however, by the addition of cord factor. Cord factor administered alone protected mice effectively against virulent organisms unrelated to mycobacteria. Moreover, although this glycolipid is usually injected as a solution in mineral oil, our data show its effectiveness when administered in metabolizable peanut oil or even as a suspension in water. Since cord factor is a chemically well-defined molecule (6,6'-trehalose dimycolate), this glycolipid should constitute a new and useful tool for the investigation of nonspecific immunity to infection.
TI  - Role of radiosensitive and radioresistant cells in nonspecific resistance to infection of LPS-treated mice.
AB  
TI  - Expression of Klebsiella nif and his genes in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Derivatives of Salmonella typhimurium carrying F prime or P prime plasmids with Klebsiella nif and his genes had specific nitrogenase activities similar to Klebsiella in selective conditions, even to showing "hyperinduction" under argon. No evidence was obtained for catabolite repression of normal nif expression but dibutyl cyclic AMP often augmented "hyperinduction". In non-selective conditions the Klebsiella his nif determinants were rapidly lost from the plasmids; the low levels of nif expression and temperature-sensitive his expression previously reported were probably due to ready loss of his nif in the test conditions used.

TI  - R plasmids coding for gentamicin, tobramycin, and carbenicillin resistance in Serratia, Klebsiella and Escherichia coli strains from a single clinical source.
AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Preferential uptake of thymidine by thymineless enterobacteria: its significance  in DNA labelling.
AB  - Minimum satisfactory concentrations of thymine and thymidine were determined for  the growth of a high thymine-requirng (thy) mutant to Escherichia coli strain J5-3. Cultures were then grown in the presence of these concentrations of non-radioactive ('cold') pyrimidine together with 5 microCi/ml [methyl-3H)thymine, or [methyl-3H)thymidine (specific activities 5 Ci/m mole), and the uptake of radioactivity into ice cold trichloroacetic acid insoluble material determined. By far the most efficient labelling system was obtained if the label was supplied as radioactive thymidine and growth requirements satisfied by thymine alone. The addition of deoxyadenosine to the labelled thymidine/unlabelled thymine system dramatically reduced uptake of label. The addition of radioactive thymine with either thymine or thymidine to ensure satisfactory growth gave poor labelling. Using the [methyl-3H] thymidine/thymine system it was possible to increase the concentration of thymine from 8 to 64 microgram/ml with only a 25% reduction in label uptake after a 2 h period. The same system was also shown to be most efficient for labelling a thy derivative of another K12 strain, a thymine low-requiring (tir) K12 strain, a thy mutant of Klebsiella aerogenes 418 and a tir derivative of Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on Host resistance to  bacterial infections. II. Effects on peritoneal leukocytes of normal mice and mice infected with virulent Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - In normal mice, the total count of peritoneal leukocytes was markedly decreased after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPS-K) depending on the dosage injected. This decrease was mainly due to the depletion of macrophages, and a decrease in the number of lymphocytes occurred to a lesser extent. CPS-K in relatively smaller doses mobilized polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN) into the peritoneal fluid but it decreased them transiently in larger doses. In mice infected i.p. with a virulent strain of Salmonella enteritidis, there was an abundant emigration of PMN into the peritoneal fluid. When 200 mug of CPS-K was injected i.p. immediately before bacterial challenge, emigration of PMN was markedly delayed for 48 hr after infection. Associated with this suppressed emigration of PMN, the numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes in the peritoneal fluid were significantly less in mice treated with CPS-K than those in untreated control mice for 48 hr after infection. The numbers of both cell-associated and extracellular bacteria in the peritoneal fluid were markedly greater in mice treated with CPS-K than those in untreated control mice. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, ingestion of bacteria by macrophages and PMN was not blocked by CPS-K or neutral CPS-K, the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of CPS-K. It appeared that CPS-K somehow impaired the intraphagocytic bactericidal activity.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Adjuvant action of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on antibody response. V. Further biological properties of the active substance.
AB  - The neutral fraction (neutral CPS-K) of Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS-K) from type 1, Kasuya strain, has already been reported as the active substance responsible for the strong adjuvant effect of CPS-K. The present results demonstrate that neutral CPS-K exhibits further common biological activities with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from Salmonella enteritidis. The intensity of the lethality in mice of neutral CPS-K by the intraperitoneal route is very similar to that of LPS. Its lethality for mice by the intravenous (i.v.) route is significantly stronger than that of LPS, because the degree of increase in the sensitivity to their lethality by i.v. challenge is smaller for LPS than for neutral CPS-K. The intensity of the pyrogenicity of neutral CPS-K in rabbits is approximately one-tenth of that of LPS as judged by the minimal pyrogenic doses and fever indices. The skin-preparatory potency of neutral CPS-K for the dermal Shwartzman phenomenon in rabbits is also approximately one-tenth of that of LPS compared on the basis of the minimal skin-preparatory doses. When injected i.v., neutral CPS-K exhibits a provocative effect on hemorrhagic reactions in skin sites prepared with neutral CPS-K or LPS.
TI  - Semisynthetic cephalosporins. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 7-sulfonylacetamido-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The synthesis and in vitro and in vivo activities of a series of 7-sulfonylacetamido-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acids with acetoxymethyl or heterocyclic thiomethyl substituents at the 3 position are described. Lengthening the alkyl chain attached to the sulfonyl group increased gram-positive activity but the effect on gram-negative activity was variable. Other structural changes on the 7-acyl side chain resulted in only minor changes in vitro activity. the protective effectiveness in infected mice generally paralleled the in vitro activity, except that the butylsulfonyl derivatives were less protective than predicted by in vitro activity. replacement of the 3-acetoxymethyl by a 3-heterocyclic thiomethyl group resulted in an overall improvement of activity both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. I. Induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  - When Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS-K) from type 1, Kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with Salmonella enteritidis NUB 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with S. enteritidis NUB 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. The promotion of infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 by CPS-K depended upon its dose, the effect of CPS-K being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. In the case of S. enteritidis NUB 31, the effect of CPS-K was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. As a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that CPS-K promoted in vivo growth of S. enteritidis NUB 1 and NUB 31. In addition, CPS-K enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The peak CPS-K effect on infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. The active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of CPS-K was neutral CPS-K, which is distinct from the O antigen and from acidic CPS-K (the type-specific capsular antigen). Preparations of neutral CPS-K isolated from the other three strains of K. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the Kasuya strain. Neutral CPS-K, with identical antigenicity to that from the Kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. No parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and adjuvant activity of neutral CPS-K.
TI  - Relationship of structure to function in bacterial endotoxins: serologically cross-reactive components and their effect on protection of mice against some gram-negative infections.
AB  - Rabbit antisera were prepared against the heptoseless Re mutants, Salmonella minnesota R595 and S. typhimurium SLI102, as well as against purified R595 glycolipid coated on autologous erythrocytes. The antisera cross-reacted with the endotoxic glycolipids extracted from Re mutants of various bacterial strains, including S. minnesota R595, S. typhimurium SLI102, Escherichia coli D3Im4, E. coli D2If2 and E. coli F515, as shown by passive haemagglutination and gel diffusion tests. The anti-Re sera also cross-reacted with the RESI preparations (a purified 'lipid A' fraction) from the endotoxic lipopolysaccharides of various heterologous smooth Gram-negative bacteria including Serratia marcescens. Psuedomonas fluorescens and E. coli 0127. However, the same antisera failed to protect mice against infection by Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae type II, S. typhi 0901, P. aeruginosa 119 and E. coli. The results suggest that although the lipid moieties of the lipopolysaccharides in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria share cross-reactive immunodeterminant groups, these groups may not be accessible to antibody against them.
TI  - Failure of endotoxin to increase nonspecific resistance to infection of lipopolysaccharide low-responder mice.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various other bacterial immunostimulants were compared in c3H/He low-responder mice. The principal findings were as follows. (i) Their splenic lymphocytes were stimulated by various gram-negative mitogens such as an Escherichia coli peptidoglycan, a detoxified derivative of LPS, and even endotoxins extracted by trichloroacetic acid that are known to contain protein; spleen cells of these mice were also transformed by two other B-cell mitogens extracted from acid-fast organisms. (ii) Their macrophages were refractory to LPS and weakly responsive to a mycobacterial prepartion. (iii) LPS failed to elicit nonspecific resistance in these mice against Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. (iv) Endotoxin extracted by trichloroacetic acid and a mycobacterial preparation that could increase nonspecific resistance to infection in other strains did not protect C3H/He mice against a challenge by K. pneumoniae, although both prepartions could evoke nonspecific responses of B cells in this low-responder subline.
TI  - Derivation and properties of F-prime factors in Escherichia coli carrying nitrogen fixation genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A His+ Nif+ Escherichia coli K12, Hfr strain (UNF43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a Klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (HF3) and a his-HFR E. coli strain (SBI824) which transfers his as an early marker. An F-prime nif plasmid, FN39, carrying genes which correspond to the E. coli chromosomal region, metG gnd his shiA, but excluding purF and aroD, was isolated from UNF43. Translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a P-type R-factor, R68, to FN39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative F-prime, FN68. Sedimentation analysis of both F-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(CCC) DNA species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. It is suggested that the two smallest CCC-DNA species are component replicons of the composite F-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are CCC-dimers. FN68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium but not to Proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to Erwinia herbicola. nif genes on FN68 were expressed in a Nif- mutant of K. pneumoniae and also in S. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of FN68 became temperature-sensitive in S. typhimurium.

TI  - [Antibacterial activity of antibiotics in human bile (author's transl)].
AB  - Marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  Whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. The differences in activity are related to the pH although not all deviations can be attributed to the effect of the pH. These results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.

TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Effect of Klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  - The effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by Klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, Na, and Cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; HCO3 transport was not affected. Net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. The addition of 56 mM glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and Na transport to net absorption in both intestinal segments. The enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect the absorption of either glucose or L-leucine. Intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. These observations confirm the fact that other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. Such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.
TI  - Isolation of a hybrid F' factor-carrying Escherichia coli lactose region and Salmonella typhimurium histidine region, F42-400 (F' ts114 lac+, his+): its partial characterization and behavior in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Episome F' ts114 lac+ (F42-114) was transferred into Salmonella typhimurium carrying an F'his+ (FS400) episome, and fused episome F' ts114 lac+, his+ (F42-400) was obtained. Episome F42-400 could be transferred to S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Identification of the episome was based on: (i) temperature sensitivity of the Lac+ and His+ phenotypes; (ii) the fact that F- segregants, obtained after temperature curing or acridine orange curing, were simultaneously Lac- and His-; and (iii) linkage of lac+ with his+ in episomal transfers to E. coli and S. typhimurium. The frequency of episome transfer was influenced by the genotype of the donor. Plasmid LT2, prevalent in S. typhimurium LT2 strains, was suggested to be responsible for the low fertility of S. typhimurium donors. Episome F42-400 was capable of chromosome mobilization, and the extent of chromosome mobilization was not influenced by the presence or absence of the histidine region on the donor chromosome. Growth in a defined medium with acridine orange was able to cure F42-400. The frequency of curing was increased (the frequency of His+ cells was 0.0001%) if the cells were grown at 40 C in the presence of acridine orange. Selection for temperature-resistant Lac+, His+ derivatives in a strain without histidine deletion yielded Hfr strains. However, similar and stronger selections in strains without the chromosomal histidine region failed to yield Hfr strains. Our inability to obtain Hfr's in strains without the chromosomal histidine region was explained by assuming that the episome F42-400 has lost the F sites involved in integration into the S. typhimurium chromosome.
TI  - Bactericidal and opsonic activities of normal sheep serum against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal and opsonic activities of normal sheep serum against 9 smooth and 4 rough strains of gram-negative bacteria were measured. Three smooth strains-Escherichia coli 3662, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella gallinarum-were resistant to the bactericidal action of normal sheep serum with or without complement. Six smooth strains-E coli O78:K80(B), Salmonella arizonae, Proteus inconstans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella stanley, and Salmonella abortus-equi-were moderately sensitive to bactericidal activity of fresh sheep serum. After complement was added, serum heated at 56 C for 30 minutes did not regain its bactericidal activity against E coli O78:K80(B), P inconstans, nor S abortus-equi. Four rough strains-E coli Lilly, Salmonella cholerae-suis, Shigella sonnei, and Hafnia alvei-were very sensitive to the bactericidal activity of normal sheep serum. Somatic agglutinins were demonstrated in all of the sheep serums against all of the bacteria, but this antibody activity was partially destroyed by heating at 56 C for 30 minutes. The opsonic activity of normal sheep serum was demonstrated in normal mice. In the mouse peritoneal cavity, normal sheep serum enhanced opsonic activity against all smooth strains and 1 rough strain of the bacteria. The other 3 rough strains were extremely sensitive to the opsonic system of normal mice.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Interferon production in mice by the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPS-K) type 1, Kasuya strain, induces interferon production in the blood of mice when injected intravenously. CPS-K resembles bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) in the time pattern of interferon production, with peak levels 2h after injection. CPS-K on a weight basis exhibits a more potent interferon-inducing effect than lipopolysaccharide. The active substance responsible for the interferon-inducing activity of CPS-K is the neutral CPS-K antigen which is antigenically distinct from the O antigen and from acidic CPS-K (the type-specific capsular antigen). Neutral CPS-K from the Kasuya strain has been already found to exhibit a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. Preparations of neutral CPS-K from other strains of K. pneumoniae, of which adjuvant action is only very weak, exhibit interferon-inducing activity similar to the preparation from the Kasuya strain. Heterologous and homologous tolerance to re-induction of interferon is produced by a prior injection (one each) of LPS, neutral CPS-K, and acidic CPS-K. No simple correlation exists between the inducing and tolerogenic capabilities of these substances.
TI  - A new parenteral cephalosporin. SK&F 59962: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and serum levels in experimental animals.
AB  - SK&F 59962, a new parenteral cephalosporin was found to have a high order of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against a broad-spectrum of clinical isolates. When tested in vitro against gram-negative organisms, SK&F 59962 was consistently more active than cefazolin and far superior to cephalothin. This new antibiotic had activity equal to that of cephalothin against gram-positive bacteria. Enterobacter species were found to be susceptible to SK&F 59962. In mouse infection studies using bacterial pathogens, SK&F 59962 had protective activity of the order of that of cefazolin and superior to that of cephalothin. Following parenteral administration the serum profile of SK&F 59962 in the mouse, dog and squirrel monkey was similar to that of cephalothin. SK&F 59962 and cephalothin had lower peak serum concentrations and shorter biologic half-lives than those of cefazolin.
TI  - Occurrence of the bacteriophage lambda receptor in some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - In Escherichia coli K-12, the receptor for phage lambda is an outer membrane protein which inactivates the phage in vitro. Lambda receptor activity was found in extracts from all wild strains of E. coli tested, although most of them fail to support growth of the phage. In some cases this failure is due to a masking of the receptor in vivo, the bacteria being unable to adsorb the phage or to react with antireceptor antibodies. In other cases, adsorption does occur, and the nature of the block in phage growth was not investigated. Most Mal+ strains of Shigella have lambda receptor, whereas most Mal- strains do not have it. Synthesis of the lambda receptor in Shigella is thus presumably controlled by the positive regulator gene of the maltose regulon as is the case in E. coli K-12. Phage lambda adsorbs on many Mal+ strains of Shigella and even yields plaques on some of them, although at a low frequency. No lambda receptor activity could be found in extracts of several strains of Salmonella and Levinea.

AB  - The enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them R-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. Four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. Eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. The remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). All the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. The two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.
TI  - Hydrophobic grid-membrane filters: new approach to microbiological enumeration.
AB  - A square grid pattern, printed in hydrophobic material on conventional membrane filters, subdivided the surface into a plurality of areas. This separated colonies from one another and prevented lateral growth, spreading, and confluence. Very high colony-packing densities were achieved (2,500/in(2); ca. 1.61 x 10(5)/cm(2)) reducing the need to dilute samples. Recovery of organisms was better than on conventional filters, particularly at high inoculum levels. At the same time, visibility of normally pale or diffuse colonies was improved, since colonies grew upwards instead of sideways, and counting was facilitated because colonies grew in orderly arrays.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

AB  - Incompatibility between R factors has been reported by several authors, and four  incompatibility groups have already been described by Datta and Hedges among Rfi(-) factors. The stability of 12 plasmids in pairs was studied after 116 crosses, and five new groups were found, designated 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each plasmid studied belongs to one single group. Incompatibility between plasmids in pairs is a clear-cut phenomenon, is easy to observe, and can provide a reliable method for recognizing and classifying resistance factors, and for tracing their spread among bacterial species.
TI  - Isolation of a polyvalent bacteriophage for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  - A lytic bacteriophage isolated from sewage was found to attack strains of Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not members of the genera Salmonella, Proteus, and Serratia. The phage, designated phimp, contained deoxyribonucleic acid with a 50% guanine plus cytosine ratio and a molecular weight of 23.1 x 10(6) daltons. Single-step growth experiments of phimp plated at 37 C on A. aerogenes A2 gave a mean latent period of 20 min, an average burst size of 103 plaque-forming units/infected cell, and an average adsorption rate constant of 3 x 10(-10) ml/min. Electron microscopy of phimp revealed a phage with a flexible tail (165 nm long and 6 nm wide). The phage head had a hexagonal outline (62 nm in diameter).

Although slight protection was afforded against challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, the immunity was specific to the extent that immunized mice were fully susceptible to infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
TI  - EFFECT OF NATURALLY OCCURRING XANTHINES ON BACTERIA. I. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION AND  POTENTIATING EFFECT ON ANTIBIOTIC SPECTRA.
AB  - The effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. The antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
