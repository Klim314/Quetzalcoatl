TI  == a novel mechanism of latency in matrix metalloproteinases.
AB  == the matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a family of secreted soluble or membrane-anchored multimodular peptidases regularly found in several paralogous copies in animals and plants, where they have multiple functions. the minimal consensus domain architecture comprises a signal peptide, a 60-90-residue globular prodomain with a conserved sequence motif including a cysteine engaged in "cysteine-switch" or "velcro" mediated latency, and a catalytic domain. karilysin, from the human periodontopathogen tannerella forsythia, is the only bacterial mmp to have been characterized biochemically to date. it shares with eukaryotic forms the catalytic domain but none of the flanking domains. instead of the consensus mmp prodomain, it features a 14-residue propeptide, the shortest reported for a metallopeptidase, which lacks cysteines. here we determined the structure of a prokarilysin fragment encompassing the propeptide and the catalytic domain, and found that the former runs across the cleft in the opposite direction to a bound substrate and inhibits the latter through an "aspartate-switch" mechanism. this finding is reminiscent of latency maintenance  in the otherwise unrelated astacin and fragilysin metallopeptidase families. in addition, in vivo and biochemical assays showed that the propeptide contributes to protein folding and stability. our analysis of prokarilysin reveals a novel mechanism of latency and activation in mmps. finally, our findings support the view that the karilysin catalytic domain was co-opted by competent bacteria through horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic source, and later evolved in a specific bacterial environment.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile and production of proinflammatory cytokines in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == this review examines literature data concerning the bacterial findings in chronic periodontitis depending on pocket depth, and presents the latest published information on the presence of proinflammatory factors in periodontal environment. it has been found that chronic periodontitis affects as much as 80%  of the middle-aged population; by comparison, the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis reaches up to 1-1.5%. it is accepted that this social disease is multifactorial in etiology, but the evidence in the literature suggests that the  levels of specific gram-negative organisms in subgingival plaque biofilm play a major role in the initiation and progression of the disease. of the many bacterial species inhabiting the periodontal environment, three types--porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf)--are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of periodontitis. microbiological studies suggest that porphyromonas gingivalis should be considered a major etiologic agent. currently, porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. on the other hand, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemeomitans in patients with chronic periodontitis may be related to the severity of the disease and thus modify the therapeutic plan. the increased amount of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival area can activate a cascade of defense mechanisms of the body associated with the production of factors causing inflammation and destruction, which suggests a correlation between the bacterial findings and the body response implemented by enhancing the local cytokine expression. studies in the literature show that the presence of certain micro-organisms in the periodontal environment  is associated to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingival fluid and gingival tissue. these levels have been associated with destructive tissues response. there is little evidence in the literature on the correlation of the levels of periodontal pathogens of sites with different pocket depth with  periodontal disease activity defined by the degree of the proinflammatory cytokine expression such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin 6 (il-6).

TI  == miropin, a novel bacterial serpin from the periodontopathogen tannerella forsythia, inhibits a broad range of proteases by using different peptide bonds within the reactive center loop.
AB  == all prokaryotic genes encoding putative serpins identified to date are found in environmental and commensal microorganisms, and only very few prokaryotic serpins have been investigated from a mechanistic standpoint. herein, we characterized a  novel serpin (miropin) from the human pathogen tannerella forsythia, a bacterium  implicated in initiation and progression of human periodontitis. in contrast to other serpins, miropin efficiently inhibited a broad range of proteases (neutrophil and pancreatic elastases, cathepsin g, subtilisin, and trypsin) with  a stoichiometry of inhibition of around 3 and second-order association rate constants that ranged from 2.7 x 10(4) (cathepsin g) to 7.1 x 10(5) m(-1)s(-1) (subtilisin). inhibition was associated with the formation of complexes that were stable during sds-page. the unusually broad specificity of miropin for target proteases is achieved through different active sites within the reactive center loop upstream of the p1-p1' site, which was predicted from an alignment of the primary structure of miropin with those of well studied human and prokaryotic serpins. thus, miropin is unique among inhibitory serpins, and it has apparently  evolved the ability to inhibit a multitude of proteases at the expense of a high  stoichiometry of inhibition and a low association rate constant. these characteristics suggest that miropin arose as an adaptation to the highly proteolytic environment of subgingival plaque, which is exposed continually to an array of host proteases in the inflammatory exudate. in such an environment, miropin may function as an important virulence factor by protecting bacterium from the destructive activity of neutrophil serine proteases. alternatively, it may act as a housekeeping protein that regulates the activity of endogenous t. forsythia serine proteases.

TI  == lack of a surface layer in tannerella forsythia mutants deficient in the type ix  secretion system.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is an important pathogen in periodontal disease. this bacterium possesses genes encoding all known components of the type ix secretion system (t9ss). t. forsythia mutants deficient in genes orthologous to the t9ss-encoding genes pork, port and sov were constructed. all pork, port and sov single mutants lacked the surface layer (s-layer) and expressed less-glycosylated versions of the s-layer glycoproteins tfsa and tfsb. in addition, these mutants exhibited decreased haemagglutination and increased biofilm formation. comparison of the proteins secreted by the pork  and wt strains revealed that the secretion of several proteins containing c-terminal domain (ctd)-like sequences is dependent on the pork gene. these results indicate that the t9ss is functional in t. forsythia and contributes to the translocation of ctd proteins to the cell surface or into the extracellular milieu.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaque.
AB  == background: there has been increasing attention paid in recent years to the possibility that oral bacterial infection, particularly periodontal disease may influence the initiation and or progression of systemic diseases. these studies confirm the observation that heart disease is the most commonly found systemic condition in patients with periodontal disease. moreover, the literature has also highlighted substantial evidence indicating the presence of gram-negative periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. aim: this study intends to investigate the possible association between periodontal health and coronary artery disease by evaluating periodontal status, association between the periodontal plaque and coronary atheromatous plaques for presence of micro-organisms such as, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia. materials and methods: a case-control study was designed with seven patients who had undergone  coronary endarterectomy for cardiovascular disease and 28 controls. the periodontal examination for cases was performed 1 day before vascular surgery and the controls were clinically examined. the atheromatous plaque sample collected during endarterectomy and the intraoral plaque samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for identification of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia. results: the presence of periodontal  bacteria dna in coronary atheromatous plaques and sub-gingival plaque samples of  the same patients was confirmed by this study. conclusion a correlation was established between putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques and species associated with periodontal disease. one particularly important study to  be carried out is the investigation of a possible clinically meaningful reduction in coronary heart disease resulting from the prevention or treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == the s-layer proteins of tannerella forsythia are secreted via a type ix secretion system that is decoupled from protein o-glycosylation.
AB  == conserved c-terminal domains (ctd) have been shown to act as a signal for the translocation of certain proteins across the outer membrane of bacteroidetes via  a type ix secretion system (t9ss). the genome sequence of the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia predicts the presence of the components for a t9ss  in conjunction with a suite of ctd proteins. t. forsythia is covered with a two-dimensional crystalline surface (s-) layer composed of the glycosylated ctd proteins tfsa and tfsb. to investigate, if t9ss is functional in t. forsythia, t9ss-deficient mutants were generated by targeting either tf0955 (putative c-terminal signal peptidase) or tf2327 (pork ortholog), and the mutants were analyzed with respect to secretion, assembly and glycosylation of the s-layer proteins as well as proteolytic processing of the ctd and biofilm formation. in either mutant, tfsa and tfsb were incapable of translocation, as evidenced by the absence of the s-layer in transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin-sectioned bacterial cells. despite being entrapped within the periplasm, mass spectrometry  analysis revealed that the s-layer proteins were modified with the complete, mature glycan found on the secreted proteins, indicating that protein translocation and glycosylation are two independent processes. further, the t9ss  mutants showed a denser biofilm with fewer voids compared with the wild-type. this study demonstrates the functionality of t9ss and the requirement of ctd for  the outer membrane passage of extracellular proteins in t. forsythia, exemplified by the two s-layer proteins. in addition, t9ss protein translocation is decoupled from o-glycan attachment in t. forsythia.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens of the mandibular third molar pericoronitis by using real time pcr.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the mandibular third molar pericoronitis flora by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: the quantitative values of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi) and tannerella forsythia (tf) were evaluated in comparison with the healthy third molar flora by using real time pcr. results: aa, cr, pg, and pi were not statistically significant but numerically higher than the pericoronitis group. in contrast to samples from control subjects, statistically significant higher numbers of tf were detected in samples from pericoronitis patients. the study revealed the strong relation between risk of pericoronitis and the presence of tf. individuals who have tf in  their samples present with an almost eight times relative risk of pericoronitis as the individuals with an absence of tf in their samples. conclusion: tf plays an important role in the development of clinical symptoms related to pericoronitis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis: major periodontopathic pathogen overview.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and is a member of more than 500 bacterial species  that live in the oral cavity. this anaerobic bacterium is a natural member of the oral microbiome, yet it can become highly destructive (termed pathobiont) and proliferate to high cell numbers in periodontal lesions: this is attributed to its arsenal of specialized virulence factors. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of one of the main periodontal pathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis. this bacterium, along with treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, constitute the "red complex," a prototype polybacterial pathogenic consortium in periodontitis. this review outlines porphyromonas gingivalis structure, its metabolism, its ability to colonize the epithelial cells, and its  influence upon the host immunity.

TI  == periodontal pathogens and associated factors in aggressive periodontitis: results 5-17 years after active periodontal therapy.
AB  == objectives: to assess the association between presence of periodontal pathogens and recurrence of disease in patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) after active periodontal therapy (apt) and further influencing factors. material & methods: microbiological samples were taken from 73 patients with agp 5-17 years  after apt at 292 sites (deepest site per quadrant). real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to detect the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. uni- and multivariate analyses evaluated the associations between pathogens and recurrence of disease, smoking and adjunctive antibiotic therapy. results: at re-examination a. actinomycetemcomitans could be detected in six patients (8.2%), p. gingivalis in 24 (32.9%), t. forsythia in 31 (42.5%) and  t. denticola in 35 (48.0%). increased levels of t. forsythia and t. denticola at  re-examination were significantly associated with recurrence of disease in multivariate analyses (or: 12.72, p < 0.001; or 5.55, p = 0.002 respectively). furthermore, high counts of t. denticola were found in patients with increased percentage of sites with clinical attachment levels (cal) >/= 6 mm compared to those with low counts (13.8% versus 3.2%, p = 0.005). conclusion: in patients with recurrence of disease t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected more frequently and in higher counts. furthermore, t. denticola was found more frequently in patients with increased cal.

TI  == bis-enoxacin blocks rat alveolar bone resorption from experimental periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial, caused by polymicrobial subgingival pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. chronic periodontal infection results in inflammation, destruction of connective tissues, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. enoxacin and a bisphosphonate derivative of enoxacin (bis-enoxacin) inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption and also contain antibiotic properties. our study proposes that enoxacin and/or bis-enoxacin may be useful in reducing alveolar bone resorption and possibly bacterial colonization. rats were infected with 10(9) cells of polymicrobial inoculum consisting of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, as an oral  lavage every other week for twelve weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin (5 mg/kg/day), bis-enoxacin (5, 25 mg/kg/day), alendronate (1, 10 mg/kg/day), or doxycycline (5 mg/day) were administered after 6 weeks of polymicrobial infection. periodontal disease parameters, including bacterial colonization/infection, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone resorption,  and systemic spread, were assessed post-euthanasia. all three periodontal pathogens colonized the rat oral cavity during polymicrobial infection. polymicrobial infection induced an increase in total alveolar bone resorption, intrabony defects, and gingival inflammation. treatment with bis-enoxacin significantly decreased alveolar bone resorption more effectively than either alendronate or doxycycline. histologic examination revealed that treatment with bis-enoxacin and enoxacin reduced gingival inflammation and decreased apical migration of junctional epithelium. these data support the hypothesis that bis-enoxacin and enoxacin may be useful for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == pathogens and host immunity in the ancient human oral cavity.
AB  == calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) preserves for millennia and entraps biomolecules from all domains of life and viruses. we report the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution taxonomic and protein functional characterization of the ancient oral microbiome and demonstrate that the oral cavity has long served  as a reservoir for bacteria implicated in both local and systemic disease. we characterize (i) the ancient oral microbiome in a diseased state, (ii) 40 opportunistic pathogens, (iii) ancient human-associated putative antibiotic resistance genes, (iv) a genome reconstruction of the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia, (v) 239 bacterial and 43 human proteins, allowing confirmation of a long-term association between host immune factors, 'red complex' pathogens and periodontal disease, and (vi) dna sequences matching dietary sources. directly datable and nearly ubiquitous, dental calculus permits  the simultaneous investigation of pathogen activity, host immunity and diet, thereby extending direct investigation of common diseases into the human evolutionary past.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 37. susceptibility to periodontal diseases].
AB  == in the eighties of the former century it was observed that individuals had different modes of development of periodontitis, largely for unknown reasons. it  was assumed that periodontal disease developed as a result of the presence of virulent micro-organisms in combination with an inadequate host response. the concept of this (im)balance in host parasite interactions developed further, in part because of new research techniques. with respect to oral bacteria it was shown that periodontal pathogens like aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are risk factors for periodontitis. furthermore, genetic polymorphisms (snp's) have been shown to modulate the host response against the periopathogens. medical and lifestyle factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, smoking, psychological stress and, to a minor extent, also hormonal changes can have an impact on the progression of periodontitis. all this information contributes to determining the individual risk profile of a patient for developing periodontitis and for estimating the prognosis of periodontal treatment and maintenance care on an individual basis.

TI  == single cell genomics of uncultured, health-associated tannerella bu063 (oral taxon 286) and comparison to the closely related pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == the uncultivated bacterium tannerella bu063 (oral taxon 286) is the closest relative to the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia, but is not disease-associated itself. using a single cell genomics approach, we isolated 12  individual bu063 cells by flow cytometry, and we amplified and sequenced their genomes. comparative analyses of the assembled genomic scaffolds and their gene contents allowed us to study the diversity of this taxon within the oral community of a single human donor that provided the sample. eight different bu063 genotypes were represented, all about 5% divergent at the nucleotide level. there were 2 pairs of cells and one group of three that were more highly identical, and may represent clonal populations. we did pooled assemblies on the nearly identical genomes to increase the assembled genomic coverage. the presence of a set of 66 "core" housekeeping genes showed that two of the single cell assemblies and the assembly derived from the three putatively identical cells were essentially complete. as expected, the genome of bu063 is more similar to tannerella forsythia than any other known genome, although there are significant  differences, including a 44% difference in gene content, changes in metabolic pathways, loss of synteny, and an 8-9% difference in gc content. several identified virulence genes of t. forsythia are not found in bu063 including karilysin, prth, and bspa. the absence of these genes may explain the lack of periodontal pathogenesis by this species and provides a new foundation to further understand the genome evolution and mechanisms of bacterial-host interaction in closely related oral microbes with different pathogenicity potential.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == in vitro-activity of oily calcium hydroxide suspension on microorganisms as well  as on human alveolar osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  == background: findings from animal and human studies have indicated that an oily calcium hydroxide suspension (ochs) may improve early wound healing in the treatment of periodontitis. calcium hydroxide as the main component is well known for its antimicrobial activity, however at present the effect of ochs on the influence of periodontal wound healing/regeneration is still very limited. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of ochs on periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as on the attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. methods: human alveolar osteoblasts (hao) and periodontal ligament (pdl) fibroblasts were cultured on 3 concentrations of ochs (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg). adhesion and proliferation were counted up to 48 h and mineralization was assayed after 1 and 2 weeks. furthermore potential growth inhibitory activity on microorganisms associated with periodontal disease (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) as well as the influence of periodontopathogens and ochs on the hao and pdl fibroblasts counts were determined. results: more than a 2-fold increase in adherent hao cells was observed at 4 h following application of ochs when compared to the control group  (p = 0.007 for 2.5 mg). proliferation of hao cells at 48 h was stimulated by moderate concentrations (2.5 mg; 5 mg) of ochs (each p < 0.001), whereas a high concentration (7.5 mg) of ochs was inhibitory (p = 0.009). mineralization was observed only for hao cells treated with ochs. ochs did not exert any positive effect on attachment or proliferation of pdl fibroblasts. although ochs did not have an antibacterial effect, it did positively influence attachment and proliferation of hao cells and pdl fibroblasts in the presence of periodontopathogens. conclusions: the present data suggests that ochs promotes osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization in a concentration-dependent manner and results are maintained in the presence of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB  == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where  nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor  and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd  ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == association of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria in postmenopausal females.
AB  == background: previous findings of an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d] concentrations and periodontal disease may be partially explained by the antimicrobial properties of vitamin d. to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has investigated the association between 25(oh)d and pathogenic oral bacteria, a putative cause of periodontal disease. methods: the association between plasma 25(oh)d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria was examined among postmenopausal females in the buffalo osteoporosis and periodontal disease  study (1997 to 2000), an ancillary study of the women's health initiative observational study. subgingival plaque samples were assessed using immunofluorescence for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and campylobacter rectus. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for prevalent bacteria by quintile (q) of 25(oh)d concentrations, adjusting for age and body mass index. results: of the 855 participants, 288 (34%) had deficient/inadequate (<50 nmol/l) 25(oh)d concentrations, and 496 (58%) had at least one species of pathogenic bacteria. no significant association was found between 25(oh)d and presence of any of these bacteria (adjusted or for high [q5] compared to low [q1] 25(oh)d = 0.96; 95% ci:  0.61 to 1.50; p for trend = 0.50). inverse, although not statistically significant, associations were found between 25(oh)d and more than one species of pathogenic bacteria (adjusted or for adequate compared to deficient/inadequate 25(oh)d = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.60 to 1.19). conclusions: no association was observed between pathogenic oral bacteria and 25(oh)d concentrations in postmenopausal females. this may be attributable to the species of bacteria assessed, small effect size, or a true absence of an association.

TI  == oral hygiene reinforcement in the simplified periodontal treatment of 1 hour.
AB  == aim: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of the 1-h ultrasonic debridement of chronic periodontitis patients (cpp) with and without frequent sessions of oral hygiene reinforcement. methods: clinical measurements and subgingival plaque were collected from 44 cpp at baseline, 3- and 6-months. the control group received a single session of 1-h full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, while oral hygiene instructions (ohi) were reiterated over four visits. in the test group, ohi were limited in the 1-h treatment session. at 3-months, both groups received additional debridement and ohi. the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique quantified porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in plaque. results: at three months, smaller reductions in plaque and bleeding indices, and in p. gingivalis numbers were noted in the test group, while these differences disappeared at six months. after the 3-month  re-treatment visit, the test group presented with a greater probing pocket depth  (ppd) reduction. plaque negatively affected ppd in a similar manner after both treatment approaches. conclusions: lack of oral hygiene reinforcement in the 1-h  full-mouth debridement resulted in higher plaque and bleeding scores and numbers  of p. gingivalis at three months; professional removal of dental biofilm every three months is beneficial in subjects with compromised plaque control.

TI  == oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex  anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been  shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that  oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration  (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the  downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed  of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree,  demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

TI  == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == protein substrates of a novel secretion system are numerous in the bacteroidetes  phylum and have in common a cleavable c-terminal secretion signal, extensive post-translational modification, and cell-surface attachment.
AB  == the secretion of certain proteins in porphyromonas gingivalis is dependent on a c-terminal domain (ctd). after secretion, the ctd is cleaved prior to extensive modification of the mature protein, probably with lipopolysaccharide, therefore enabling attachment to the cell surface. in this study, bioinformatic analyses of the ctd demonstrated the presence of three conserved sequence motifs. these motifs were used to construct hidden markov models (hmms) that predicted 663 ctd-containing proteins in 21 fully sequenced species of the bacteroidetes phylum, while no ctd-containing proteins were predicted in species outside this phylum. further hmm searching of cytophaga hutchinsonii led to a total of 171 predicted ctd proteins in that organism alone. proteomic analyses of membrane fractions and culture fluid derived from p. gingivalis and four other species containing predicted ctds (parabacteroides distasonis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and c. hutchinsonii) demonstrated that membrane localization, extensive post-translational modification, and ctd-cleavage were conserved features of the secretion system. the ctd cleavage site of 10 different proteins from 3 different species was determined and found to be similar to the cleavage site previously determined in p. gingivalis, suggesting that homologues  of the c-terminal signal peptidase (pg0026) are responsible for the cleavage in these species.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola synergistic polymicrobial biofilm development.
AB  == chronic periodontitis has a polymicrobial biofilm aetiology and interactions between key bacterial species are strongly implicated as contributing to disease  progression. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia have all been implicated as playing roles in disease progression. p. gingivalis cell-surface-located protease/adhesins, the gingipains, have been suggested to be involved in its interactions with several other bacterial species. the aims of this study were to determine polymicrobial biofilm formation by p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia, as well as the role of p. gingivalis gingipains in biofilm formation by using a gingipain null triple mutant. to determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using dna species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. of the three species, only p. gingivalis and t. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. this synergy was  demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. in addition there was a morphological  change of t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. p. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with t. denticola.

AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI  == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether  subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or  h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and  45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp  il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal  therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

AB  == purpose: to analyze the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics (interleukins 1beta and 6) in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and with peri-implant mucositis.  materials and methods: clinical parameters (modified gingival index [mgi], modified plaque index [mpi], probing pocket depth [ppd], and absence or presence  of radiologic bone loss) were recorded, and pisf samples were obtained from peri-implant sites showing mucositis as well as healthy sites. the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl) and the interleukin (il) 1beta and il-6 values. results: the study population consisted of 34 individuals, and 77 dental implants were evaluated during the study (23 mucositis and 54 healthy peri-implant sites). the  mgi, mpi, and ppd scores of the peri-implant mucositis group were significantly greater than in the healthy group. no differences in detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens and tbl between the healthy peri-implant sites and mucositis sites. the mucositis group showed a significantly greater expression of il-6 than the healthy group (p < .05). although il-1beta was increased in the mucositis group, there was no statistically significant difference versus the healthy implant group. conclusions: an analysis was made of the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in implants with peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons with healthy implants. in the patients studied, bacterial plaque induced an inflammatory response that can lead to the development of peri-implant mucositis. adequate plaque control is therefore able to increase peri-implant health, avoiding the risk of future complications. no specific association to the studied bacterial species was established.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == isolation of treponema and tannerella spp. from equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis related periodontal disease.
AB  == reasons for performing study: red complex bacteria, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, are involved in the onset and progression of periodontal disease in man, yet seldom inhabit the oral  cavity of healthy individuals. periodontal disease is also encountered in horses, with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (eotrh) constituting a particular form of disease. however, only little is known about the oral microbiome of healthy and periodontitis-affected equids. objective: we aimed to test the hypothesis that red complex bacteria are also associated with eotrh-related periodontal disease. study design: controlled cross-sectional study. methods: we screened dna purified from crevicular fluid derived from 23 eotrh-affected and 21 disease-free horses for the presence of treponema spp., tannerella spp. and porphyromonas gingivalis dna by polymerase chain reaction. subsequently, amplified dna was bidirectionally sequenced and identified via blast analysis. results: treponema and/or tannerella dna was detected in 100% of  periodontitis-related samples and in 52.2% of dna derived from healthy horses. twenty-six amplicon sequences were 98-100% homologous to published bacterial sequences, which mostly corresponded to treponema pectinovorum, oral treponema clones ju025 and omz 840, and tannerella forsythia. p. gingivalis dna was only found in 3 eotrh-related samples. forty-three amplicon sequences revealed weaker  homologies ranging between 80% and 97% to known treponema or tannerella strains,  partly because of their heterogeneity, partly because they obviously represented  so far unknown types. conclusions: this is the first report in which known and novel treponema and tannerella spp. were isolated in association with eotrh-related periodontal disease.

TI  == gingipain-dependent degradation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway proteins by the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis during invasion.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are gram-negative pathogens strongly associated with periodontitis. their abilities to interact, invade and persist within host cells are considered crucial to their pathogenicity, but the  mechanisms by which they subvert host defences are not well understood. in this study, we set out to investigate whether p. gingivalis and t. forsythia directly  target key signalling molecules that may modulate the host cell phenotype to favour invasion and persistence. our data identify, for the first time, that p. gingivalis, but not t. forsythia, reduces levels of intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) in oral epithelial cells following invasion over a 4-h time course, via the action of gingipains. the ability of cytochalasin d to abrogate p. gingivalis-mediated mtor degradation suggests that this effect is dependent upon cellular invasion. we also show that levels of several other proteins in the mtor signalling pathway are modulated by gingipains, either directly or as a consequence of mtor degradation including p-4e-bp1. taken together, our data suggest that p. gingivalis manipulates the mtor pathway, providing evidence for a potentially novel mechanism by which p. gingivalis mediates its effects on host cell responses to infection.

AB  == aim: to examine the 2-year post-therapy kinetics of change in the composition of  subgingival biofilms. material and methods: in this study, 178 chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited and clinically monitored at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy. all subjects received scaling and root planing and 156 one or more of periodontal surgery, systemically administered amoxicillin + metronidazole or local tetracycline at pockets >/=5 mm. subgingival biofilm samples taken from each subject at each time point were analysed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the significance of changes in median species counts over time was sought using the wilcoxon or friedman tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean counts were significantly reduced from baseline to 2 years for 30 of the 40  taxa. marked reductions were observed for periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and eubacterium nodatum. the kinetics of change differed from species to species. when data were subset according to baseline pd, patterns of change in the microbial profiles were generally similar. conclusion: periodontal therapy leads to a rapid reduction in periodontal pathogens, followed by a slower reduction in other taxa that can be sustained for at least 2 years.

TI  == determining the presence of periodontopathic virulence factors in short-term postmortem alzheimer's disease brain tissue.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a link between periodontal disease and alzheimer's disease (ad) with a view to identifying the major periodontal disease bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and/or bacterial components in brain tissue from 12 h postmortem delay. our request matched 10 ad cases for tissue from brains for dementia research alongside 10 non-ad age-related controls with similar or greater postmortem interval. we exposed svgp12, an astrocyte cell line, to culture supernatant containing lipopolysaccharide (lps) from the putative periodontal bacteria p. gingivalis. the challenged svgp12 cells and cryosections from ad and  control brains were immunolabeled and immunoblotted using a battery of antibodies including the anti-p. gingivalis-specific monoclonal antibody. immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated the svgp12 cell line was able to adsorb lps from culture supernatant on its surface membrane; similar labeling was observed in four out of 10 ad cases. immunoblotting demonstrated bands corresponding to lps from p. gingivalis in the svgp12 cell lysate and in the same four ad brain specimens which were positive when screened by immunofluorescence. all controls remained negative throughout while the same four cases were consistently positive for p. gingivalis lps (p = 0.029). this study confirms that lps from periodontal bacteria can access the ad brain during life as labeling in the corresponding controls, with equivalent/longer postmortem interval, was absent. demonstration of a known chronic oral-pathogen-related virulence factor reaching the human brains suggests an inflammatory role in the existing ad pathology.

TI  == association between il8 haplotypes and pathogen levels in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is considered to be a multifactorial disease influenced by microbial and genetic factors. the aim of the present study was to  investigate whether the genetic susceptibility to cp in individuals with the il8  atc/ttc haplotype is associated with subgingival levels of periodontopathogens. sixty-five individuals, grouped according to the presence (n = 28) or absence (n  = 37) of the il8 haplotype, were evaluated. after clinical periodontal evaluation, each group was subdivided according to the presence (cp) or absence (h) of periodontitis. four subgingival samples were obtained from cp and two samples per subject from h patients. the levels and proportions of porphyromonas  gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr). no differences were found in the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria between groups with the  presence or absence of the il8 haplotype. however, in the cp groups, the levels of periodontopathogens were significantly higher in the individuals without the il8 haplotype than in the individuals with the il8 haplotype. these results suggest that periodontal destruction may occur in patients who are considered to  be genetically susceptible to cp with a lower microbial challenge because of the  presence of the il8 atc/ttc haplotype than in patients without this haplotype.

TI  == soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) in gingival crevicular fluid: association with clinical and microbiologic parameters.
AB  == background: soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in amplification of the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. this cross-sectional study aims to  investigate the levels of strem-1 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of individuals without periodontitis and with chronic periodontitis (cp) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and their association with the levels of key periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. methods: gcf and subgingival  plaque samples were obtained from healthy sites of participants without periodontitis (n = 20) and periodontitis sites of patients with cp (n = 22) and gagp (n = 20). strem-1 levels in gcf were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans levels in subgingival plaque were analyzed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: strem-1 levels in gcf were higher in cp and gagp than healthy sites by 3.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively, with no significant differences between the two forms of periodontitis. moreover, strem-1 levels in gcf were positively correlated with site-specific clinical periodontal parameters and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, but not a. actinomycetemcomitans, in subgingival plaque. conclusion: increased gcf levels of strem-1 at diseased sites and their positive correlation with clinical and microbiologic parameters strengthen the association of this inflammatory marker with periodontitis.

TI  == modification of forsythia detaching factor by gingival crevicular fluid in periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: forsythia detaching factor (fdf) is a virulence factor of tannerella  forsythia detected as a mixture of the 60-kda form of fdf and the 28-kda c-terminal fragment (fdfc). the objective of the present study was to clarify the proteolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from patients with periodontitis and healthy subjects using recombinant fdf (rfdf) as substrate. design: eleven patients with periodontitis and 6 healthy subjects were recruited. modification of rfdf and subsequent production of rfdfc by proteolytic activity of gcf was determined by western blotting. proteolytic activity of gcf was evaluated using an ac-arg-ala-lys-p-nitroaniline substrate. correlation analysis  between two different sets of variables was performed. variables used in this analysis were proteolytic activity, clinical parameters, relative band density of rfdfc and those of rfdf. results: proteolytic activity in gcf was significantly higher in patients with periodontitis than in healthy subjects. production of rfdfc was determined by treatment of rfdf with gcf from patients with periodontitis and with gcf from healthy subjects. correlations between clinical parameters and proteolytic activity in gcf were significantly positive. on the other hand, correlations between relative band density of rfdfc or rfdf on western blot and cleaving activity or clinical parameters were significantly negative. conclusion: the detected extend of gcf-activity generating rfdfc from rfdf and/or even further degrading rfdf correlates with severity of periodontitis.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116  (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a  significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this  threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with major periodontal pathogens induced periodontal disease and aortic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apoe(null) mice.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerosis are both polymicrobial and multifactorial and although observational studies supported the association, the  causative relationship between these two diseases is not yet established. polymicrobial infection-induced periodontal disease is postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque growth by enhancing atherosclerotic risk factors of orally infected apolipoprotein e deficient (apoe(null)) mice. at 16 weeks of infection,  samples of blood, mandible, maxilla, aorta, heart, spleen, and liver were collected, analyzed for bacterial genomic dna, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone loss, serum inflammatory marker, atherosclerosis risk factors, and  aortic atherosclerosis. pcr analysis of polymicrobial-infected (porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], treponema denticola [t. denticola], and tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia]) mice resulted in detection of bacterial genomic dna in  oral plaque samples indicating colonization of the oral cavity by all three species. fluorescent in situ hybridization detected p. gingivalis and t. denticola within gingival tissues of infected mice and morphometric analysis showed an increase in palatal alveolar bone loss (p<0.0001) and intrabony defects suggesting development of periodontal disease in this model. polymicrobial-infected mice also showed an increase in aortic plaque area (p<0.05) with macrophage accumulation, enhanced serum amyloid a, and increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides. a systemic infection was indicated by the detection of bacterial genomic dna in the aorta and liver of infected mice and elevated levels of bacterial specific igg antibodies (p<0.0001). this study was a unique effort to understand the effects of a polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia on periodontal disease and associated atherosclerosis in apoe(null) mice.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens and metabolic control of type 1 diabetes patients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque collected at different probing depths of type 1 diabetes patients with periodontal disease in correlation to metabolic control. methods: twenty-one patients 40 to 50 years old were included in the study. in each patient blood samples were taken for the evaluation of hba1c level and subgingival plaque samples were taken with paper points from the two deepest pockets. the presence of five periodontal pathogens was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: the results of 38 plaque samples showed that  t. forsythia was found in 48% followed by t. denticola in 31%, p. gingivalis in 26%, p. intermedia in 9% and a. actinomycetemcomitans in 7%. t. forsythia and t.  denticola were the most frequent combination of periodontal pathogens found in the same sample. the serum level of hba1c in nine patients where t. forsythia was detected (7.5 +/- 1.4%) was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) than in 12 patients where t. forsythia was not detected (6.8 +/- 0.5%). similarly, the serum level of hba1c was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) in eight patients where t. denticola was detected (7.5 +/- 1.8%) compared to the 13 patients where  t. denticola was not detected (7.0 +/- 0.5%). no such correlation was found for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: we conclude that t. forsythia and t. denticola are most frequently found in subgingival plaque samples of type 1 diabetic patients and these findings correlate with poorer metabolic control of diabetes.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on tissue levels of toll-like receptor and cytokine mrnas in feline chronic gingivostomatitis and oral health.
AB  == feline chronic gingivostomatitis (fcgs) is an inflammatory disease of the oral cavity that causes severe pain and distress in affected cats. treatment methods are currently very limited. the aims of this study were to assess the feline innate immune response by investigating the levels of cytokine and toll-like receptor (tlr) mrnas in tissue biopsies of cats with and without fcgs, and to relate this to the presence or absence of putative oral pathogens identified previously within these cats. mucosal biopsies were collected from 28 cats with fcgs and eight healthy cats. the levels of tlr (tlr2, tlr3, tlr4, tlr7, tlr9) and cytokine (il-1beta, il-4, il-6, il-10, il-12, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma) mrna was determined using quantitative pcr. in the fcgs group a statistically significant  increase was seen in tlr2, tlr7, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il-1beta and il-6 mrna levels compared to the healthy group. in cats where tannerella forsythia was present, statistically significant increases were seen in tlr2, tlr4, tlr7, tlr9, tnf-alpha and il-1beta mrna levels compared to cats where this putative pathogen  was absent. statistically significant increases in mrna expression were also seen in cats harbouring feline calicivirus (fcv) (tlr2, il-1beta, il-6, ifn-gamma) and porphyromonas circumdentaria (tlr2, tlr3) compared to cats where these putative pathogens were absent. pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and pseudomonas sp. did not significantly alter the expression of any tlr or cytokine mrnas when compared to animals who tested negative for these species, while cats colonised with p. multocida subsp. septica demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the expression of tlr7, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma mrnas compared to cats free of this species. the expression of mrna for several tlrs and cytokines  is elevated in fcgs. a positive correlation was observed between clinical disease severity and the presence of fcv (p=0.001; rho=0.58). although the number of cats harbouring t. forsythia was low by comparison, 80% of samples in which it was present were from cases with the highest clinical disease severity. positive correlations with clinical disease severity were seen for tlr2 (p=0.00086), tlr7  (p=0.049), tnf-alpha (p=0.027), ifn-gamma (p=0.0015), il-1beta (p=0.004) and il-6 (p=0.00001) mrnas. the putative pathogens fcv and t. forsythia may be important in stimulating a host immune response to fcgs and may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

AB  == background: this study evaluated the effects of c. verbenacea essential oil topically administered in a rat periodontitis model. methods: periodontitis was induced on rats in one of the mandibular first molars assigned to receive a ligature. animals were randomly divided into two groups: a) non-treatment group (nt) (n = 18): animals received 1ml of vehicle; b) c. verbenacea group (c.v.) (n  = 18): animals received 5mg/kg of essential oils isolated from c. verbenacea. the therapies were administered topically 3 times daily for 11 days. then, the specimens were processed for morphometric analysis of bone loss. the ligatures were used for microbiological assessment of the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis using pcr. the gingival tissue was collected to elisa assay of interleukin (il)-1alpha  and il-10 levels. results: bone loss was inhibited by c. verbenacea when compared to the nt group (p < 0.05). a decrease in the levels of il-1alpha and increase in the il-10 amounts was observed in the c.v. group as compared to nt group (p < 0.05). a lower frequency of p. gingivalis was found in c.v. group (p < 0.05). conclusion: c. verbenacea essential oil topically administered diminished alveolar bone resorption, promoting a positive local imbalance in the pro/anti-inflammatory system and reducing the frequency of detection of p. gingivalis.

AB  == background: the purpose of this single-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of boric acid irrigation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) on clinical and microbiologic parameters and compare this method with chlorhexidine irrigation and srp alone in patients with  chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: forty-five systemically healthy patients with cp are included in this study. they were divided into three groups: 1) srp + saline irrigation (c); 2) srp + chlorhexidine irrigation (chx); and 3) srp + boric acid irrigation (b). to determine an ideal concentration of boric acid, a preclinical analysis was conducted. at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment, clinical measurements, including plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop), were performed, and subgingival plaque samples were taken. quantitative analysis of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), and treponema denticola (td) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedures. results: the concentration of boric acid is 0.75% in this study. all clinical parameters showed statistically significant reduction at all time points compared to baseline in all groups (p <0.001). whole-mouth pd and cal reduction was similar in all groups at all time points after treatment (p >0.05). the pd and cal reductions for moderately deep pockets (pd >/=5 and <7) were greater in the b group compared to other groups between baseline and 1 month (p <0.05). for deep pockets (pd >/=7), reductions were similar in the b and chx groups (p >0.05). bop (percentage) was significantly lower in the b group compared with the chx and c groups in the first month after treatment (p <0.001). gi and pi scores were significantly lower in the b and chx groups compared with the c group at all time points after treatment (p <0.05). the amounts of pg, tf,  and td were significantly reduced in all treatment groups after 1 month (p <0.05). no statistically significant differences were detected among the groups for microbiologic parameters at any time points after treatment (p >0.05). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that boric acid could be an alternative to chlorhexidine, and it might be more favorable because boric acid was superior in whole-mouth bop as well as pd and cal reduction for moderate pockets in early time periods.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == differential proteomic analysis of a polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases  in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and  t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

TI  == a common periodontal pathogen has an adverse association with both acute and stable coronary artery disease.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and salivary levels of four major periodontal pathogens. methods: the study population (n = 492) was composed of 179 (36.4%) patients with stable cad, 166 (33.7%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs), and 119 (24.2%) showing no pathological findings by coronary angiography. all patients were subjected to a detailed oral health examination. the saliva samples were analyzed for lipopolysaccharide activity as well as for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia by quantitative pcr. serum antibodies levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans were analyzed. results: the level of bacterial burden was linearly associated with alveolar bone loss (p < 0.001) and bleeding on probing (p = 0.015). the median salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans in pathogen-positive patients were significantly higher in the "stable cad" (p = 0.014) and the "acs" (p = 0.044) groups when compared to "no significant cad" patients. in logistic regression models, a 10-fold increase in the salivary a. actinomycetemcomitans levels was associated with a risk for stable cad and acs with odds ratios (ors) of 7.47 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.57-35.5, p = 0.012) and 4.31 (95% ci: 1.06-17.5, p = 0.041), respectively. the or for the association of iga-class antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans with acs risk was 3.13 (95% ci: 1.38-7.12, p = 0.006)/log(10) unit increase. conclusions: high salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and systemic exposure to the bacterium were associated with increased risk for cad. these findings emphasize the importance of oral microbiota in cardiovascular risk assessment and therapeutics.

TI  == identification of a unique tlr2-interacting peptide motif in a microbial leucine-rich repeat protein.
AB  == pathogenesis of many bacterially-induced inflammatory diseases is driven by toll-like receptor (tlr) mediated immune responses following recognition of bacterial factors by different tlrs. periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting apparatus often leading to tooth loss, and is caused by a gram-negative bacterial consortium that includes tannerella forsythia. this bacterium expresses a virulence factor, the bspa, which drives periodontal inflammation by activating tlr2. the n-terminal portion of the bspa protein comprises a leucine-rich repeat (lrr) domain previously shown to be involved in the binding and activation of tlr2. the objective of the current study was to identify specific epitopes in the lrr domain of bspa that interact with tlr2. our results demonstrate that a sequence motif gc(s/t)glxsit is involved in mediating  the interaction of bspa with tlr2. thus, our study has identified a peptide motif that mediates the binding of a bacterial protein to tlr2 and highlights the promiscuous nature of tlr2 with respect to ligand binding. this work could provide a structural basis for designing peptidomimetics to modulate the activity of tlr2 in order to block bacterially-induced inflammation.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == effects of systemic sitafloxacin on periodontal infection control in elderly patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the microbiological and clinical effects of the systemic administration of sitafloxacin (stfx) on periodontal pockets in elderly patients  receiving supportive periodontal therapy (spt). background: periodontitis is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. better periodontal health contributes to reduce  atherosclerosis-related diseases in elderly population. materials and methods: forty-four patients undergoing spt were randomly assigned to two groups: a test group took 100 mg/day of stfx for five consecutive days, or a control group received scaling and root planing (srp) under local anaesthesia. microbiological  and clinical parameters were examined at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after therapy. results: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia was significantly reduced at 1 month after treatment in  both groups. the median reductions of the bacteria between the baseline and 1 month were 3.08 and 2.54% in the stfx- and srp-treated groups, respectively. both treatments significantly decreased the probing depth at 1 and 3 months compared to the baseline. conclusion: the systemic administration of stfx is effective at  improving periodontal health during spt and could be an alternative to srp for elderly patients who cannot undergo anaesthesia or are at risk of tissue injury.

AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia induce synergistic alveolar bone loss in a mouse periodontitis model.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is strongly associated with chronic periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to tooth loss. fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic pathogen, is thought to promote dental  plaque formation by serving as a bridge bacterium between early- and late-colonizing species of the oral cavity. previous studies have shown that f. nucleatum species synergize with t. forsythia during biofilm formation and pathogenesis. in the present study, we showed that coinfection of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia is more potent than infection with either species alone in inducing nf-kappab activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytic cells and primary murine macrophages. moreover, in a murine model of periodontitis, mixed infection with the two species induces synergistic alveolar  bone loss, characterized by bone loss which is greater than the additive alveolar bone losses induced by each species alone. further, in comparison to the single-species infection, mixed infection caused significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the gingivae and osteoclastic activity in the jaw bones. these data show that f. nucleatum subspecies and t. forsythia synergistically stimulate the host immune response and induce alveolar bone loss  in a murine experimental periodontitis model.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == the relationship between turbidity of mouth-rinsed water and oral health status.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between turbidity of mouth rinsed water and oral health status such as dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status, flow rate of saliva and oral bacteria. materials and methods: subjects were 165 patients who visited the dental hospital, tokyo medical and dental university. oral health status, including dental and periodontal conditions, oral hygiene status and flow rate of saliva, was clinically examined. the turbidity was measured with a turbidimeter.  quantification of fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and total bacteria levels was performed using real-time pcr. the pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to explore the associations between the turbidity and oral health parameters. results: the turbidity showed significant correlations with the number of decayed teeth and deep pockets, the plaque index, extent of tongue coating and fusobacterium spp, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and total bacteria levels. in a multiple regression model, the turbidity was negatively associated with the flow rate of saliva and positively associated with the total number of bacteria (p < 0.001). conclusion: current findings suggested that turbidity of mouth rinsed water could be used as an indicator to evaluate oral health condition and the amount of bacteria in the oral cavity. in addition, the turbiditimeter appeared as a simple and objective device for screening abnormality of oral health condition at chair side as well as community-based research.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of one-stage, full-mouth, ultrasonic debridement in aggressive periodontitis treatment.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study is to assess clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic benefits of amoxicillin/metronidazole (am) when performing full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (fmud) in generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp) treatment. methods: twenty-four gagp patients were divided into two groups: the fmud group (n = 12), which received fmud plus placebo, and the fmud+am group (n = 12), which received fmud and 375 mg amoxicillin plus 250 mg metronidazole for 7 days. the following clinical outcomes were tested: plaque and bleeding on probing indices, pocket probing depth (pd), relative gingival margin  position (gmp), and relative clinical attachment level (cal). total amount of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentration of interleukin (il)-10 and il-1beta were also determined. all clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters were assessed at baseline and at 3 and  6 months post-therapy. the anova/tukey test was used for statistical analysis (alpha = 5%). results: amoxicillin/metronidazole used as an adjunct to the fmud protocol added clinical and microbiologic benefits to gagp treatment (p <0.05). fmud+am groups presented an additional pd reduction in initially deep pds at the  3-month follow-up (3.99 +/- 1.16 mm and 3.09 +/- 0.78 mm for fmud+am and fmud, respectively; p <0.05), a lower number of residual pockets at the 3- and 6-month  follow-ups, and a statistical reduction in amounts of aa (p <0.05). analysis of tf and pg amounts, as well as il-10 and il-1beta gcf concentrations failed to demonstrate a difference between the groups (p >0.05). conclusion: it may be concluded that amoxicillin/metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of fmud in gagp treatment.

TI  == beta-hexosaminidase activity of the oral pathogen tannerella forsythia influences biofilm formation on glycoprotein substrates.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an important pathogen in periodontal disease. previously, we showed that its sialidase activity is key to utilization of sialic acid from a range of human glycoproteins for biofilm growth and initial adhesion. removal of  terminal sialic acid residues often exposes beta-linked glucosamine or galactosamine, which may also be important adhesive molecules. in turn, these residues are often removed by a group of enzymes known as beta-hexosaminidases. we show here that t. forsythia has the ability to cleave glucosamine and galactosamine from model substrates and that this activity can be inhibited by the hexosaminidase inhibitor pugnac (o-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino n-phenyl carbamate). we now demonstrate for the first time that beta-hexosaminidase activity plays a role in  biofilm growth on glycoprotein-coated surfaces because biofilm growth and initial cell adhesion are inhibited by pugnac. in contrast, adhesion to siallo-glycoprotein-coated surfaces is unaltered by pugnac in the absence of sialidase activity (using a sialidase-deficient mutant) or surprisingly on the clinically relevant substrates saliva or serum. these data indicate that beta-hexosaminidase activity has a significant role in biofilm formation in combination with sialidase activity in the biofilm lifestyle of t. forsythia.

TI  == analysis of the cell surface layer ultrastructure of the oral pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == the gram-negative oral pathogen tannerella forsythia is decorated with a 2d crystalline surface (s-) layer, with two different s-layer glycoprotein species being present. prompted by the predicted virulence potential of the s-layer, this study focused on the analysis of the arrangement of the individual s-layer glycoproteins by a combination of microscopic, genetic, and biochemical analyses. the two s-layer genes are transcribed into mrna and expressed into protein in equal amounts. the s-layer was investigated on intact bacterial cells by transmission electron microscopy, by immune fluorescence microscopy, and by atomic force microscopy. the analyses of wild-type cells revealed a distinct square s-layer lattice with an overall lattice constant of 10.1 +/- 0.7 nm. in contrast, a blurred lattice with a lattice constant of 9.0 nm was found on s-layer single-mutant cells. this together with in vitro self-assembly studies using purified (glyco)protein species indicated their increased structural flexibility after self-assembly and/or impaired self-assembly capability. in conjunction with tem analyses of thin-sectioned cells, this study demonstrates the unusual case that two s-layer glycoproteins are co-assembled into a single s-layer. additionally, flagella and pilus-like structures were observed on t. forsythia cells, which might impact the pathogenicity of this bacterium.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to assess subgingival microbiological changes in smokers versus non-smokers presenting severe chronic periodontitis after supragingival periodontal therapy (st). methods: non-smokers (n=10) and smokers (n=10) presenting at least nine teeth with probing pocket depth (ppd) (>/=5 mm), bleeding on probing (bop), and no history of periodontal treatment in  the last 6 months were selected. clinical parameters assessed were plaque index (pi), bop, ppd, relative gingival margin position (rgmp) and relative clinical attachment level (rcal). subgingival biofilm was collected before and 21 days after st. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primer pair, 27f and 1492r. amplified genes were cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. statistical analysis was  performed by student's t and chi-square tests (alpha=5%). results: clinically, st promoted a significant reduction in pi and ppd, and gain of rcal for both groups, with no significant intergroup difference. microbiologically, at baseline, data analysis demonstrated that smokers harbored a higher proportion of porphyromonas  endodontalis, bacteroidetes sp., fusobacterium sp. and tannerella forsythia and a lower number of cultivated phylotypes (p<0.05). furthermore, non-smokers featured significant reductions in key phylotypes associated with periodontitis, whereas smokers presented more modest changes. conclusion: within the limits of the present study, st promoted comparable clinical improvements in smokers and non-smokers with severe chronic periodontitis. however, in smokers, st only slightly affected the subgingival biofilm biodiversity, as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

TI  == sialic acid, periodontal pathogens and tannerella forsythia: stick around and enjoy the feast!
AB  == periodontal pathogens, like any other human commensal or pathogenic bacterium, must possess both the ability to acquire the necessary growth factors and the means to adhere to surfaces or reside and survive in their environmental niche. recent evidence has suggested that sialic acid containing host molecules may provide both of these requirements in vivo for several periodontal pathogens but  most notably for the red complex organism tannerella forsythia. several other periodontal pathogens also possess sialic acid scavenging enzymes - sialidases, which can also expose adhesive epitopes, but might also act as adhesins in their  own right. in addition, recent experimental work coupled with the release of several genome sequences has revealed that periodontal bacteria have a range of sialic acid uptake and utilization systems while others may also use sialic acid  as a cloaking device on their surface to mimic host and avoid immune recognition. this review will focus on these systems in a range of periodontal bacteria with a focus on ta. forsythia.

TI  == evidence for graft colonization with periodontal pathogens in lung transplant recipients. a pilot study.
AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == subgingival microbial consortia and the clinical features of periodontitis in adolescents.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the association between microbial consortia and the clinical features of periodontitis using a multilevel modeling approach. a total of 958 sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis (cases) and 73 controls were microbiologically sampled and clinically examined. associations between each of the clinical parameters clinical attachment, probing depth, supragingival plaque, calculus, bleeding on probing, and each of 18 bacterial species; and between the same clinical parameters and each of two microbial consortia identified, were investigated using mixed-effects regression modeling. higher counts of tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were all statistically significantly associated with higher values of  clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing in the sampled  site, when both case status and between-subject variance were accounted for. higher counts for the consortium comprising the putative periodontopathogens were statistically significantly associated in a dose-response manner with both higher clinical attachment levels and with increased pocket depth. the counts for the consortium predominantly comprising the early-colonizer species were statistically significantly negatively associated with the presence of supragingival calculus, but positively associated with the presence of supragingival plaque. the study demonstrates a relationship between the counts of putative periodontopathogens and clinical attachment levels and probing pocket depths, even for low levels of these clinical parameters.

TI  == ompa-like protein influences cell shape and adhesive activity of tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, a gram-negative fusiform rod, is implicated in several types of oral anaerobic infections. most gram-negative bacteria have ompa-like proteins that are homologous to the ompa protein in escherichia coli. we identified an ompa-like protein in t. forsythia encoded by the tf1331 gene as one of the major proteins by mass spectrometric analysis. two-dimensional, diagonal electrophoresis showed that the ompa-like protein formed a dimeric or trimeric structure via intermolecular disulfide bonds. a biotin labeling experiment revealed that a portion of the protein was exposed on the cell surface, even though t. forsythia possesses an s-layer at the outermost cell surface. using a tf1331-deletion mutant, we showed that the ompa-like protein affected cell morphology. the length of the mutant cell was reduced almost by half. cell swelling was observed in more than 40% of the mutant cells. moreover, the mutant  exhibited decreased adhesion to fibronectin, retarded autoaggregation, and reduced cell surface hydrophobicity. these results suggest that the ompa-like protein in t. forsythia plays an important role in cellular integrity and adhesive function.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == microbiologic findings 1 year after partial- and full-mouth scaling in the treatment of moderate chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the impact on microbiologic variables of full-mouth scaling (fms) and conventional scaling and root planing (csrp) after 12 months. method and materials: in a prospective randomized controlled clinical study, 37 volunteers with moderate chronic periodontitis were treated by fms or by csrp in  two sessions at 4-week intervals. clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline as well as at 6 and 12 months. four subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest sites in premolars and molars at baseline and after 12 months. pooled sample analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for the identification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, the bacterial load of a actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in the csrp group compared to the  fms group (p = .042). in the csrp group, this load decreased significantly (p = .011), leading to similar quantities of a actinomycetemcomitans in both groups. further, significant reductions in frequency were found in the fms group for t forsythia and p gingivalis and in the csrp group for a actinomycetemcomitans and  t denticola. conclusion: the data suggest that both therapy modalities lead to similar effects on target periodontal pathogen species. fms compared to csrp was  not favorable in reduction of periodontopathogens.

TI  == polymicrobial periodontal pathogen transcriptomes in calvarial bone and soft tissue.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are consistently associated with adult periodontitis. this study sought to document the host transcriptome to a p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t.forsythia challenge as a polymicrobial infection using a murine calvarial model of acute inflammation and bone resorption. mice were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia over the calvaria, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised. a murine genechip((r)) array analysis of transcript profiles showed that 6997 genes were differentially expressed in calvarial bones  (p < 0.05) and 1544 genes were differentially transcribed in the inflamed tissues after the polymicrobial infection. of these genes, 4476 and 1035 genes in the infected bone and tissues were differentially expressed by upregulation. biological pathways significantly impacted by the polymicrobial infection in calvarial bone included leukocyte transendothelial migration (ltm), cell adhesion molecules, adherens junction, major histocompatibility complex antigen, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and antigen processing and presentation resulting in inflammatory/cytokine/chemokine transcripts stimulation in bone and soft tissue. intense inflammation and increased activated osteoclasts were observed in calvarias compared with sham-infected controls. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the mrna level of selected genes corresponded with the microarray expression. the polymicrobial infection regulated several ltm and extracellular membrane pathway genes in a manner distinct from mono-infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia. to our knowledge, this is the first definition of the polymicrobially induced transcriptome in calvarial bone and soft tissue in response to periodontal pathogens.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == role of sialidase in glycoprotein utilization by tannerella forsythia.
AB  == the major bacterial pathogens associated with periodontitis include tannerella forsythia. we previously discovered that sialic acid stimulates biofilm growth of t. forsythia, and that sialidase activity is key to utilization of sialoconjugate sugars and is involved in host-pathogen interactions in vitro. the aim of this work was to assess the influence of the nanh sialidase on initial biofilm adhesion and growth in experiments where the only source of sialic acid was sialoglycoproteins or human oral secretions. after showing that t. forsythia can  utilize sialoglycoproteins for biofilm growth, we showed that growth and initial  adhesion with sialylated mucin and fetuin were inhibited two- to threefold by the sialidase inhibitor oseltamivir. a similar reduction (three- to fourfold) was observed with a nanh mutant compared with the wild-type. importantly, these data  were replicated using clinically relevant serum and saliva samples as substrates. in addition, the ability of the nanh mutant to form biofilms on glycoprotein-coated surfaces could be restored by the addition of purified nanh,  which we show is able to cleave sialic acid from the model glycoprotein fetuin and, much less efficiently, 9-o-acetylated bovine submaxillary mucin. these data  show for the first time that glycoprotein-associated sialic acid is likely to be  a key in vivo nutrient source for t. forsythia when growing in a biofilm, and suggest that sialidase inhibitors might be useful adjuncts in periodontal therapy.

TI  == randomized controlled trial assessing efficacy and safety of glycine powder air polishing in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets.
AB  == background: supragingivally applied glycine powder air polishing (supragpap) has  been shown to remove biofilms in shallow periodontal pockets. this study assesses efficacy and safety of subgingivally applied glycine powder air polishing (subgpap) in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis and intraoral porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and tannerella forsythia who completed initial therapy were randomly assigned to receive subgpap in periodontal pockets with probing depths of 4 to 9 mm, supragpap in all other shallow periodontal sites, and at mucous membranes followed by removal of calculus using curets (full-mouth gpap) or scaling and root planing followed by coronal polishing (srp). patients rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate after debridement, and twice daily, for 2 weeks. results: all 30 patients enrolled completed the baseline, day 10, and day 90 visits. subgpap resulted in significantly lower total viable bacterial counts in moderate-to-deep pockets when compared to srp immediately after debridement and at day 10 (p <0.05). total p. gingivalis counts in the oral cavity were significantly reduced after full-mouth gpap compared to srp at day 90 (p <0.05).  patients' comfort levels were high for both treatments. there were no adverse events related to full-mouth gpap. conclusions: the results indicate that subgpap is more efficacious in removing subgingival biofilm in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets than srp. furthermore, full-mouth gpap may result in a beneficial shift of the oral microbiota and appears to be well tolerated.

AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with signs of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with and without periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: oral microorganisms may be involved in the development  of cardiovascular diseases, and porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the periodontal microorganisms that has been found in carotid atheroma. the aim of this work was to study subgingival microorganisms and early carotid lesions in subjects with and without periodontitis. material and methods: eighty-eight subjects with periodontitis and 40 subjects without periodontitis underwent dental examinations in 2003. the presence of the periodontal microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia was analyzed from subgingival plaque using pcr amplification. the common carotid artery was scanned using ultrasound and the calculated intima-media area (cima) was measured. the association between periodontitis, the cima value and the presence of periodontal microorganisms, together with several confounders, was studied in a multiple logistic regression model. results: smoking [odds ratio (or) = 5.64; p = 0.001),  level of education (or = 5.02; p < 0.05) and the presence of p. gingivalis (or =  6.50; p < 0.05) were associated with periodontitis. explanatory factors for the increased cima were periodontitis (or = 4.22; p < 0.05), hypertension (or = 4.81; p < 0.05), high body mass index (or = 5.78; p < 0.01), male gender (or = 3.30; p  < 0.05) and poor socioeconomic status (or = 4.34; p < 0.05). p. nigrescens (or 4.08; p < 0.05) and p. gingivalis (or 7.63; p < 0.01) also appeared as explanatory variables associated with increased cima values. conclusion: this cross-sectional study showed that p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were significantly associated with increased cima values.

TI  == exploring bacterial diversity of endodontic microbiota by cloning and sequencing  16s rrna.
AB  == introduction: the characterization of microbial communities infecting the endodontic system in each clinical condition may help on the establishment of a correct prognosis and distinct strategies of treatment. the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in primary endodontic infections by 16s  ribosomal-rna (rrna) sequence analysis. methods: samples from root canals of untreated asymptomatic teeth (n = 12) exhibiting periapical lesions were obtained, 16s rrna bacterial genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and bacterial diversity was estimated. results: a total of 489 clones were analyzed (mean, 40.7 +/- 8.0 clones per sample). seventy phylotypes were identified of which six were novel phylotypes belonging to the family ruminococcaceae. the mean number of taxa per canal was 10.0, ranging from 3 to 21 per sample; 65.7% of the cloned sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. the most prevalent taxa were atopobium rimae (50.0%), dialister invisus, prevotella oris, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and tannerella forsythia (33.3%). conclusions: although several key species predominate in endodontic samples of asymptomatic cases with periapical lesions, the primary endodontic infection is characterized by a wide bacterial diversity, which is mostly represented by members of the phylum firmicutes belonging to the class clostridia followed by the phylum bacteroidetes.

TI  == tlr2 signaling and th2 responses drive tannerella forsythia-induced periodontal bone loss.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) is a chronic inflammation of the tooth-supporting soft tissue and alveolar bone due to infection by a select group of gram-negative microbes, which leads to tooth loss if untreated. because mice deficient in cd4(+) cells are resistant to infection-induced alveolar bone loss, th cells have been implicated in bone-destructive processes during pd. however, the extent to which different th cell subtypes play roles in pathogenesis or host protection remains to be defined and is likely to vary depending on the dominant microorganism involved. by far, porphyromonas gingivalis is the best-studied periodontal microbe in pd. although the gram-negative anaerobe tannerella forsythia is also a vital contributor to periodontal bone loss, almost nothing is known about immune responses to this organism. previous studies from our laboratory revealed that t. forsythia induces periodontal bone loss in mice and that this bone loss depends on the bacterially expressed bspa protein. in this study, we showed that t. forsythia activates murine apcs primarily through tlr2-dependent signaling via bspa. furthermore, t. forsythia infection causes a pronounced th2 bias, evidenced by t cell expression of il-5, but not ifn-gamma or il-17, in draining lymph nodes. consistently, deficiencies in tlr2 or stat6 result in resistance to t. forsythia-induced alveolar bone loss. thus, tlr2 signaling and th2 cells play pathogenic roles in t. forsythia-induced alveolar bone destruction.

TI  == tannerella forsythia invasion in oral epithelial cells requires phosphoinositide  3-kinase activation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, a gram-negative anaerobe implicated in periodontitis, has been detected within human buccal epithelial cells and shown to invade oral epithelial cells in vitro. we have previously shown that this bacterium triggers  host tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation and actin-dependent cytoskeleton reorganization for invasion. on the bacterial side, the leucine-rich repeat cell-surface bspa protein is important for entry. the present study was undertaken to identify host signalling molecules during t. forsythia entry into human oral and cervical epithelial cells. specifically, the roles of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), rho-family gtpases, cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains and the endocytic protein clathrin were investigated. for this purpose, cell lines were pretreated with chemical inhibitors or small interfering rnas (sirnas) that target pi3ks, rho gtpases, clathrin and cholesterol (a critical component of 'lipid rafts'), and the resulting effects on t. forsythia uptake were determined. our studies revealed that t. forsythia entry is dependent on host pi3k signalling, and that purified bspa protein causes activation of this lipid kinase. bacterial entry also requires the cooperation of host rac1 gtpase. finally, our findings indicate an important role for clathrin and cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains in the internalization process.

TI  == levels of serum immunoglobulin g specific to bacterial surface protein a of tannerella forsythia are related to periodontal status.
AB  == background: tannerella forsythia (tf) is a gram-negative anaerobe implicated in the development of periodontal disease. bacterial surface protein a (bspa) is a surface-expressed and -secreted protein that is recognized as an important virulence factor of tf. this study was undertaken to determine whether tf bspa induces an antibody response in periodontal disease. we hypothesized that serum immunoglobulin (ig)g antibody levels against bspa correlate with the disease of patients. methods: sera were obtained from 100 patients with cardiac disorders and periodontal disease and 73 patients who experienced myocardial infarction but were periodontally healthy. sera samples were assayed for anti-bspa antibody (total igg and igg subtypes) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). antibody levels were measured in elisa units by using an arbitrary patient as a standard. results: a negative correlation was found with bspa-specific total igg  antibody titers and the severity of disease measured as the clinical attachment level (cal) when healthy and diseased groups were analyzed separately (healthy group: [-0.23, correlation value] student's t value [73 degrees of freedom] = 1.99; p = 0.05; diseased group: [-0.21] t [100 degrees of freedom] = 2.12; p = 0.03]). however, there was a positive correlation ([0.18 correlation value] student's t value [173 degrees of freedom] = 2.39; p = 0.017) when healthy and diseased groups were combined. a strong positive correlation ([0.338 correlation  value] student's t value [173 degrees of freedom] = 4.69; p <0.0001) between the  bspa-specific igg titers and periodontal probing depth was observed when healthy  and disease groups were combined. conclusions: data demonstrated that antibodies  to tf bspa were elicited in patients with periodontal disease, and antibody levels were associated with the disease severity. furthermore, data suggested that anti-bspa igg might have a protective function in periodontal disease by minimizing the loss of tooth attachment tissue.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == ozone has been proposed as an adjunct antiseptic in periodontitis therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of gaseous/aqueous ozone, in comparison with that of the established antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), against periodontal microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and parvimonas micra in planktonic or biofilm cultures were exposed, for 1 min, to gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone, chx, or phosphate-buffered saline (control). none of the agents was able to substantially reduce the a. actinomycetemcomitans count in biofilm cultures. in contrast, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. micra could be eliminated by 2% chx or by ozone gas at 53 gm(-3) . significantly greater antimicrobial effects were observed against planktonic cultures than against biofilm-associated bacteria. the rate of killing was influenced by the species of bacteria, and by the type and concentration of agent. there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of aqueous ozone (20 mug ml(-1) ) or gaseous ozone (>/= 4 gm(-3) ) compared with 2% chx but  they were more effective than 0.2% chx. therefore, high-concentrated gaseous and  aqueous ozone merit further investigation as antiseptics in periodontitis therapy. a safe system for applying gaseous ozone into the periodontal pocket that avoids inhalation still needs to be developed.

TI  == effect of periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines on cd46, cd55, and cd59 gene/protein expression by oral epithelial cells.
AB  == membrane-anchored complement regulatory proteins (crps), including cd46, cd55, and cd59, protect host cells from complement attack. in the present study, we investigated whether periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines modulate crp gene/protein expression in human oral epithelial cells. the lipopolysaccharide of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were the most potent for increasing the gene expression of cd55 and cd59, and to a lesser  extent cd46, after a 48-h stimulation. an lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of epithelial cell-surface crp was also demonstrated. the stimulation of epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide was associated with interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 secretion. although these two cytokines had no effect on cd46 and cd55 gene expression in epithelial cells, il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a significant upregulation. the cell-surface expression of crp was also increased by the stimulation of epithelial cells with cytokines. the cd46, cd55,  and cd59 gene/protein expression was upregulated by periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines. it can be hypothesized that, when faced with bacterial challenges and inflammatory conditions associated with  active periodontal sites, oral epithelial cells may respond by increasing crp gene/protein expression to avoid cell lysis by the complement system, which is activated during periodontitis.

AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

AB  == background: microbial agents in root canal systems can induce periodontal inflammation. the aims of this study are to detect anaerobic microorganisms in endodontic-periodontal lesions, determine the genetic diversity among them, and assess the simultaneous colonization of the pulp and periodontal microenvironments by a single clone. methods: twenty-seven teeth of patients with endodontic-periodontal lesions were selected. samples were spread on an agar-blood medium, the detection of each species was performed using a polymerase chain reaction, and the determination of the simultaneous presence of the same species in the microenvironments by one or more clones was determined using arbitrarily primed pcr. results: prevotella intermedia (pi) was the most prevalent species of the colonies in periodontal pockets, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and pi were the more prevalent in root canals. isolates of pi and pg were simultaneously identified in root canals and periodontal pockets. eighteen percent of teeth exhibited the simultaneous colonization by pg, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and porphyromonas endodontalis in the pulp and periodontal microenvironments. the presence of these species was  noted even in niches from which no colonies were isolated. seventeen different genotypes were found in periodontal and pulp sites, with the majority of sites colonized by one or two different genotypes. a high degree of genotype similarity was found for samples of pg isolated from only one site as well as for those isolated from both microenvironments. conclusion: different clones of pi and pg with a high intraspecific genotype similarity were found to colonize the same anatomic sites in endodontic-periodontal infections.

TI  == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

TI  == microbial changes after full-mouth tooth extraction, followed by 2-stage implant  placement.
AB  == background: recent studies showed that qpcr could detect bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis in a low concentration after full-mouth tooth  extraction. this study monitored the microbiota from tooth extraction, over 9 months of full edentulism, up to 1 year after abutment connection. material and methods: ten patients with severe periodontitis were recruited. six months after  tooth extraction, implants were inserted. three to 6 months later, they were connected to abutments. plaque samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, saliva, and subgingival area (teeth/implants) before extraction up to 1 year after abutment connection, and analysed via culture, qpcr, and checkerboard technology. results: a reduction in the total amount of aerobic and anaerobic cfu/ml was observed. the concentration of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (qpcr and checkerboard) in the saliva and, to a lower extent, on the tongue dorsum reduced. for prevotella intermedia, changes were negligible and no  changes could be detected for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the pristine subgingival niches were quickly colonized by key pathogens. their final concentration remained low, while the detection frequencies remained very high over time. conclusion: complete edentulation results in a significant reduction of bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis, with the exception of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, which might indicate that key pathogens can survive without pockets.

TI  == oral health behaviors, periodontal disease, and pathogens in preeclampsia: a case-control study in korea.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to confirm the association among oral health behaviors, periodontitis, and preeclampsia in korean women. methods: this study is designed as a case-control study. sixteen women with preeclampsia and 48 without preeclampsia post-delivery were included in this study from november 2007 to january 2010. information was collected on demographics, health behaviors, and obstetric and systemic diseases that may influence the periodontal condition and  preeclampsia. full-mouth periodontal probing was conducted by one trained examiner (khb). localized periodontitis was defined as periodontal clinical attachment loss (al) >/= 3.5 mm on two or three sites not on the same tooth. in addition, generalized periodontitis was defined as clinical al >/= 3.5 mm on >/=  4 sites not on the same tooth. gingival crevicular fluid was collected using a sterilized paper point for quantitative analysis of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis). results: after adjusting for confounders, the adjusted odds ratio (or) was 4.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.02 to 29.72) for localized periodontitis and 6.60 (95% ci: 1.25 to 41.61) for generalized periodontitis. in addition, the proportion of floss or interdental brush users in women with preeclampsia was lower than that in women without (adjusted or: 0.21;  95% ci: 0.02 to 0.93). pi was significantly more prevalent in women with preeclampsia (p = 0.028). conclusion: these results indicate that preeclampsia could be associated with the maternal periodontal condition and interdental cleaning.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == a hybrid two-component system of tannerella forsythia affects autoaggregation and post-translational modification of surface proteins.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a gram-negative oral anaerobe closely associated with both periodontal and periapical diseases. the orf tf0022 of strain atcc 43037 encodes a hybrid two-component system consisting of an n-terminal histidine kinase and a c-terminal response regulator. disruption of the tf0022 locus enhanced autoaggregation of the broth-cultured cells. comparative proteome analyses revealed that two s-layer proteins in the tf0022 mutant exhibited decreased apparent masses by denaturing gel electrophoresis, suggesting a deficiency in post-translational modification. furthermore, the mutant decreased  the production of a glycosyltransferase encoded by tf1061 that is located in a putative glycosylation-related gene cluster. quantitative real-time pcr revealed  reduced transcription of tf1061 and the associated genes in the tf0022 mutant. these results indicate that tf0022 upregulates the expression of the glycosylation-related genes and suggest modulation of the autoaggregation of t. forsythia cells by a possible post-translational modification of cell-surface components.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with periodontal pathogens specifically enhances microrna mir-146a in apoe-/- mice during experimental periodontal disease.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are periodontal pathogens associated with the etiology of adult periodontitis as polymicrobial infections. recent studies demonstrated that oral infection with p. gingivalis induces both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic and proatherogenic apoe(-/-) mice. in this study, we explored the expression of micrornas (mirnas) in maxillas (periodontium) and spleens isolated from apoe(-/-) mice infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a polymicrobial infection. mirna expression levels, including mirna mir-146a, and associated mrna expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) were measured in the maxillas and spleens from mice infected with periodontal pathogens and compared to those in the maxillas and spleens from sham-infected controls. furthermore, in response to these periodontal pathogens (as mono- and polymicrobial heat-killed and live bacteria), human thp-1 monocytes demonstrated similar mirna expression patterns, including that of mir-146a, in vitro. strikingly, mir-146a had a negative correlation with tnf-alpha secretion in vitro, reducing levels of the adaptor kinases il-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak-1) and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6). thus, our studies revealed a persistent association of mir-146a expression with these periodontal pathogens, suggesting that mir-146a may directly or indirectly modulate or alter the chronic periodontal pathology induced by these microorganisms.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == use of quantitative pcr to evaluate methods of bacteria sampling in periodontal patients.
AB  == periodontal disease is associated with specific periodontal pathogens and may persist as gingivitis or progress to more severe disease. the bacteria involved in disease initiation and progression have not been identified. we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to compare the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, and total bacteria detected by different sampling methods. on the basis of the results of clinical examinations, 57 patients were divided into 3 groups: healthy group (group a), gingivitis group (group b), and periodontitis group (group c). bacterial samples were collected from saliva, mouthwash, and by paper-point sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and the samples were analyzed with quantitative pcr targeting 16s rrna. the numbers of total bacteria in samples of  gcf, saliva, and mouthwash were 10(5) to 10(6), 10(8), and 10(7), respectively, per milliliter. the number of p. gingivalis in gcf samples was lower than 10 in group a; however, in groups b and c, the values were 10(3) and 10(4), respectively, indicating that the number of p. gingivalis increased with worsening clinical status. findings were similar in the samples of saliva and mouthwash. the numbers of t. forsythia showed a pattern similar to that of p. gingivalis in all 3 samples. these results suggest that saliva and mouthwash samples are clinically useful for bacterial testing of periodontal diseases by quantitative pcr. in addition, mouthwash sampling is more feasible and straightforward than saliva sampling.

TI  == association of three bacterial species and periodontal status in chinese adults:  an epidemiological approach.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are oral pathogens associated with periodontitis. the association between these three bacteria and periodontal disease has been reported in populations of many countries. however, corresponding data in chinese populations are still lacking. the aim of this study was to detect these pathogens in subgingival plaque collected from 468 subjects with chronic periodontitis in a group of chinese adults by using a pcr method and to determine the degree of association between the target bacteria and periodontal status based on logistic  regression analysis. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia were found in 20.5%, 70.7%, and 77.1% of the subjects, respectively. about one-third (36.1%) of subjects had chronic periodontitis. upon univariate analysis, age, male gender, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis were positively associated with chronic periodontitis, whereas education and income exhibited inverse associations with chronic periodontitis. upon multivariate analysis, education, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis  remained significant. the adjusted odds ratios for having chronic periodontitis were 2.5 and 3.4 in subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, respectively. however, no significant association was observed between the presence of t. forsythia and periodontal status. this study assesses  the prevalence of periodontal pathogens and chronic periodontitis and the associations with sociodemographic characteristics among this group of chinese adults. these findings also suggest that pcr should be considered for field oral  epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations presenting major logistic challenges.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == virulence of major periodontal pathogens and lack of humoral immune protection in a rat model of periodontal disease.
AB  == objective: this study was designed to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis are synergistic in terms of virulence potential using a model of mixed-microbial infection in rats.  materials and methods: three groups of rats were infected orally with either t. forsythia or p. gingivalis in mono-bacterial infections or as mixed-microbial infections for 12 weeks and a sham-infected group were used as a control. this study examined bacterial infection, inflammation, immunity, and alveolar bone loss changes with disease progression. results: tannerella forsythia and p. gingivalis genomic dna was detected in microbial samples from infected rats by pcr indicating their colonization in the rat oral cavity. primary infection induced significantly high igg, igg2b, igg1, and igg2a antibody levels indicating activation of mixed th1 and th2 immune responses. rats infected with the mixed-microbial consortium exhibited significantly increased palatal horizontal and interproximal alveolar bone loss. histological examinations indicated significant hyperplasia of the gingival epithelium with moderate inflammatory infiltration and apical migration of junctional epithelium. the results observed  differ compared to uninfected controls. conclusion: our results indicated that t. forsythia and p. gingivalis exhibit virulence, but not virulence synergy, resulting in the immuno-inflammatory responses and lack of humoral immune protection during periodontitis in rats.

TI  == a quantitative proteomic analysis of biofilm adaptation by the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a gram-negative anaerobe that is one of the most prominent inhabitants of the sub-gingival plaque biofilm, which is crucial for causing periodontitis. we have used itraq proteomics to identify and quantify alterations in global protein expression of t. forsythia during growth in a biofilm. this is the first proteomic study concentrating on biofilm growth in this key periodontal pathogen, and this study has identified several changes in protein expression. moreover, we introduce a rigorous statistical method utilising peptide-level intensities of itraq reporters to determine which proteins are significantly regulated. in total, 348 proteins were identified and  quantified with the expression of 44 proteins being significantly altered between biofilm and planktonic cells. we identified proteins from all cell compartments,  and highlighted a marked upregulation in the relative abundances of predicted outer membrane proteins in biofilm cells. these included putative transport systems and the t. forsythia s-layer proteins. these data and our finding that the butyrate production pathway is markedly downregulated in biofilms indicate possible alterations in host interaction capability. we also identified upregulation of putative oxidative stress response proteins, and showed that biofilm cells are 10 to 20 fold more resistant to oxidative stress. this may represent an important adaptation of this organism to prolonged persistence and immune evasion in the oral cavity.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia or their combinations in subgingival samples at the initial diagnosis and after periodontal therapy. periodontal sites with probing depths between 5-7  mm and clinical attachment level between 5-10 mm, from 53 subjects with chronic periodontitis, were sampled in four periods: initial diagnosis (t0), immediately  (t1), 45 (t2) and 60 days (t3) after scaling and root planing. bana test and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization identified red complex species in the subgingival biofilm. in all experimental periods, the highest frequencies of score 2 (checkerboard dna-dna hybridization) for p. gingivalis, t. denticola and  t. forsythia were observed when strong enzymatic activity (bana) was present (p < 0.01). the best agreement was observed at initial diagnosis. the bana test sensitivity was 95.54% (t0), 65.18% (t1), 65.22% (t2) and 50.26% (t3). the specificity values were 12.24% (t0), 57.38% (t1), 46.27% (t2) and 53.48% (t3). the bana test is more effective for the detection of red complex pathogens when the bacterial levels are high, i.e. in the initial diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

AB  == objective: the purpose of the present study was to characterize the collagenolytic activity in a sonicated extract of tannerella forsythia and to investigate the activation of prommmp-2 and -9 by the t. forsythia extract. methods: the t. forsythia extract was incubated with type i collagen. the cleaved products were then analyzed by sds-page using the method of laemmli. we studied the effects of cysteine, dtt, cacl(2), and various proteinase inhibitors on collagenolytic activity. a ht1080 cell culture supernatant containing prommp-2 and -9 was incubated with the t. forsythia extract and analyzed for the activation of prommp-2 and -9 by gelatin zymography. results: the t. forsythia extract degraded type i collagen. cysteine increased the collagenolytic activity  of the extract, and 5mm cacl(2) was required for this activity. the collagenolytic activity of t. forsythia was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, edta, and leupeptin, but not by pmsf, e-64, tlck, or tpck. when prommp-2 and -9 were incubated with the t. forsythia extract, gelatinases with the relative molecular masses of mmp-2 and -9 were produced. conclusion: the present study suggests that t. forsythia extract is able to degrade type i collagen and activate prommp-2 and -9.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria and herpesviruses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease involves complex interactions of microorganisms and host defenses. this work investigated the associations between putative bacterial pathogens, herpesviruses and chronic periodontitis. subgingival samples were collected from 40 periodontally healthy individuals and from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis with probing depths of < or =3 mm or > or =6 mm. multiplex  and nested polymerase chain reactions were used to identify bacterial pathogens and herpesviruses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, cytomegalovirus (cmv), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  and ebv type 2 were detected in, respectively, 95, 75, 72.5, 50, 12.5 and 10% of  sites with probing depths > or =6 mm. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, ebv-1 and cmv  were statistically associated with probing depths > or =6 mm. a. actinomycetemcomitans and ebv-2 showed no association with periodontitis sites, and no significant associations were found for any of the test infectious agents  and probing depths < or =3 mm. our results confirm an association between p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, ebv-1 and cmv, and chronic periodontitis. these infectious agents may play an important synergistic role in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis.
AB  == periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. although it  is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that  prevents the host from developing disease. however, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host  defence mechanisms. furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. here, i describe the interaction of the host immune system with the  oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

TI  == periodontitis associated with chediak-higashi syndrome in a young african american male.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic  disease. the primary defect is abnormal granule formation in the cells secondary  to a mutation of a lysosomal trafficking regulator protein. chs patients have immune system abnormalities, bleeding abnormalities, and multiple infections including periodontitis. methods: a 13-year-old african american male presented with severe gingival inflammation, generalized gingival bleeding, and tooth looseness. comprehensive dental, medical and laboratory evaluations were performed. results: all teeth exhibited excessive mobility. the gingival tissues  were swollen and bled easily. most sites had probing depth in excess of 10 mm. dental radiographs showed advanced generalized alveolar bone loss. areas of skin  depigmentation were noted. blood smear showed presence of intracellular large granules in white blood cells. platelet function was altered. gingival histopathology showed an intense chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and presence of numerous filamentous bacteria. subgingival microbiological culture showed the presence of porphyromonas gingvalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia. based on the periodontal, medical and laboratory findings a diagnosis of chs was established. because of the advanced periodontal condition and the risk of fatal bacterial infections, exodontias were performed. because of platelet abnormalities the patient developed postoperative bleeding complications that required management with coagulation factor 7. conclusions: advanced periodontitis is an important symptom of chs and may be the first step in the diagnosis of the condition. due to the weakened immunity of chs patients, periodontal management is usually unsuccessful. tooth extractions are recommended to eliminate the periodontal problems and reduce the risk of fatal bacterial infections.

TI  == periodontal disease-associated micro-organisms in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women using or not using hormone replacement therapy. a two-year  follow-up study.
AB  == background: despite conflicting results on the use of hormone replacement therapy (hrt) there is no doubt that many women benefit from it. women using hrt are known to be more health conscious in general with putative positive implications  in the mouth. however, we observed recently in our cohort hardly any difference in oral health status between hrt-users and non-users. there are only a few studies about hrt and oral microbiota. we hypothesized that counts of periodontal micro-organisms are lower in health-conscious hrt-users than non-users. methods:  two-year open follow-up study was conducted on originally 200 hrt-users and 200 non-users from age cohorts of 50-58 years. after clinical examination pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analyses. the results of finally 135 women meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed with cross-tabulation and chi-square test. explanatory factors were studied by step-wise logistic regression analysis. results: in hrt group, the numbers of positive samples for porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis, p < 0.07), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia, p < 0.05)and tannerella forsythia (t. forsythia, p < 0.01) decreased in women with >or= 4-mm-deep pockets. respectively in hrt users with >or= 6-mm-deep pockets the numbers of positive samples for p. gingivalis (p < 0.05) and t. forsythia (p < 0.01) were decreased. no corresponding differences were observed in the non-hrt group. in logistic regression, the existence of deep periodontal pockets explained the majority of cases harboring specific micro-organisms in both groups. conclusion: although use of hrt did not correlate with periodontal health status, hrt led to decreasing numbers of positive samples of the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. further studies with longer observation time are needed to observe the clinical relevance of the results.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

TI  == dna from porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia induce cytokine production in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) expression is increased in periodontally diseased tissues compared with healthy sites indicating a possible role of tlr9 and its ligand, bacterial dna (bdna), in periodontal disease pathology. here, we determine the immunostimulatory effects of periodontal bdna in human monocytic cells (thp-1). thp-1 cells were stimulated with dna of two putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. the role of tlr9 in periodontal bdna-initiated cytokine production was determined either by blocking  tlr9 signaling in thp-1 cells with chloroquine or by measuring il-8 production and nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation in hek293 cells stably transfected with human tlr9. cytokine production (il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha)  was increased significantly in bdna-stimulated cells compared with controls. chloroquine treatment of thp-1 cells decreased cytokine production, suggesting that tlr9-mediated signaling pathways are operant in the recognition of dna from  periodontal pathogens. compared with native hek293 cells, tlr9-transfected cells  demonstrated significantly increased il-8 production (p < 0.001) and nf-kappab activation in response to bdna, further confirming the role of tlr9 in periodontal bdna recognition. the results of pcr arrays demonstrated upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and nf-kappab genes in response to periodontal bdna in thp-1 cells, suggesting that cytokine induction is through nf-kappab activation. hence, immune responses triggered by periodontal bacterial nucleic acids may contribute to periodontal disease pathology by inducing proinflammatory cytokine production through the tlr9 signaling pathway.

TI  == synergistic effects of lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in an ex vivo whole blood model.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. this disease is characterized by  an accumulation of inflammatory cells in periodontal tissue and subgingival sites. the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines by those cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of whole blood from periodontitis patients following challenges with whole cells of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia or their lipopolysaccharides (lps), individually and in combination. whole blood collected from seven periodontitis patients was stimulated with whole cells or lps and the production of interleukin (il)-1beta,  il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the mono and mixed challenges with whole bacterial cells or lps induced the secretion of high amounts of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha by the mixed leukocyte population from periodontitis patients. in addition, p. gingivalis lps, t. denticola lps, and t. forsythia lps  acted in synergy to induce high levels of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study suggests that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may contribute to the immunodestructive host response characteristic of periodontitis through synergistic effects of their lps on the inflammatory response induced by a mixed  population of leukocytes.

TI  == short-term effects of systemic antibiotics during periodontal healing.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the short-term effects of nonsurgical therapy (scaling and root planing, srp) on the subgingival microbiota in chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontal disease. method and materials: ninety-seven cp and ap subjects underwent full-mouth srp on 2 consecutive days. ap patients were randomly assigned to either receive systemic metronidazole plus amoxicillin (ap+ab) or were treated mechanically alone (ap). pathogens were identified with 16s rrna oligodeoxynucleotide probes and dot-blot hybridization before and at days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 21 of healing. cp subjects were treated by scaling and root planing along with placebo tablets. results: initially, ap cell counts were  69.9- (porphyromonas gingivalis), 10.2- (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans),  5.7- (tannerella forsythia), and 3.3-fold (prevotella intermedia) enhanced compared to cp cell counts. following srp, immediate elimination occurred in single individuals of all three treatment groups at day 2. after srp plus antibiotic therapy (ap+ab), the prevalence scores dropped beyond the levels of ap and cp, beginning at day 7, and remained low until day 21 (p =or< .05). clinical  healing statistically benefited from srp with no differences among the three treatment groups. conclusion: nonsurgical therapy resulted in both a suppression  and early elimination of single taxa immediately after completion of active treatment. systemic antibiotics significantly accelerate the suppression of the periodontal microflora, but have limited effect on the elimination of target isolates during healing.

TI  == a novel sialic acid utilization and uptake system in the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a key contributor to periodontitis, but little is known of its virulence mechanisms. in this study we have investigated the role of sialic acid in biofilm growth of this periodontal pathogen. our data show that biofilm growth of t. forsythia is stimulated by sialic acid, glycolyl sialic acid, and sialyllactose, all three of which are common sugar moieties on a range  of important host glycoproteins. we have also established that growth on sialyllactose is dependent on the sialidase of t. forsythia since the sialidase inhibitor oseltamivir suppresses growth on sialyllactose. the genome of t. forsythia contains a sialic acid utilization locus, which also encodes a putative inner membrane sialic acid permease (nant), and we have shown this is functional  when it is expressed in escherichia coli. this genomic locus also contains a putatively novel tonb-dependent outer membrane sialic acid transport system (tf0033-tf0034). in complementation studies using an escherichia coli strain devoid of its outer membrane sialic acid transporters, the cloning and expression of the tf0033-tf0034 genes enabled an e. coli nanr nanc ompr strain to utilize sialic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. we have thus identified a novel sialic acid uptake system that couples an inner membrane permease with a tonb-dependent outer membrane transporter, and we propose to rename these novel sialic acid uptake genes nano and nanu, respectively. taken together, these data  indicate that sialic acid is a key growth factor for this little-characterized oral pathogen and may be key to its physiology in vivo.

TI  == comparison of periodontal pathogens between cats and their owners.
AB  == the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are strongly associated with periodontal disease and are highly prevalent in humans with periodontitis. porphyromonas and tannerella spp. have also been isolated from the oral cavity of cats. the oral microflora in animals was compared with those in humans in earlier studies, but no studies are available on the comparison of the oral microflora from pets and their respective owners. the aim  of this study was to determine the presence of these bacteria in the oral microflora of cats and their owners, since animal to human transmission, or vice  versa, of oral pathogens could have public health implications. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gulae, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia in the oral microflora of cats and their owners, using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). all porphyromonas isolates from cats (n=64) were catalase positive, whereas the porphyromonas isolates from owners (n=7) were catalase negative, suggesting that the isolates from cats were p. gulae whereas those from the owners were p. gingivalis. t. forsythia was recovered from both cats (n=63) and owners (n=31); the proportion of t. forsythia relative to the total cfu was higher in cats with periodontitis than in cats without periodontal  disease. genotyping of t. forsythia isolates (n=54) in six cat/owner couples showed that in one cat/owner couple the t. forsythia isolates (n=6) were identical. these t. forsythia isolates were all catalase positive, which led us to hypothesize that transmission from cats to owners had occurred and that cats may be a reservoir of t. forsythia.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == antibacterial and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralising activity of human cationic antimicrobial peptides against periodontopathogens.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of eight antimicrobial  peptides (amps), comprising four human beta-defensins (hbds), three human neutrophil defensins (hnps) and the cathelicidin ll-37, against two representative periodontopathogens, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia. the neutralising effect of these amps on expression of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) from p. intermedia and t. forsythia was also tested in thp-1 cells and human gingival fibroblasts. prevotella intermedia was susceptible to hbd-3 and ll-37 but was resistant to hbd-1, hbd-2, hbd-4, hnp-1, hnp-2 and hnp-3 at concentrations up to 10microm. however, all of the amps except hnp-2 at  5microm significantly inhibited the expression of il-1beta, il-8 and icam-1 induced by p. intermedia lps. tannerella forsythia showed marked susceptibility to the amps tested in the following order: ll-37, hbd-3, hbd-2, hbd-1, hnp-1 and  hbd-4. all of the amps except hnp-3 had significant neutralising effects on t. forsythia lps activity. the amps showing lps-neutralising activity inhibited lps  binding to the cells. these results suggest that amps may be considered as preventive and therapeutic agents against mixed bacterial infections such as periodontitis by eliminating the pathogens themselves as well as reducing the activity of lps.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == do periodontopathogens disappear after full-mouth tooth extraction?
AB  == aim: to monitor the intra-oral microbiological changes after full-mouth extraction using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). material and methods: nine patients with severe, aggressive periodontitis, for whom a full-mouth tooth extraction was the only remaining treatment option were recruited. before and 6 months after extraction, microbial samples were obtained  (tongue, saliva and subgingival plaque) and analysed by qpcr. results: the elimination of subgingival niches, by extraction of all natural teeth, resulted in a 3-log reduction of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and more modest reductions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia. however, the detection frequencies of these periodontopathogens in saliva and on the tongue remained unchanged after full-mouth tooth extraction. conclusion: in contrast to what has been believed so far, full-mouth tooth extraction does not result in eradication of all periodontopathogens but only in  a significant reduction. the clinical consequences of this observation remain speculative.

TI  == oral microbiota of children in a school-based dental clinic.
AB  == objectives: dental caries disproportionately affects disadvantaged subjects. this study hypothesized that there were greater caries extent and higher levels of caries-associated and anaerobic subgingival bacterial species in oral samples of  hispanic and immigrant children compared with non-hispanic and us born children.  methods: children from a school-based dental clinic serving a community with a large hispanic component were examined, and the extent of caries was recorded. microbial samples were taken from teeth and the tongues of children. samples were analyzed using dna probes to 18 oral bacterial species. results: seventy five children were examined. extent of caries increased with child age in immigrant, but not in us born or hispanic children. there were no differences in the microbiota based on ethnicity or whether the child was born in us or not. there was a higher species detection frequency from teeth than tongue samples. levels of streptococcus mutans and other streptococcus spp increased with caries extent. prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and selenomonas spp were detected at  low levels in these children. conclusions: we conclude that, while there was a high rate of dental caries in disadvantaged school children, there were no differences in the caries-associated microbiota, including s. mutans, based on ethnicity or immigration status. furthermore, while anaerobic subgingival, periodontal pathogens were also detected in children, there was no difference in  species detection based on ethnicity or immigration status. increased levels of streptococci, including s. mutans, however, were detected with high caries levels. this suggested that while it is beneficial to target preventive and treatment programs to disadvantaged populations, there is likely no additional benefit to focus on subgroups within a population already at high risk for dental disease.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in primary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are anaerobic bacteria commonly involved in root canal infections. although previous investigations have assessed these species by strictly qualitative approaches, accurate determination of their cell levels by a sensitive quantitative technique may contribute with additional information regarding relevance in pain of endodontic origin. method: the root canal levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  and total bacteria were investigated by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (pcr) assay based on unique copy molecular markers. a total of 32 symptomatic (n  = 14) and asymptomatic (n = 18) cases of endodontic infections were analyzed. root canal samples were collected; genomic dna was extracted and submitted to sybr green i real-time pcr targeting the rgpb (p. gingivalis), bspa (t. forsythia), and rpob (total bacteria) single copy genes. results: overall, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and the coexistence of both species were encountered in 28%, 66%, and 22% of the subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels ranged from 5.65 x 10(-6) to 1.20 x 10(-2) and from 5.76 x 10(-6) to 1.35  x 10(-1). t. forsythia was highly prevalent and numerous in the study groups, whereas p. gingivalis was moderately frequent and less abundant, displaying 19-fold lower average levels than the former. conclusions: the endodontic levels  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, individually or in conjunction, did not display significant associations with the manifestation of pain of endodontic origin.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == tannerella forsythia detected in infected root canals using nested pcr.
AB  == purpose: this study assessed the occurrence of tannerella forsythia in patients with acute and chronic primary endodontic infections. methods: clinical samples were collected from 40 patients with acute and chronic periradicular disease. nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay technique was used to detect the presence of t. forsythia in primary endodontic infections. the first round of pcr amplification used universal primers to detect the 16s rdna sequence. product from the first round was then used to amplify t. forsythia specific fragment with species-specific pairs of primers. results: t. forsythia was found in 12 of 27 chronic and 5 of 13 acute infected patients for an overall occurrence frequency of 42.5%. no significant correlation was found between patients with the t. forsythia positive genotype and the occurrence of clinical symptoms in the primary endodontic infections (p < 0.05) (p = 0.496). also, no significant relationship was found between the occurrence of t. forsythia and the patient's age (p = 0.61) or gender (p = 0.239).

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

TI  == salivary interleukin-1beta concentration and the presence of multiple pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to find salivary enzymes and/or cytokines that would reflect periodontitis, alone or in combination with salivary microbial markers. material and methods: the salivary concentrations of elastase, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and the presence of five periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, were analysed from salivary specimens of 165 subjects, a subpopulation of health 2000 health examination survey in finland; 84 of the subjects had probing pocket depth (ppd) of > or =4 mm at 14 or more teeth (the advanced periodontitis group), while 81 subjects had  no teeth with ppd of > or =4 mm (the control group). all subjects had at least 20 teeth and no systemic diseases. results: among the salivary cytokines and enzymes tested, il-1beta was the only biomarker associated with periodontitis. an association was also found with the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens. salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens were associated with periodontitis at the same magnitude, when they were in the logistic regression model individually or together. conclusion: we suggest that salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens in saliva should be studied more thoroughly as markers of periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == t-rflp-based mcra gene analysis of methanogenic archaea in association with oral  infections and evidence of a novel methanobrevibacter phylotype.
AB  == introduction: increasing evidence suggests a role for methanogenic archaea (methanogens) in human health and disease via syntrophic interactions with bacteria. here we assessed the prevalence and distribution of methanogens and possible associations with bacteria in oral biofilms. methods: forty-four periodontal and 32 endodontic samples from necrotic teeth with radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis were analysed. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis based on the mcra gene, specific to methanogens, was applied. the prevalence and amounts of methanogens in endodontic samples were compared with those of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema spp. and synergistes spp. based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. results: besides dominance of the mcra gene corresponding to methanobrevibacter oralis, one mcra gene type, for which no cultivated member has been reported previously, was identified in five periodontal samples and one endodontic sample. rates of non-synonymous vs. synonymous nucleotide substitutions suggest that this mcra gene type codes for a  functionally active methyl-coenzyme m reductase. methanobrevibacter smithii, the  prominent methanogen in the human gut system, was not detected. mean proportions  of methanogens were comparable to synergistes spp. ranging from 0.5 to 1.0% of the total microbial community. treponema spp. dominated with a mean proportion of 10%, while the mean proportions of the other endodontic pathogens were below 0.1%. a positive association between methanogens and synergistes spp. was found.  conclusion: our data provide evidence of a novel, as yet uncultured methanogenic  phylotype in association with oral infections, and indicate possible interactions between methanogens and synergistes spp., the nature of which deserves further investigation.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == the oxyr homologue in tannerella forsythia regulates expression of oxidative stress responses and biofilm formation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic periodontal pathogen that encounters constant oxidative stress in the human oral cavity due to exposure to air and reactive oxidative species from coexisting dental plaque bacteria as well as leukocytes. in this study, we sought to characterize a t. forsythia orf with close similarity to bacterial oxidative stress response sensor protein oxyr. to analyse the role of this oxyr homologue, a gene deletion mutant was constructed and characterized. aerotolerance, survival after hydrogen peroxide challenge and  transcription levels of known bacterial antioxidant genes were then determined. since an association between oxidative stress and biofilm formation has been observed in bacterial systems, we also investigated the role of the oxyr protein  in biofilm development by t. forsythia. our results showed that aerotolerance, sensitivity to peroxide challenge and the expression of oxidative stress response genes were significantly reduced in the mutant as compared with the wild-type strain. moreover, the results of biofilm analyses showed that, as compared with the wild-type strain, the oxyr mutant showed significantly less autoaggregation and a reduced ability to form mixed biofilms with fusobacterium nucleatum. in conclusion, a gene annotated in the t. forsythia genome as an oxyr homologue was  characterized. our studies showed that the oxyr homologue in t. forsythia constitutively activates antioxidant genes involved in resistance to peroxides as well as oxygen stress (aerotolerance). in addition, the oxyr deletion attenuates  biofilm formation in t. forsythia.

TI  == relationship of neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival  microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) dysfunctions have been associated with severe forms of periodontitis. this study evaluated the correlation between pmn phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival microbiota of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). methods: heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained from 18 gagp patients and 11 periodontally healthy (ph) subjects, and pmns were isolated on a ficoll-hypaque gradient. for phagocytosis analysis, pmns were incubated with fluorescein-labeled staphylococcus aureus. the oxidative burst was evaluated by incubation of pmns with dihydroethidium and activation by s. aureus. the assays were examined using  flow cytometry. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from periodontal sites  with and without periodontitis and 24 species were detected by checkerboard. results: a significantly lower phagocytosis rate was observed for patients with gagp compared with ph subjects over time (p < 0.05). no differences between groups were found for superoxide production. gagp patients presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b than controls (p < 0.05). significant negative correlations between t. forsythia and p. gingivalis and pmn functions were observed. conclusions: gagp subjects presented diminished phagocytic activity of peripheral pmns and high prevalence and levels of classical periodontal pathogens.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis with either tannerella forsythia or treponema denticola  induces synergistic il-6 production by murine macrophage-like j774.1 cells.
AB  == background: chronic periodontitis is caused by mixed bacterial infection. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are frequently detected in deep periodontal pockets. we demonstrate that these bacteria induce proinflammatory cytokine production by the mouse macrophage-like  cell line j774.1. materials and methods: j774.1 cells were incubated with and without bacteria for 24h in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. the culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for secreted mouse interleukin (il)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. the cytokine concentrations were determined using a standard curve prepared for each assay. results: mixed infection with p.  gingivalis and either t. forsythia or t. denticola at 10(5)cfu/ml acted synergistically to increase il-6 production, but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. gingipain  inhibitors kyt-1 and kyt-36 inhibited il-6 production by j774.1 cells incubated with 10(5)cfu/ml of mixed bacteria. conclusion: these results suggest that p. gingivalis with either t. forsythia or t. denticola directly induces synergistic  il-6 protein production and that gingipains play a role in this synergistic effect.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == alendronate augments interleukin-1beta release from macrophages infected with periodontal pathogenic bacteria through activation of caspase-1.
AB  == nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (nbps) are anti-bone-resorptive drugs with inflammatory side effects that include osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis of the jaw. oral bacteria have been considered to be a trigger for these nbp-associated  jaw bone diseases. the present study examined the effects of alendronate (a typical nbp) and clodronate (a non-nbp) on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, which are important pathogens of periodontal diseases. pretreatment with alendronate augmented il-1beta, but not tnfalpha, production by macrophages  infected with p. gingivalis or t. forsythia. this augmentation of il-1beta production was inhibited by clodronate. furthermore, caspase-1, a promoter of il-1beta production, was activated by treatment with alendronate, and caspase-1 inhibitor reduced the production of il-1beta induced by alendronate and p. gingivalis. these results suggest that nbps augment periodontal pathogenic bacteria-induced il-1beta release via caspase-1 activation, and this phenomenon may contribute to the development of nbp-associated inflammatory side effects including jaw osteomyelitis. co-treatment with clodronate may prevent and/or reduce these inflammatory effects induced by nbps.

TI  == differences in subgingival microflora of korean and german periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == periodontal and microbiologic evaluation of 2 methods of archwire ligation: ligature wires and elastomeric rings.
AB  == introduction: prophylactic programs to prevent dental biofilm accumulation must be implemented to minimize the risk for periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients. therefore, we assessed the possible periodontal and microbiologic changes resulting from the use of 2 methods of orthodontic archwire ligation: elastomeric rings and steel ligatures. methods: the following parameters were measured: plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, and biofilm samples from the maxillary second premolars and the mandibular lateral incisors were evaluated in 14 subjects without clinical signs of gingival inflammation before orthodontic appliance placement and after 6 months of treatment. each orthodontic arch was fixed with elastomeric rings on 1 side of the midline, and steel ligatures were used on the opposite side. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and p nigrescens. results: the elastomeric rings were associated with a higher score for plaque index and bleeding than steel ligatures, as well as many positive sites of t forsythia and p nigrescens (p <0.05). conclusions: elastomeric rings favored these 2 periodontopathogens and harmed gingival conditions.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == bacterial colonization of oral implants from nondental sources.
AB  == implants showing signs of peri-implantitis harbor a microbiota similar to that of periodontitis-affected teeth. this case report describes the subgingival microbiota of a 45-year-old female with advanced periodontitis before and after complete edentulation and reconstruction with dental implants. a 3-month healing  period post extraction passed before implants were placed using a two-stage submerged implant protocol. at 4- to 6-month recall visits after definitive prosthetic reconstruction, some implant sites showed bleeding on probing and localized mucositis. microbiological culture of three inflamed peri-implant sites showed an almost identical spectrum of pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and other major pathogenic bacteria characteristic of aggressive periodontitis. as natural teeth were absent for 8 months, this case report suggests that periodontal pathogens can be retained for  a prolonged period of time in nondental sites, from where they can later colonize and compromise the health of dental implants. the therapeutic implications of this finding are discussed.

TI  == periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis: a clinical, microbiological and immunological study.
AB  == aim: to clinically, microbiologically and immunologically characterize periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis. material and methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with a probing pocket depth (ppd) of >or=5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to quadrant-wise scaling and root planing or one session of full-mouth periodontal debridement. the following clinical outcomes were assessed: plaque index, bop, position of gingival margin,  relative attachment level (ral) and ppd. real-time pcr was used for quantitative  analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay permitted the detection of il-1beta, prostaglandin e(2), inf-gamma and il-10 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). all the parameters were evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. results: both the groups had similar means of ppd reduction and attachment gain over time. besides a significant reduction in the bacterial level after treatment in both groups, microbiological analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences between them. finally, no difference was observed between groups with respect to the levels of inflammatory mediators in gcf. conclusion: periodontal debridement resulted in a similar clinical, microbiological and immunological outcome when compared with standard scaling and root planing and therefore may be a viable approach to deal with severe chronic periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and laboratory evaluations of non-surgical periodontal treatment in subjects with diabetes mellitus.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory changes 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing in subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. methods: this study was performed using 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who required insulin therapy (dm) and 10 healthy adult control subjects (ndm) with generalized chronic periodontal disease. both groups were treated with full-mouth scaling and root planing and given oral hygiene instructions. clinical parameters, including plaque index (pi), gingival  index (gi), probing depth (pd), gingival recession (gr), and clinical attachment  level (cal), were measured at four sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from sites with the deepest pd (> or =5 mm) and with furcations in  each subject. samples were also tested for the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) by polymerase chain reaction. glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [hba1c] and fasting glucose levels) and clinical and microbiologic assessments were recorded at baseline and 3 months after periodontal treatment. results: data revealed statistical changes (p < or =0.05; analysis of variance [anova]) in clinical variables (pi, gi, pd, gr, and cal) between baseline and 3 months in both groups. conversely, no improvement in the fasting glucose level or glycosylated hemoglobin (p < or =0.05; anova) was found after treatment. besides  some reduction in the bacterial frequency 3 months after treatment, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. conclusion: clinical and laboratory responses were similar in dm and ndm groups 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == this report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. we hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. the results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmp), demonstrated  significant differences among the various age groups of animals. levels of many of these were increased with age, although pge(2), rantes, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (bpi), mmp-1, and mmp-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those  for the older animals. we observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of  the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. the levels of antibodies, particularly those to porphorymonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of  the age of the animal. these results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. the findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.

TI  == antibody levels to single bacteria or in combination evaluated against myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls,  but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated  (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa,  anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == occurrence of herpes simplex virus 1 and three periodontal bacteria in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp.
AB  == viral and bacterial associations appear to be implicated in the development of periodontal infections. little information is available describing the periodontopathic agents in root canals with necrotic pulp. in this study, the occurrence and the combinations among herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp were evaluated. clinical samples from healthy subjects and patients with periodontal or pulp infections were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction pcr to detect hsv and pcr to detect the 3 periodontal bacteria. the presence of tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was observed in healthy, periodontitis, and necrotic pulp patients. hsv was observed in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients, and no healthy subject harbored d. pneumosintes or hsv. the occurrence of tannerella forsythia was not statistically significant in patients with necrotic pulp (p = 0.704). periodontal bacteria were observed varying from 10.3% to 20.7% in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients. the presence of treponema denticola - hsv association was predominant in patients showing necrotic pulp (24.1%); however, hsv alone was observed in one patient with periodontitis and in another  patient with necrotic pulp. the presence of double association among bacteria or  bacteria - hsv could indicate a role in both periodontitis and necrotic pulp, and tannerella forsythia - treponema denticola - hsv and tannerella forsythia - d. pneumosintes - treponema denticola - hsv associations might be important in periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological determinants of ailing dental implants.
AB  == background: the failure of the host tissue to establish or maintain osseointegration around dental implants is due to either occlusal or parafunctional forces, premature loading, ill-directed stress, or microbial infection. the long-term failure rate of dental implants is generally 5-10%. although a variety of etiologies of early peri-implant bone loss (from implant placement to 1-year post-loading) have been proposed, factors associated with late implant failures are less well understood but are probably related to both the peri-implant microbial environment and host factors. discriminating between causes of implant failure is of importance for instituting a successful implant therapy. purpose: the objective of this cross-sectional split-mouth study was to  identify clinical, radiographic, and bacterial characteristics of peri-implant disease sites. materials and methods: fifteen patients with bilateral implants (branemark, nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden; and 3i implant systems, implant innovations inc., palm beach gardens, fl, usa) participated in the study. sites with peri-implant (radiographic bone loss beyond the third implant thread) and peri-implant healthy tissues (radiographic bone level above the first implant thread) were identified in periapical radiographs using a long-cone paralleling projection technique. microbiological identification was carried out using established anaerobic culture techniques. a descriptive statistics based on means and standard deviations was reported. results: peri-implant bone loss was associated with the absence of radiographic crestal lamina dura, peri-implant pocket depth, pain on chewing, and the submucosal presence of the putative periodontopathogens tannerella forsythia, campylobacter species, and peptostreptococcus micros. pain was associated with p. micros, fusobacterium species, and eubacterium species. discussion and conclusion: the absence of radiographic crestal lamina dura and the presence of suspected major periodontal  pathogens seem to be associated to peri-implantitis.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == etiological analysis of initial colonization of periodontal pathogens in oral cavity.
AB  == it is unclear when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity. therefore, we report here the association between specific age groups and the time when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity in such groups. findings are based on an epidemiological analysis of the prevalence of five periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of  a wide range of age populations, from newborn to elderly, who were randomly selected in a geographic region of brazil. these periodontal pathogens include campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia and were analyzed in the bacterial samples isolated from gingival sulcus, the dorsum of the tongue, and cheek mucosa of diverse age groups, using a bacterial dna-specific pcr method. results indicated that there are distinct age-related groups where initial colonization by the five periodontal pathogens examined in this study can be detected and that the presence of teeth is a permissive factor  for colonization by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia. although it remains unclear exactly how or when target pathogens colonize healthy subjects, an understanding of age-related groups does provide a potentially useful tool in  the early detection and prevention of periodontitis in healthy individuals.

TI  == increased interleukin-18 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: this study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (il-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with gingivitis. a secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. methods: gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five gingivitis sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five gingivitis sites from 15 patients with gingivitis. samples from each site category were pooled and il-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites from patients with periodontitis and gingivitis. the total amount of il-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than gingivitis sites in both periodontitis (p = 0.018) and gingivitis (p = 0.002) patients and was higher in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients than in those from gingivitis patients (p = 0.015). there were higher levels of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites in both the periodontitis and gingivitis patients (p < 0.001). conclusion: levels of il-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis, even at sites with similar pocket depths. the presence of similar levels of red complex species in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients and from gingivitis patients suggested that the higher levels of il-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.

TI  == uncultivated tannerella bu045 and bu063 are slim segmented filamentous rods of high prevalence but low abundance in inflammatory disease-associated dental plaques.
AB  == uncultivated clones bu045 and bu063 and tannerella forsythia, a 'consensus periodontal pathogen', are the closest known relatives within the genus tannerella. they have been described to inhabit different ecological niches of the human oral cavity. in this study, fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and immunofluorescence were combined to investigate the prevalence and abundance  of bu045 and bu063 in comparison to t. forsythia in plaques from gingivitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug) and chronic periodontitis. phylotype-specific fish probes identified bu045 and bu063 as elongated thin rods  with a segmented structure. two structurally similar and previously unknown, rare phylotypes (127+ and 997+) were also identified due to partial 16s rrna sequence  identity with t. forsythia. in gingivitis, nug and periodontitis patients, bu045, bu063, 127+, 997+ and t. forsythia were detected with prevalences of 50/83/71/14  and 81%, 100/100/86/17 and 53%, and 100/100/12/0 and 100%, respectively. supragingivally, colonization density of all five organisms was generally low, rarely exceeding 0.1% of the total biota. in periodontal pocket samples, however, cell numbers of t. forsythia, but not of the uncultivable phylotypes, were greatly elevated. our data demonstrate that tannerella phylotypes bu045, bu063, 127+ and 997+ consist of long slim rods with segments, which, with respect to fish stainability, often behaved as independent units. the phylotypes are frequent but low-level colonizers of various periodontal disease-associated plaques. their apparent inability to proliferate to high density seems to exclude any relevance for the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == prevalence of fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis and periodontal health status in chinese adults.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae play a key role in colonization of the oral cavity. the fima gene, which encodes fimbrillin (fima),  can be classified into six types (i-v and ib) according to nucleotide sequence. in the present study, we investigated the relationship between the prevalence of  p. gingivalis-specific fima genotypes and periodontal health status in chinese adults. material and methods: one-hundred and fifteen patients with chronic periodontitis and 136 periodontally healthy adults were selected. p. gingivalis detection, determination of fima genotypes, and the co-existence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia with various fima types, were assessed by the polymerase chain reaction. odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for associating the fima-specific genes with periodontitis. results: p. gingivalis was detected in 22.1% of healthy subjects and in 81.7% of the patients. a single fima genotype was detected in most samples. in healthy adults, the most prevalent fima genotype was type i (66.7%).  however, type ii was detected most frequently (43.6%) in the patient group, followed by type iv (30.9%). the frequency of co-existing a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia was highest in type ii fima-positive sites. statistical analysis revealed that periodontitis was associated with occurrences of type i (odds ratio 0.97), ib (odds ratio 13.26), ii (odds ratio 36.62), iii (odds ratio 4.57), iv (odds ratio 22.86) and v (odds ratio 1.19). conclusion: p. gingivalis type ii followed by type iv were considered as disease-associated strains that account for the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis in chinese adults.

AB  == background: the objective of this trial was to measure the antimicrobial effects  of a minocycline hcl microsphere (mm) local drug-delivery system when used as an  adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). dna probe analysis for 40 bacteria was used to evaluate the oral bacteria of 127 subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. methods: subjects were randomly assigned to either srp alone (n = 65) or mm + srp (n = 62). the primary endpoints of this study were changes in numbers and proportions of the red-complex bacteria (rcb) and the sum  of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formally t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola relative to 40 oral bacteria at each test site from baseline  to day 30. numbers of rcb from the five test sites were averaged to provide a value for each subject. results: mm + srp reduced the proportion of rcb by 6.49%  and the numbers by 9.4 x 10(5). the reduction in rcb proportions and numbers by srp alone (5.03% and 5.1 x 10(5), respectively) was significantly less. in addition, mm + srp reduced probing depth by 1.38 mm (compared to 1.01 mm by srp alone), bleeding on probing was reduced by 25.2% (compared to 13.8% by srp alone), and a clinical attachment level gain of 1.16 mm (compared to 0.80 mm by srp alone) was achieved. conclusion: these observations support the hypothesis that rcbs are responsible for periodontal disease and that local antimicrobial therapy using mm + srp effectively reduces numbers of rcbs and their proportions  to a greater extent than srp alone.

AB  == background: information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. aims: (1) to assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. results: comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of veillonella parvula (p<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. included among these bacteria at implant sites were porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.05), tannerella forsythia, (p<0.01), and treponema denticola (p<0.001). immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored staphylococcus aureus. comparing tooth and  implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. this difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. conclusions: bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

TI  == persistently high levels of periodontal pathogens associated with preterm pregnancy outcome.
AB  == background: few studies examining the association between periodontal diseases and preterm birth have explored the underlying microbial and antibody responses associated with oral infection. methods: a nested case-control study was performed using data from a recent interventional trial following the delayed-treatment control group of 31 subjects with periodontal diseases. the levels of eight oral bacteria and the maternal immunoglobulin g (igg) responses in serum to these bacteria were measured at antepartum and postpartum visits to determine the relationship to cases (preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation) and controls (term delivery). results: antepartum, the levels of periodontal pathogens tended to be higher in the preterm (case group) deliveries compared to  the term deliveries (control group). maternal anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to the term group (p = 0.028). postpartum, levels of p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were statistically significantly higher in  preterm births compared to term deliveries, adjusting for baseline levels. the joint effects of red and orange microbial clusters were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term group. conclusions: high levels of periodontal pathogens and low maternal igg antibody response to periodontal bacteria during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery. further studies elucidating the role of the microbial load and maternal immune response as related to pregnancy outcome seem merited.

TI  == role of a tannerella forsythia exopolysaccharide synthesis operon in biofilm development.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a gram-negative oral anaerobe implicated in the development of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bacterial infections which leads to tooth loss if untreated. since biofilms formed by periodontal bacteria are considered important in disease progression and pose difficulties in treatment, we sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms of  t. forsythia biofilm formation. this was carried out by screening random insertion mutants of t. forsythia for alterations in biofilm development. this approach lead to the identification of an operon involved in exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. an isogenic mutant of one of the genes, wecc, contained within the operon was constructed. the isogenic wecc mutant showed increased ability to  form biofilms as compared to the parent strain. the wecc mutant also formed aggregated microcolonies and showed increased cell-surface associated hydrophobicity as compared to the parent strain. moreover, biochemical characterization of the wecc mutant indicated that glycosylation of surface glycoproteins was reduced. therefore, our results suggest that the wecc operon is associated with glycosylation of surface-glycoprotein expression and likely plays an inhibitory role in t. forsythia biofilm formation.

AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == periodontal and oral microbiological status of an adult population undergoing haemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == inflammation associated with implants with different surface types.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. methods: three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. the transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type a), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type c) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type d). the control was a standard machined surface (type b). in order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. at 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were  obtained. the area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating  cell types were determined using immunohistology. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. results: inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. t cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. in all lesions the cd4 : cd8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. statistical analysis showed that the type c surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type b surface (machined surface without a groove; p<0.05). no statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of  infiltrating cells. however, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque  was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. all implants had similar numbers of tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. conclusions: these results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of  plaque. the different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate,  with t cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. however, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == oral bacteria in plaque and invading buccal cells of young orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: in this longitudinal study, patients with fixed orthodontic appliances served as models to determine whether actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and total streptococci increased after treatment, and whether treatment affected bacterial invasion into the adjacent buccal epithelial cells (bec). methods: supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and bec were collected from 27 patients before and at least 4 weeks after placement of orthodontic fixed appliances. total sample dna was determined, and bacteria were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  the bec were also examined by confocal microscopy after fluorescent in-situ hybridization to visually detect the presence of each species bacteria in bec. results: total dna in supragingival and subgingival plaque increased after appliance placement (p = .005). there was also a significant increase in supragingival streptococci (p = .0002). by confocal microscopy, a trend toward fewer buccal cells recovered was found after appliance placement, and there was a significant increase in the percentage of buccal cells containing a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = .0058). conclusions: appliance placement appeared to increase buccal cell susceptibility to a. actinomycetemcomitans invasion. this might be due to physical trauma or to leaching of metals from the appliances.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated mexican subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and aim: specific microbial profiles that may distinguish between generalized aggressive-periodontitis (gagp) and generalized chronic-periodontitis (gcp) have, to date, not been described. the purpose of the present study was to  describe the subgingival microbial composition of mexican subjects with gagp and  compare it with that of individuals with gcp and periodontal health (ph). material and methods: seventy-seven subjects with gagp (n=19), gcp (n=39) and ph  (n=19) were selected. clinical measurements included plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. up to 28 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each subject and analysed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: gagp and gcp subjects harboured significantly higher levels and/or proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (levels: p<0.001, proportion: p<0.01), prevotella nigrescens (p<0.05 levels) and "red" complex species (p<0.001 proportion) than ph subjects. all gagp subjects were carriers of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens. no significant differences in any of the 40 microbial species  tested were detected between gagp and gcp subjects. conclusions: our results revealed that the microbial differences between gagp and gcp subjects were only discrete and none of the bacterial species tested seemed to specifically differentiate the subgingival microbial profile of either periodontitis group.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == [pathogenic potential of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, the red bacterial complex associated with periodontitis].
AB  == periodontitis are mixed bacterial infections leading to destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, including periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. among over 500 bacterial species living in the oral cavity, a bacterial complex named "red complex" and made of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia has been strongly related to advanced periodontal lesions. while periodontopathogenic bacteria are the primary etiologic factor of periodontitis, tissue destruction essentially results from the host immune response to the bacterial challenge. members of the red complex are gram negative anaerobic bacteria expressing numerous virulence factors allowing bacteria to colonize the subgingival sites, to disturb the host defense system, to invade and destroy periodontal tissue as well as to promote the immunodestructive host response. this article reviews current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of  bacteria of the red complex leading to tissue and alveolar bone destruction observed during periodontitis.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles enhance attachment, and the leucine-rich repeat bspa protein is required for invasion of epithelial cells by "tannerella forsythia".
AB  == the human oral cavity harbors more than 500 species of bacteria. periodontitis, a bacterially induced inflammatory disease that leads to tooth loss, is believed to result from infection by a select group of gram-negative periodontopathogens that includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and "tannerella forsythia" (opinion on name change from tannerella forsythensis pending; formerly bacteroides forsythus). epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses. further, the epithelial cells with invading bacteria also serve as reservoirs important in recurrent infections. the present study was therefore undertaken to address the epithelial cell adherence and invasion properties of t. forsythia and the role of the cell surface-associated protein bspa in these processes. further, we were interested in determining if p. gingivalis, one of the pathogens frequently found associated in disease, or its outer membrane vesicles (omvs) could modulate the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia. here we show that epithelial cell attachment and invasion by t. forsythia are dependent on the bspa protein. in addition, p. gingivalis or its omvs enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia to epithelial cells. thus, interactions between these two bacteria may play important roles in virulence by promoting host cell attachment and invasion.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == subgingival and tongue microbiota during early periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal infections have a microbial etiology. association of species with early disease would be useful in determining which microbes initiate periodontitis. we hypothesized that the microbiota of subgingival and tongue samples would differ between early periodontitis and health. a cross-sectional evaluation of 141 healthy and early periodontitis adults was performed with the use of oligonucleotide probes and pcr. most species differed in associations with sample sites; most subgingival species were associated with subgingival samples.  few species were detected more frequently in early periodontitis by dna probes. porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (tannerella forsythensis) were  associated with early periodontitis by direct pcr. in conclusion, the microbiota  of tongue samples was less sensitive than that of subgingival samples in detecting periodontal species, and there was overlap in species detected in health and early periodontitis. detection of periodontal pathogens in early periodontitis suggests an etiology similar to that of more advanced disease.

TI  == identification and characterization of the genes encoding a unique surface (s-) layer of tannerella forsythia.
AB  == a newly emerged periodontopathic pathogen tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), a gram-negative, filament-shaped, strict anaerobic, non-pigmented oral bacterium, possesses a surface (s-) layer. in our previous studies, the s-layer has been isolated, and shown to mediate hemagglutination, adhesion/invasion of epithelial cell, and murine subcutaneous abscess formation.  in the present study, biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of the s-layer are reported. amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry indicated that  the s-layer is composed of two different proteins, termed 200 and 210 kda proteins. it was also shown that these proteins are glycosylated. the genes encoding the core proteins of these glycoproteins, designated as tfsa and tfsb, have been identified in silico, cloned, and their sequences have been determined. the tfsa (3.5 kb) and tfsb (4.1 kb) genes are located in tandem, and encode for 135 and 152 kda proteins, respectively. an apparent discrepancy in molecular weights, 135 vs. 200 kda and 152 vs. 210 kda, is accounted for carbohydrate residues attached to the core proteins. amino acid sequence comparison exhibited  a 24% similarity between the 200 and 210 kda proteins. further sequence analyses  showed that tfsa and tfsb possess putative signal peptide sequences with cleavage sites at alanine residues, and transmembrane domains on the c-terminal region. northern blot and rt-pcr analyses confirmed an operon structure of tfsab, suggesting co-regulation of these genes in producing the s-layer. putative promoter sequences and transcription termination sequences for this operon have also been identified. comparison with database indicates that the s-layer of t. forsythia has a unique structure exhibiting no homology to other known s-layers of prokaryotic organisms. the present study shows that the t. forsythia s-layer is very unique, since it appears to be composed of two large glycoproteins, and it does not reveal any homology to other known s-layer proteins or glycoproteins  of prokaryotic organisms.

AB  == background: of the many forms of periodontal disease, refractory periodontal diseases are the least characterized. they are defined as the continued degeneration of the periodontium despite adequate management. this has led to the suggestion that there may be a systemic component that is a contributing factor to the development of this condition. the objectives of this report were to follow the progression of clinical changes associated with periodontal disease over a number of years in this unique population and review various hematologic and microbiologic factors that may be contributing to the disease progression. methods: three subjects were profiled. they were referred to the refractory periodontal disease unit at the university of toronto by periodontists or general practitioners in the southern ontario region. complete medical and dental histories were obtained along with baseline clinical measurements. periodontal examinations were facilitated with the use of a computer-assisted periodontal probe. a microbiologic analysis using immunofluorescence techniques was able to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and spirochetes. a hematologic analysis, including a complete blood count (cbc), immune profile, and glycosylated hemoglobin assay, was also performed. results: the clinical presentation revealed that patients receiving adequate maintenance therapy and with good to excellent oral hygiene demonstrated sites with continual loss of attachment. few periodontal pathogens were detected. however, the most significant finding appeared to be the report elevated levels of cd8+ cells within this group of patients compared to normal laboratory ranges. conclusions: this report is an attempt at characterizing a unique population within the periodontal realm. the long-term monitoring of these patients allowed for an assessment of factors that  may be involved in the continued decline of the periodontal health of these patients. based on the immune profile, it is possible that a hyperresponsive state may be the primary feature of this population. future assessments, including full-mouth interleukin (il)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 levels, may assist in characterizing this population further, with the goal of producing markers that will assist clinicians in predicting treatment outcome.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == supportive periodontal therapy using mechanical instrumentation or 2% minocycline gel: a 12 month randomized, controlled, single masked pilot study.
AB  == objective: to compare the short-term performance of subgingival local delivery of 2% minocycline gel and conventional subgingival debridement in supportive periodontal therapy (spt) patients. methods: forty adult patients having completed active treatment for moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis were included in a randomized, controlled, single masked maintenance care pilot study. sites with residual pocket probing depths > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing were treated with either minocycline gel (minocycline-group) or scaling and root planing only (debridement-group) at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  results: full-mouth plaque and bleeding scores remained <10% and <20%, respectively, for both groups throughout the study. in both groups there was a persistent reduction in number of teeth and sites with probing pocket depths > or =5 mm (p<0.05) with no significant differences between the groups. the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, remained at levels < or =10(5) in the majority of patients and sites  in both groups. conclusion: this pilot study failed to show a difference between  local delivery of 2% minocycline gel as mono-therapy and traditional subgingival  debridement in patients on spt.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == the distribution of tannerella forsythia in an adolescent and adult population.
AB  == background: the fact that tannerella forsythia, an important periopathogen, is difficult to cultivate from mixed infections has impeded precise estimates of its distribution within a given population. in order to discern t. forsythia alone from the mixed infection of plaque, the use of sensitive 16s ribosomal rna based  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection is necessary. objectives: the aim of the present study was to determine the distribution of t. forsythia in an adult and in an adolescent population. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 498 australian adults and from 228 adolescent subjects from manchester, uk. tannerella forsythia was detected using pcr and confirmed by restriction analysis. semi-quantitation of the organisms was carried out using two specific primers of differing sensitivities. results: in the adolescent population, 25% were found to carry t. forsythia, albeit in relatively low numbers. in the adult population, a total of 37.8% and 11% were found to carry the organism with primer 2 and primer 1, respectively, suggesting that around 27% had between 10(3) and 10(7) organisms. although there was an apparent increased proportion of t. forsythia positive subjects in those aged > or = 50 years, this  was not statistical significant. however, t. forsythia positive male smokers showed increased disease severity compared with t. forsythia negative subjects. conclusion: this study has shown that at least 25% of the adolescent population carry low numbers of t. forsythia, whereas at least 37% of adults carry the organism, with some 11% having relatively high numbers. the relationship between  t. forsythia and disease progression in these populations, however, remains to be determined.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == contact-dependent regulation of a tannerella forsythia virulence factor, bspa, in biofilms.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is one of the periodontal organisms implicated in the development of periodontal diseases. the surface associated and secreted protein, bspa (encoded by the bspa gene), of this bacterium is an important virulence factor. the present study was carried out to examine the regulation of the bspa gene during biofilm growth and contact stimuli encountered in interbacterial interactions. the expression levels of the bspa transcript were determined by real-time rt-pcr approach. the levels of bspa transcript were found to be significantly reduced as a result of contact stimulus and in biofilm cells relative to planktonic cells. the results of our study suggest that the likely downregulation of the bspa protein in biofilms and following contact may have implications in pathogenesis as a plausible mechanism of evasion of host immune responses.

TI  == detection of periodontopathic bacteria and an oxidative stress marker in saliva from periodontitis patients.
AB  == we assessed the salivary levels of periodontopathic bacteria and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in patients with periodontitis. the salivary levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus) were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. the 8-ohdg levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the salivary levels of 8-ohdg, p. gingivalis,  and t. forsythia in the periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. by contrast, the a. actinomycetemcomitans level in healthy subjects was higher than that in periodontitis patients. 8-ohdg was significantly correlated with p. gingivalis. statistically significant decreases  in the levels of p. gingivalis, probing depth, bleeding on probing, and 8-ohdg were observed after initial periodontal treatment. these results suggest that the 8-ohdg levels in saliva reflect the load of periodontal pathogens. 8-ohdg could be a useful biomarker for assessing periodontal status accurately, and for evaluating the efficacy of periodontal treatment.

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), a novel nucleic acid amplification method, was developed for the rapid detection of the major periodontal pathogens  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. the lamp method amplifies dna with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity. in this study, we initially designed the primers for lamp assays to detect these bacteria and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. the specificities of the primers for these bacteria were examined using various oral bacteria and various reaction times. the lower detection limits of the 60-min lamp reaction without loop primers were 1 microg/tube for p. gingivalis, 10 fg/tube for t. forsythia, and 1  ng/tube for t. denticola. addition of the loop primers for each bacterium improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes. furthermore, lamp assays were applied to the rapid detection of these periodontal pathogens in clinical specimens, and the results were compared with those of conventional pcr detection. the results of the lamp assays corresponded to those  of conventional pcr assays. these results indicate that the lamp assay is an extremely rapid, highly sensitive, specific method. this method is very useful for the rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria and the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

TI  == tannerella forsythia-induced alveolar bone loss in mice involves leucine-rich-repeat bspa protein.
AB  == tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus) is one of the periodontal pathogens recently implicated in the development of periodontal disease. the cell-surface-associated, as well as the secreted, leucine-rich-repeat protein (bspa) of this bacterium have been suggested to play roles in bacterial adherence, and also in inflammation, by triggering release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and chemokines from osteoblasts, leading to inflammation and bone resorption. in this study, we sought to determine the pathogenic potential of t. forsythia and the in vivo role of the bspa protein in pathogenesis in the mouse model of infection-induced alveolar bone loss. the results showed alveolar bone loss in mice infected with the t. forsythia wild-type strain, whereas the bspa mutant was impaired. in conclusion, evidence is presented in support of t. forsythia as an important organism involved in inducing alveolar bone loss, and the bspa protein is an important virulence factor of this bacterium.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == synergy between tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm formation.
AB  == during dental plaque formation, the interaction of different organisms is important in the development of complex communities. fusobacterium nucleatum is considered a 'bridge-organism' that facilitates colonization of other bacteria by coaggregation-mediated mechanisms and possibly by making the environment conducive for oxygen intolerant anaerobes. these studies were carried out to determine whether coaggregation between f. nucleatum and tannerella forsythia is  important in the formation of mixed species biofilms. further, the role of bspa protein, a surface adhesin of t. forsythia, in coaggregation and biofilm formation was investigated. the results showed the development of synergistic mixed biofilms of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia when these bacteria were cocultured. the bspa protein was not involved in biofilm formation. though bspa plays a role in coaggregation with f. nucleatum, presumably other adhesins are also involved. the synergistic biofilm formation between the two species was dependent on cell-cell contact and soluble components of the bacteria were not required. this study demonstrates that there is a positive synergy between f. nucleatum and t. forsythia in the development of mixed biofilms and that the cell-cell interaction is essential for this phenomenon.

TI  == immunohistological analysis of tannerella forsythia-induced lesions in a murine model.
AB  == tannerella forsythia has been implicated as a defined periodontal pathogen. in the present study a mouse model was used to determine the phenotype of leukocytes in the lesions induced by subcutaneous injections of either live (group a) or nonviable (group b) t. forsythia. control mice (group c) received the vehicle only. lesions were excised at days 1, 2, 4, and 7. an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to stain infiltrating cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, cd14+ macrophages, cd19+ b cells, and neutrophils. hematoxylin and eosin sections demonstrated lesions with central necrotic cores surrounded by neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in both group a and group b mice. lesions from control mice exhibited no or only occasional solitary leukocytes. in both groups  a and b, neutrophils were the dominant leukocyte in the lesion 1 day after injection, the numbers decreasing over the 7-day experimental period. there was a relatively low mean percent of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the lesions and, whereas  the percent of cd8+ t cells remained constant, there was a significant increase in the percent of cd4+ t cells at day 7. this increase was more evident in group  a mice. the mean percent of cd14+ macrophages and cd19+ b cells remained low over the experimental period, although there was a significantly higher mean percent of cd19+ b cells at day 1. in conclusion, the results showed that immunization of mice with live t. forsythia induced a stronger immune response than nonviable organisms. the inflammatory response presented as a nonspecific immune response with evidence of an adaptive (t-cell) response by day 7. unlike porphyromonas gingivalis, there was no inhibition of neutrophil migration.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interrelationships in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: recent findings have begun to provide a basis for a causal link between herpesviruses and aggressive periodontitis. one theory is that herpesviruses cooperate with specific bacteria in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. this study examined whether the presence of herpesviruses [human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, herpes simplex virus (hsv) type 1 and 2] is associated with the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia,  campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in aggressive periodontitis lesions. methods: the study included 18 young adults with advanced  periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy subjects from ankara, turkey. subgingival specimens pooled from two sites in each subject were collected by a periodontal curette. qualitative polymerase chain reaction methodology was used to identify herpesviruses and bacteria. chi-square tests were employed to determine statistical associations among herpesviruses, bacteria and periodontal  disease. results: hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were each detected in 72-78% of the aggressive periodontitis patients. hsv-2 occurred in 17% of the periodontitis patients. ebv-1 was detected in one periodontally healthy subject. the study bacteria occurred in 78-83% (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus) and in 44% (p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the periodontitis samples, and in 0-19% of the samples from healthy periodontal sites. hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were positively associated with p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and c. rectus, but not with a. actinomycetemcomitans. hsv-2 was not associated with any  test bacteria. conclusions: these results support the notion that the clinical outcome of some types of severe periodontal infection depends on the presence of  specific herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens. our findings open the door to testing a variety of hypotheses regarding the deleterious aspects of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections in periodontal sites.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.
