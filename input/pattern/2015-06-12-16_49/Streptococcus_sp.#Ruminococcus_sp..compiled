TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Description of development of rumen ecosystem by PCR assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  - This study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. Five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (T30), weaned lambs slaughtered at 45 days (T45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (T90). At slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the genes encoding 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA of the rumen bacterial and protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (Prevotella ruminicola, Streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (Entodinium sp.). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. Intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial DNA (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas pH declined. In milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. Thereafter, in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of R. flavefaciens decreased and R. albus increased. Amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of P. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and S. bovis was the least abundant species. Protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from Entodinium and subfamily Isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. Lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (Entodinium and subfamily Diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.
TI  - Isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  - One hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a hay-grain ration. Before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings were counted. Calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of attached bacteria also occurred. Nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Most of these types were represented among the isolates. Characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including Butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), Bacteroides sp. (22.4%), Selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), Streptococcus bovis (8.1%), Propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), Treponema sp. (3.1%), and Eubacterium sp., Lachnospira multiparus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5% each). Eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. L. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. All S. bovis strains and two strains each of Bacteroides sp. and Butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. Bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (R. J. Wallace, K.-J. Cheng, D. Dinsdale, and E. R. Orskov, Nature (London) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. The term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
