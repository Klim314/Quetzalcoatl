TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == structure of the c-terminal domain of aspa (antigen i/ii-family) protein from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the pathogenic bacteria streptococcus pyogenes can cause an array of diseases in  humans, including moderate infections such as pharyngitis (strep throat) as well  as life threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and puerperal fever. the antigen i/ii family proteins are cell wall anchored adhesin proteins found on the surfaces of most oral streptococci and are involved in host colonization and  biofilm formation. in the present study we have determined the crystal structure  of the c2-3-domain of the antigen i/ii type protein aspa from s. pyogenes m type  28. the structure was solved to 1.8 a resolution and shows that the c2-3-domain is comprised of two structurally similar dev-igg motifs, designated c2 and c3, both containing a stabilizing covalent isopeptide bond. furthermore a metal binding site is identified, containing a bound calcium ion. despite relatively low sequence identity, interestingly, the overall structure shares high similarity to the c2-3-domains of antigen i/ii proteins from streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans, although certain parts of the structure exhibit distinct features. in summary this work constitutes the first step in the full structure determination of the aspa protein from s. pyogenes.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of some thai traditional medical longevity formulations  from plants and antibacterial compounds from ficus foveolata.
AB  == context: medicinal plants involved in traditional thai longevity formulations are potential sources of antimicrobial compounds. objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of some extracts from medicinal plants used in traditional thai longevity formulations against some oral pathogens, including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and candida albicans. an extract that possessed the strongest antimicrobial activity was fractionated to isolate and identify the active compounds. materials and methods: methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of 25 medicinal plants used as thai longevity formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion (5 mg/disc) and broth microdilution (1.2-2500 microg/ml) methods. the ethyl acetate extract of ficus foveolata wall. (moraceae) stems that exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and discussion: the ethyl acetate extract of f. foveolata showed the strongest antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values of 19.5-39.0 and 39.0-156.2 microg/ml, respectively. on the basis of an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, seven antibacterial compounds, including 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (1), syringaldehyde (2), sinapaldehyde (3), coniferaldehyde (4), 3beta-hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one (5), umbelliferone (6), and scopoletin (7), were purified. among these isolated compounds, 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (1) exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against s. pyogenes, s. mitis, and s. mutans with mic values of 7.8, 7.8, and 15.6 microg/ml, and mbc values of 7.8, 7.8, and 31.2 microg/ml, respectively. in addition, this is the first report of these antibacterial compounds in the stems of f. foveolata.

TI  == a conserved streptococcal membrane protein, lsrs, exhibits a receptor-like function for lantibiotics.
AB  == streptococcus mutans strain gs-5 produces a two-peptide lantibiotic, smb, which displays inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including other streptococci. for inhibition, lantibiotics must recognize specific receptor molecules present on the sensitive bacterial cells. however, so far no such receptor proteins have been identified for any lantibiotics. in this study, using a powerful transposon mutagenesis approach, we have identified in streptococcus pyogenes a gene that exhibits a receptor-like function for smb. the protein encoded by that gene, which we named lsrs, is a membrane protein belonging to the caax protease family. we also found that nisin, a monopeptide lantibiotic, requires lsrs for its optimum inhibitory activity. however, we found that lsrs is not required for inhibition by haloduracin and galolacticin, both of which are two-peptide lantibiotics closely related to smb. lsrs appears to be a well-conserved protein that is present in many streptococci, including s. mutans. inactivation of smu.662, an lsrs homolog, in s. mutans strains ua159 and v403 rendered the cells refractory to smb-mediated killing. furthermore, overexpression of lsrs in s. mutans created cells more susceptible to smb. although lsrs and its homolog contain the caax protease domain, we demonstrate that inactivation of the putative active sites on the lsrs protein has no effect  on its receptor-like function. this is the first report describing a highly conserved membrane protein that displays a receptor-like function for lantibiotics.

TI  == photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
AB  == photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the  cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against  the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.

TI  == a novel gene involved in the survival of streptococcus mutans under stress conditions.
AB  == a streptococcus mutans mutant defective in aciduricity was constructed by random-insertion mutagenesis. sequence analysis of the mutant revealed a mutation in gida, which is known to be involved in trna modification in streptococcus pyogenes. complementation of gida by s. pyogenes gida recovered the acid tolerance of s. mutans. although the gida-inactivated s. pyogenes mutant exhibited significantly reduced expression of multiple extracellular virulence proteins, the s. mutans mutant did not. on the other hand, the gida mutant of s.  mutans showed reduced ability to withstand exposure to other stress conditions (high osmotic pressure, high temperature, and bacitracin stress) besides an acidic environment. in addition, loss of gida decreased the capacity for glucose-dependent biofilm formation by over 50%. this study revealed that gida plays critical roles in the survival of s. mutans under stress conditions, including lower ph.

TI  == a role for the dtxr family of metalloregulators in gram-positive pathogenesis.
AB  == given the central role of transition metal ions in a variety of biochemical processes, the colonization, survival, and proliferation of a bacterium within a  host hinges upon its ability to overcome the metal ion deprivation that characterizes nutritional immunity. metalloregulatory, or 'metal-sensing' proteins have evolved in bacteria to mediate metal ion homeostasis by activating  or repressing the expression of genes encoding metal ion transport systems upon binding their cognate metal ion. yet increasing evidence in the literature supports an additional role for these metalloregulatory proteins in pathogenesis. herein, we survey studies on the dtxr family of metalloregulators, namely dtxr (cornyebacterium diphtheriae), slor (streptococcus mutans), mtsr (streptococcus pyogenes), and mntr (staphylococcus aureus) to describe how metalloregulation enables adaptive virulence gene expression within the mammalian host. this research has important implications for drug design, as the generation of hyper-repressive metalloregulatory proteins may represent a mechanism by which to attenuate bacterial pathogenicity. the fact that metalloregulators are unique to  prokaryotes makes these proteins especially attractive therapeutic targets.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the volatile fractions from leaves and flowers of the wild iraqi kurdish plant prangos peucedanifolia fenzl.
AB  == the volatile fractions isolated from prangos peucedanifolia fenzl leaves and flowers were investigated for their phytochemical composition and biological properties. flower and leaf hydrodistillation afforded 3.14 and 0.49 g of yellowish oils in 1.25 and 0.41% yields, respectively, from dry vegetable materials. according to the gc-fid and gc/ms analyses, 36 (99.35% of the total oil composition) and 26 compounds (89.12%) were identified in the two oils, respectively. the major constituents in the flower volatile fraction were beta-pinene (35.58%), alpha-pinene (22.13%), and beta-phellandrene (12.54%), while m-cresol (50.38%) was the main constituent of the leaf volatile fraction. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against several bacterial and fungal strains, on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by the micro- and macrodilution methods. the two volatile fractions showed moderate antifungal  and antibacterial activities, especially against trichophyton rubrum (mic of 2x10(3) mug/ml), streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus (mic</=1.9x10(3) mug/ml for all).

TI  == microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency  and drug release of microparticles were determined. the antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli). it was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. in vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by fickian diffusion. both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. moreover, the results showed that the strains of e. faecalis, s. pyogenes and s.  mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and e. faecalis to the metronidazole. it was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than  in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. these microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.

TI  == familial oral microbial imbalance and dental caries occurrence in their children.
AB  == objective: develop a familial liability index for oral microbial status that reflects an imbalance of oral domains based on the presence of risk indicators in saliva, inter-proximal plaque, tongue, and throat. methods: fifty-six mother-child pairs from webster and nicholas counties, west virginia, usa, participated in this study. saliva samples were assayed for mutans streptococci (ms), interproximal plaque samples for the bana test (bt) species, tongue swabs for bt, and throat swabs for any of the sentinel organisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and yeasts). the corresponding thresholds for a (+) risk indicator were, respectively, >/=105 cfu of ms salivary levels, one or more bt-(+) plaques (>105 cfu/mg of plaque of at least one of bt-(+) species), weak-(+) bt for a tongue swab (>104-<105), and >104 cfu/swab for any of the sentinel markers. results: the mean age of mothers and children was 41.6 and 14.6 years. ninety-one % of both mothers and children had at least one (+) risk indicator. overall, 76% of mother child-pairs had at least one (+) concordant oral microbial risk indicator. accordingly, the relative risk (rr) of children having concordant results with their mothers was increased 1.36 (bt-plaque), 1.37 (bt-tongue), 0.94 (sentinel organisms) and 1.13 (ms) times. principal component analysis revealed distinct sets of oral microbial risk indicators in mothers and  children that correlated with dental caries prevalence rates in children. conclusions: mother-child pairs shared similarities of oral microbial risk indicators that allow for the development of a liability index that can elucidate caries in the children.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == the cryptic competence pathway in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked dna is acquired from the extracellular environment. induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in dna uptake, processing, and recombination. all streptococcal species contain the master regulator sigx and sigx-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. we recently demonstrated that competence development in streptococcus mutans requires the type ii comrs quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (l. mashburn-warren, d. a. morrison, and m. j. federle, mol. microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). the type ii comrs system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. here, we describe the activation of sigx by a small-peptide pheromone and an rgg regulator of the type ii comrs class. we confirm previous reports that sigx is functional and able to activate sigx-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that sigx stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease clpp. genomic analyses of available s. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. while this is the first report to show natural induction of sigx, s. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. using radiolabeled dna, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of dna uptake.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == evaluation of alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes considering that most of the previously proposed methods are expensive and cannot be easily implemented. two-hundred toothbrushes with standardized dimensions and bristles were included in the study. the toothbrushes were divided into 20 experimental groups (n = 10), according to microorganism considered and chemical agent used. the toothbrushes were contaminated in vitro by standardized suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus or candida albicans. the following disinfectants were tested: 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% white vinegar, a triclosan-containing dentifrice solution, and a perborate-based tablet solution.  the disinfection method was immersion in the disinfectant for 10 min. after the disinfection procedure, the number of remaining microbial cells was evaluated. the values of cfu/toothbrush of each group of microorganism after disinfection were compared by kruskal-wallis anova and dunn's test for multiple comparisons (5%). the chlorhexidine digluconate solution was the most effective disinfectant. the triclosan-based dentifrice solution promoted a significant reduction of all microorganisms' counts in relation to the control group. as to the disinfection with 50% vinegar, a significant reduction was observed for all the microorganisms, except for c. albicans. the sodium perborate solution was the less effective against the tested microorganisms. solutions based on triclosan-containing dentifrice may be considered effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and an easily applicable alternative for the disinfection of toothbrushes. the vinegar solution reduced the presence of s. aureus, s. mutans and s. pyogenes on toothbrushes.

AB  == objectives: to assess the antimicrobial effects of mentha spicata and eucalyptus  camaldulensis essential oils and chlorhexidine against streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pyogenes, with a particular focus on in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation. methods: the essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography (gc) and gc-mass spectrometry. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial and biofilm preventing activities of the oils were studied. results: fifteen and 21 compounds were identified in the essential oils of m. spicata and e. camaldulensis respectively. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of the m. spicata and e.  camaldulensis oils were found to be 4 and 2 mg ml(-1), and those of chlorhexidine (2%) were 8 and 1 mg ml(-1) for both s. mutans and s. pyogenes respectively. decimal reduction time of s. mutans by m. spicata and e. camaldulensis oils at their mbc levels was 2.8 min, while that of cholrhexidine was 12.8 min. d-value of s. pyogenes exposed to the mbc levels of m. spicata and e. camaldulensis oils  and of chlorhexidine were 4.3, 3.6 and 2.8 min respectively. antibacterial and in vivo biofilm preventive efficacies of all the concentrations of eucalyptus oil were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of m. spicata oil and chlorhexidine. in conclusion, essential oils are capable of affecting biofilm formation. conclusion: the essential oils from e. camaldulensis and m. spicata significantly retard biofilm formation that can contribute to the development of  novel anticaries treatments.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of streptococcus mutans provide insights into chromosomal shuffling and species-specific content.
AB  == background: streptococcus mutans is the major pathogen of dental caries, and it occasionally causes infective endocarditis. while the pathogenicity of this species is distinct from other human pathogenic streptococci, the species-specific evolution of the genus streptococcus and its genomic diversity are poorly understood. results: we have sequenced the complete genome of s. mutans serotype c strain nn2025, and compared it with the genome of ua159. the nn2025 genome is composed of 2,013,587 bp, and the two strains show highly conserved core-genome. however, comparison of the two s. mutans strains showed a  large genomic inversion across the replication axis producing an x-shaped symmetrical dna dot plot. this phenomenon was also observed between other streptococcal species, indicating that streptococcal genetic rearrangements across the replication axis play an important role in streptococcus genetic shuffling. we further confirmed the genomic diversity among 95 clinical isolates  using long-pcr analysis. genomic diversity in s. mutans appears to occur frequently between insertion sequence (is) elements and transposons, and these diversity regions consist of restriction/modification systems, antimicrobial peptide synthesis systems, and transporters. s. mutans may preferentially reject  the phage infection by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  (crisprs). in particular, the crispr-2 region, which is highly divergent between  strains, in nn2025 has long repeated spacer sequences corresponding to the streptococcal phage genome. conclusion: these observations suggest that s. mutans strains evolve through chromosomal shuffling and that phage infection is not needed for gene acquisition. in contrast, s. pyogenes tolerates phage infection for acquisition of virulence determinants for niche adaptation.

TI  == shuttle expression plasmids for genetic studies in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a set of shuttle plasmids containing four different constitutive promoters was generated to facilitate overexpression of foreign and native genes in streptococci, such as streptococcus mutans. the four promoters that were chosen were: p(ami), p(spac), p(23) and p(veg). these promoters are active in many gram-positive bacteria, and allow various levels of gene expression depending on  the host bacterium. shuttle plasmids were constructed based on two types of broad-host-range replication origins: a rolling-circle replicon (psh71) and a theta replicon (pambeta1). shuttle plasmids derived from the pambeta1 replicon were generated to avoid the structural and segregational stability problems associated with rolling-circle replication, since these problems may be encountered during large gene cloning. in a complementation assay, we used one such plasmid to express a gene in trans to show the utility of these plasmids. in addition, a series of plasmids was generated for the expression of recombinant proteins with an n-terminal 6xhis tag or a c-terminal strep-tag fusion, and, using a gene derived from s. mutans, we showed a high level of recombinant protein expression in s. mutans and streptococcus pyogenes. since these plasmids  contain broad-host-range replication origins, and because the selected promoters  are functional in many bacteria, they can be used for gene expression studies, such as complementation and recombinant protein expression.

AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

AB  == a sequence of 1647 base pairs in length of streptococcus mutans dna that encodes  for a 63-kda protein with significant amino acid similarity with fibronectin-binding proteins of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus gordonii was cloned. the putative recombinant fibronectin-binding protein of s. mutans was purified using affinity chromatography and the cloned protein was used to prepare polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein. in immunoblot assays, antibodies against the s. pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein, fbp54, were cross-reactive with the s. mutans protein that was designated smfnb. additionally, antibodies to the s. mutans smfnb protein reacted with the s. pyogenes fbp54 protein. the s. mutans smfnb protein was found to bind to immobilized fibronectin in a concentration dependant manner. a mutant strain of s. mutans m51 that was constructed by allelic exchange did not express the smfnb  protein. this mutant strain, s. mutans deltasmfnb, was determined in an elisa to  bind to immobilized fibronectin 30% less when compared to the parental strain s.  mutans m51. the results are consistent with the conclusion that the 63-kda smfnb  protein of s. mutans is a fibronectin-binding protein that may contribute to the  interaction of s. mutans with damaged heart tissue during pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. also, the study suggests that multiple molecules may mediate the interaction of s. mutans with fibronectin.

AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == phytotherapeutic inhibition of supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == antimicrobial activities and biofilm-formation preventive properties of mentha piperita and cuminum cyminum essential oils and chlorhexidine were assessed against streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pyogenes. gas chromatography (gc)  and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis led to the identification of 26 and 32 compounds in the essential oils of m. piperita and c. cyminum, respectively. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of the oils and  chlorhexidine and microbial decimal reduction time (d value) were determined. antibacterial and in vivo biofilm preventive efficacies of all the concentrations of m. piperita oil were significantly (p<0.001) higher. the biofilm inhibitory properties in planktonic cultures were in m. piperita > chlorhexidine > c. cyminum order. in vivo experiments conducted on male and female volunteers who brushed with essential oil blended toothpastes indicated that lower concentrations of the oils, in particular the m. piperita oil, were significantly higher (p<0.001) and effective during the course of the study as compared to chlorhexidine. in conclusion, there may be a potential role for essential oils in the development of novel anticaries treatments.

TI  == deficiency of the rgg regulator promotes h2o2 resistance, ahpcf-mediated h2o2 decomposition, and virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]), a catalase-negative gram-positive bacterium, is aerotolerant and survives h2o2 exposures that kill many catalase-positive bacteria. the molecular basis of the h2o2 resistance is poorly known. here, we demonstrate that serotype m49 gas lacking the rgg regulator is more resistant to h2o2 and also decomposes more h2o2 than the parental strain. subgenomic transcriptional profiling and genome-integrated green fluorescent protein reporters showed that a bicistronic operon, a homolog of the  streptococcus mutans ahpcf operon, is transcriptionally up-regulated in the absence of rgg. phenotypic assays with ahpcf operon knockouts demonstrated that the gene products decompose h2o2 and protect gas against peroxide stress. in a murine intraperitoneal-infection model, rgg deficiency increased the virulence of gas, although in an ahpcf-independent manner. rgg-mediated repression of h2o2 resistance is divergent from the previously characterized peroxide resistance repressor perr. moreover, rgg-mediated repression of h2o2 resistance is inducible by cellular stresses of diverse natures--ethanol, organic hydroperoxide, and h2o2. rgg is thus identified as a novel sensoregulator of streptococcal h2o2 resistance with potential implications for the virulence of the catalase-negative gas.

TI  == antibacterial activity of red and white wine against oral streptococci.
AB  == wine contains a number of biologically active compounds with beneficial effects on human health. the antibacterial action of commercial red and white wines against oral streptococci responsible for caries development and against s. pyogenes responsible for pharyngitis was studied. its postcontact effect against  s. mutans was also studied. both wines displayed activity. the compounds responsible for such activities were succinic, malic, lactic, tartaric, citric, and acetic acid. the synthetic mixtures of the organic acids tested at the concentrations found in wine had greater antibacterial activity than the beverages, indicating that in wine they are inhibited by other components. wine polyphenols displayed no activity against oral streptococci or s. pyogenes. findings show that wine is active against oral streptococci and s. pyogenes and suggest that it enhances oral health.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of the streptococcus mutans type aii lantibiotic mutacin k8.
AB  == streptococcus mutans strain k8 was shown to produce a newly identified type aii lantibiotic, mutacin k8. the mutacin k8-encoding muk locus consists of 13 orfs, three of which (muka1, a2 and a3) have close homology to scna, the structural gene encoding the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22, and another (muka') resembles scna', an orf in the sa-ff22 locus that has no currently assigned function. inactivation of the muk locus indicated that mutacin k8 is responsible  for most of the inhibitory activity produced by strain k8 in deferred antagonism  tests on columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5 % human blood and 0.1 % caco(3). by contrast, on tryptic soy agar plus 2 % yeast extract and 0.5 % caco(3) most of the inhibitory activity of strain k8 appeared to be attributable  either to mutacin iv or to some other inhibitory peptide(s) exported by the mutacin iv transporter nlmt. an inhibitory peptide purified from a derivative of  strain k8 in which nlmt had been inactivated had a mass of 2734 da and an n-terminal sequence identical to the predicted propeptide translation products of muka1 and muka3. the muk locus may be widely distributed in s. mutans, since 9 (35 %) of 26 strains tested contained at least part of the locus. in the genome sequence of strain ua159 the muk locus is incomplete, the sole residual components being the orfs encoding the putative two-component regulatory system mukr (smu.1815) and mukk (smu.1814), followed by two transposases (smu.1813 and smu.1812) and then the orfs mukf (smu.1811), muke (smu.1810) and mukg (smu.1809), thought to encode putative immunity peptides. strains such as ua159 having incomplete loci did not produce detectable levels of mutacin k8.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies against streptococcus mutans antigens.
AB  == several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. in this work, the reactivity of five anti-streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (moab) (24a, 56g, c8, e8 and f6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of  these moab. the hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the igg2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. moab were tested by elisa. the hybrid 24a reacted with s. mutans cct 1910, s. salivarius cct 0365 and s. pyogenes t23. no reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). the hybrid 56g reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between s. mutans and s. pyogenes t23 (p < 0.001). this hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). c8, e8 and f6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. the data of this study showed that the 24a and 56g anti-s. mutans moab presented reactivity with s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. the tested moab presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == regulation of the glucosyltransferase (gtfbc) operon by covr in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is an important etiological agent of dental caries in humans. the extracellular polysaccharides synthesized by cell-associated glucosyltransferases (encoded by gtfbc) from sucrose have been recognized as one  of the important virulence factors that promote cell aggregation and adherence to teeth, leading to dental plaque formation. in this study, we have characterized the effect of covr, a global response regulator, on glucosyltransferase expression. inactivation of covr in strain ua159 resulted in a marked increase in the gtfb and gtfc proteins, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis. with the use of a transcriptional reporter system of a single chromosomal copy of the pgtfb-gusa and pgtfc-gusa fusions, we confirmed the transcriptional regulation of these promoters by covr. by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified covr protein, we showed that  covr regulates these promoters directly. dnase i footprinting analyses suggest that covr binds to large regions on these promoters near the transcription start  sites. taken together, our results indicate that covr negatively regulates the expression of the gtfb and gtfc genes by directly binding to the promoter region.

TI  == fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  == salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. in this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis), and oral actinomyces. fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. group i streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group ii streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group  iii streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. each species of streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two  of these gp340 interaction groupings. the gp340 interaction modes i to iii and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. many  gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (i to iii) for s. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. adherence of s. gordonii dl1 (challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon  expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin hsa. however, aggregation of cells  by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of hsa and involved sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides. conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of s. mutans ng8 involved antigen i/ii polypeptide. deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in s. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. these results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. this phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.

TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.

TI  == a two-component covrs regulatory system regulates expression of fructosyltransferase and a novel extracellular carbohydrate in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the expression of fructosyltransferase (ftf), the enzyme that synthesizes fructan from sucrose, is regulated in the cariogenic bacterium streptococcus mutans. however, the exact mechanism of ftf regulation is unknown. in this study, the role of a two-component regulatory system (covrs) in ftf expression was investigated. a covr-defective mutant of s. mutans ng8 was constructed by homologous recombination. by use of immunoblotting, the mutant was shown to overexpress ftf in the absence of sucrose, while the wild type and a covrs-complemented mutant showed sucrose-inducible ftf expression. reverse transcription-pcr showed that the ftf transcript levels were increased in the covr mutant, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. the covr mutant  was also found to overproduce extracellular carbohydrate, and this phenotype was  reversed by covrs complementation. paper chromatographic studies and chemical tests showed that the extracellular carbohydrate contained glucose and glucuronic acid but not fructose. these results suggest that the extracellular carbohydrate  was not fructan. the production of a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing extracellular carbohydrate has not been reported for s. mutans and may be considered novel. in conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of ftf  and a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing carbohydrate was negatively regulated by the covrs two-component regulatory system in s. mutans.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == genetic characterization of a streptococcus mutans lrai family operon and role in virulence.
AB  == proteins belonging to the lrai (for "lipoprotein receptor antigen") family function as adhesins in several streptococci, as a virulence factor for endocarditis in at least one of these species, and potentially as metal transporters in many bacteria. we have identified and characterized the chromosomal locus containing the lrai family gene (designated sloc) from streptococcus mutans, an agent of dental caries and endocarditis in humans. northern blot analysis indicated that sloc is cotranscribed with three other genes. as with other lrai operons, the sloa and slob genes apparently encode components of an atp-binding cassette transport system. the product of the fourth gene, slor, has homology to the metal-dependent regulator from corynebacterium diphtheriae, dtxr. a potential binding site for slor was identified upstream from the sloabcr operon and was conserved upstream from lrai operons in several other  streptococci. potential slor homologs were identified in the unfinished genomic sequences from two of these, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. mutagenesis of sloc in s. mutans resulted in apparent loss of expression of the entire operon as assessed by northern blot analysis. the sloc mutant was indistinguishable from its wild-type parent in a gnotobiotic rat model of caries but was significantly less virulent in a rat model of endocarditis. virulence for endocarditis was restored by correction of the sloc mutation but not by provision of the sloc gene in trans, suggesting that virulence requires the expression of other genes in the sloc operon.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

AB  == the interaction of viridans streptococci with components of the extracellular matrix (ecm) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. we have identified a surface protein of streptococcus mutans which  binds the ecm constituent fibronectin (fn). initially, we found that s. mutans could adsorb soluble fn in plasma, but with lower efficiency than streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, s. mutans could bind immobilized fn in a dose-dependent manner when tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. crude extracts of  cell wall-associated proteins or extracellular proteins from s. mutans mt8148 specifically bound fn through a protein with the molecular mass of ca. 130 kda, as detected by far-western immunoblotting. the candidate fn binding protein (fbp-130) was purified to near homogeneity by using fn coupled sepharose 4b affinity column chromatography. a rabbit polyclonal antibody against fbp-130 reacted specifically with a protein of molecular mass of ca. 130 kda in both cell wall and extracellular fractions, and the abundance of fbp was higher in the former than in the latter fractions. the purified fbp bound specifically to immobilized fn, whereas the binding of soluble fn to coated fbp could only be detected in the presence of high concentrations of fn. the purified fbp, as well  as anti-fbp immunoglobulin g, inhibited the adherence of s. mutans to immobilized fn and endothelial cells (ecv304) in a dose-dependent manner. these results demonstrated that fbp-130 mediated the adherence of s. mutans specifically to fn  and endothelial cells in vitro. the characteristics of s. mutans and fbp-130 in binding fn confirmed that viridans streptococci adopt different strategies in their interaction with ecm.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == accumulation of ppgpp in streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus rattus following amino acid starvation.
AB  == we have re-examined the stringent response of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus pyogenes, two organisms that had originally been reported not to accumulate ppgpp following amino acid deprivation. we conclude that ppgpp does accumulate when s. rattus and s. pyogenes are deprived of isoleucine by mupirocin addition. the kinetics of ppgpp accumulation was faster in s. pyogenes compared with s. rattus. cell fractionation and analysis of in vitro ppgpp synthesis showed that in s. pyogenes most activity was associated with the s-100 ribosomal  pellet, whereas in s. rattus the s-100 soluble fraction contained greater activity. the addition of 20% methanol or salt-washed ribosomes to the assay mixture did not stimulate the in vitro (p)ppgpp synthesis activity of fractions isolated from s. rattus or s. pyogenes. western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts with anti-rela antibody demonstrated that neither organism cross-reacted under conditions that detected rela in e. coli cf1648. however, cross-reaction with anti-relseq antibody was observed in s. pyogenes but not s. rattus, suggesting that ppgpp synthesis is carried out by a putative spot protein in s. pyogenes and by a functionally unknown protein in s. rattus.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == streptococcal histone-like protein: primary structure of hlpa and protein binding to lipoteichoic acid and epithelial cells.
AB  == in addition to its role in the nucleoid, the histone-like protein (hlpa) of streptococcus pyogenes is believed to act as a fortuitous virulence factor in delayed sequelae by binding to heparan sulfate-proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of target organs and acting as a nidus for in situ immune complex formation. to further characterize this protein, the hlpa genes were cloned from  s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, s. mutans, and s. sobrinus, using pcr amplification, and sequenced. the encoded hlpa protein of s. pyogenes has 91 amino acids, a predicted molecular mass of 9,647 da, an isoelectric point of 9.81, and 90% to 95% sequence identity with hlpa of several oral streptococci. the consensus sequence of streptococcal hlpa has 69% identity with the consensus sequence of the histone-like hb protein of bacillus species. oral viridans group streptococci, growing in chemically defined medium at ph 6.8, released hlpa into  the milieu during stationary phase as a result of limited cell lysis. hlpa was not released by these bacteria when grown at ph 6.0 or below. s. pyogenes did not release hlpa during growth in vitro; however, analyses of sera from 155 pharyngitis patients revealed a strong correlation (p < 0.0017) between the production of antibodies to hlpa and antibodies to streptolysin o, indicating that the histone-like protein is released by group a streptococci growing in vivo. extracellular hlpa formed soluble complexes with lipoteichoic acid in vitro and bound readily to heparan sulfate on hep-2 cell surfaces. these results support a potential role for hlpa in the pathogenesis of streptococcus-induced tissue inflammation.

TI  == mode of action of a lysostaphin-like bacteriolytic agent produced by streptococcus zooepidemicus 4881.

TI  == possible role for a polysaccharide antigen shared between streptococcus pyogenes  and s. mutans in the pathogenesis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been shown to share a polysaccharide (ps) antigen with s. pyogenes strains isolated from patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (psgn), using a monoclonal antibody f-77 reactive with the ps. to investigate the pathogenetic role of the shared ps in psng, experimental nephritis was induced in animals. rats were immunized thrice with heat-killed cells of s. mutans or s. pyogenes, followed by an intravenous injection of live cells of s. pyogenes. histologic examination showed that both animal groups had comparable degrees of diffuse proliferative nephritis characterized by immune deposits. the shared ps antigen was detected in glomeruli of all nephritic rats by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody f-77. furthermore, all nephritic  rats had an elevated antibody titer to the shared ps antigen. these results suggest that prior sensitization (infections such as dental caries) to s. mutans  modulates immune responses to subsequent s. pyogenes infections and induces immune-complex disease (psgn) through the shared ps antigen.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

AB  == the effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on growth, cell surface hydrophobicity and the susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnl) was examined in four streptococcus species. exposure to either 10 x mic azithromycin or erythromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of between 2.4 and 4.3 h. erythromycin caused a longer pae for s. sanguis than azithromycin under the same conditions. the cell surface charge (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) of the streptococci was altered significantly during pae; loss of hydrophobicity was induced by both macrolides,  and this effect was variable amongst the species. the decrease in hydrophobicity  was not related to inhibition of growth. the effect of each drug during pae on the interaction of opsonised suspensions of the streptococci with human pmnl revealed that erythromycin, and to a lesser extent azithromycin, increased susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human pmnl; this effect was abolished following pae. the present study clearly showed that pae should not only be considered as delayed bacterial growth, but also as modulation of bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis which may influence the outcome of the host-parasite relationship.

TI  == identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == surface proteins of streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. the  reason for this is not clear. the present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. the results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of s. mutans ng8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a ph-dependent manner with optimal release at ph 5 to 6. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. two proteins, adhesin p1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. the release of adhesin p1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, cu2+,zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. the inhibition by heat and cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. edta, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and n-p-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of p1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. adhesin p1 from cu(2+)-inactivated s. mutans ng8 protoplasts could be released by mixing  with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a p1-negative mutant of ng8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. this p1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of s.  mutans and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes. the biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. however, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == immunological cross-reactivity between streptococcus mutans and human heart tissue examined by cross-immunization experiments.
AB  == hyperimmunization of rabbits with streptococcus mutans or other related cariogenic streptococci sometimes induces serum antibodies that react with human  heart muscle. to determine whether antigen i/ii (agi/ii), a major surface protein antigen present in most human isolates of these organisms, was responsible for inducing cross-reactive antibodies, we tested it for antigenic similarity to heart components, exploiting the ability of immune systems to mount anamnestic responses to antigens previously encountered. mice immunized with a strain of streptococcus pyogenes type m6, known to be heart cross-reactive, or with intact  s. mutans cells developed antibodies that could be detected on a human heart sarcolemmal preparation. however, mice immunized with agi/ii and boosted with sarcolemma were unable to develop significant antisarcolemmal antibodies attributable to prior sensitization by agi/ii. similarly, agi/ii was unable to recall antisarcolemmal responses in mice previously immunized with sarcolemma. nevertheless, strong immunoglobulin g antibody responses to agi/ii were detected  at the single-cell level in spleens and as circulating antibodies in all mice immunized with agi/ii or agi/ii-bearing s. mutans. we conclude that the ability of s. mutans to induce heart-reactive antibodies is not due to antigenic similarity between agi/ii and components of human heart but may be caused by other cross-reactive antigens in the bacterial cells or by nonspecific stimulation of the immune system.

TI  == sequence and structural characteristics of the trypsin-resistant t6 surface protein of group a streptococci.
AB  == the gene for the trypsin-resistant surface t6 protein of streptococcus pyogenes d471 (m type 6) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene (tee6) and its flanking regions was determined and found to include only one major open reading frame coding for a protein of 537 amino acids (mr, 57,675). the n terminus of the deduced protein sequence exhibits features of a typical signal sequence, and the c-terminal segment was found to have a high degree of homology with the membrane anchor region of other  gram-positive surface proteins, such as streptococcal m protein, wapa protein from streptococcus mutans and staphylococcal protein a. a hexapeptide having the  consensus sequence lpstge and located immediately upstream of the c-terminal hydrophobic segment showed the highest degree of conservation at both the protein and dna levels, with nearly all reported surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. the amino acid composition of the t6 protein revealed 21% serine and threonine residues distributed nearly regularly throughout the molecule, and analysis of the secondary structure predicted a conformation composed of greater  than 70% beta-sheet potential interrupted by beta-turns or random coils. localization experiments in e. coli show very little t6 protein in the periplasmic space. when found here, however, this t6 protein had a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons, similar to that extracted from the streptococci by nonionic detergent. most of the t6 protein was found localized in the membrane fraction, where it was composed of a triple band of 60, 58, and 57 kilodaltons. the coexistence of streptococcal surface proteins which are either resistant (t protein) or sensitive (m protein) to proteolytic enzymes may offer a new dimension to the modulation of these antigens under specific biological conditions.

TI  == streptococcal-host interactions. structural and functional analysis of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  == colonization of oral tissues by streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (sag) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of sag. the ssp-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. the  n-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to m protein of streptococcus pyogenes. this region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. a second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. the third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the c terminus of the protein. secondary structure analysis of the ssp-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled e-f hand calcium binding domains. the ssp-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of ssp-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. the interactions of ssp-5 and of intact s. sanguis with sag were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand  involved in the binding reaction.

AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == surface-associated properties of streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == three strains of staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, cowan i and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes, str, mutans, str.  sanguis and str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with  a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the mic), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the mic of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of pmns. pretreatment of pmns with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of pmns.

TI  == biological and biochemical characterization of novel lipid-like antibacterial substances (mutalipocins) produced by streptoccus mutans strain 32k.
AB  == two novel antibacterial substances (designated mutalipocins) have been isolated from the culture supernatant of streptoccus mutans strain 32k (serotype c). the mutalipocins were purified by extraction of the culture supernatant with light petroleum (b.p. range 30-60 degrees c), followed by lobar column chromatography on lichroprep rp-8. hplc indicated that both mutalipocin preparations (ml-i and ml-ii) were homogeneous. the mr values of ml-i and ml-ii were less than 1000. both mutalipocins were unaffected by treatment over the ph range 3.0-10.0, or with phospholipase a or proteolytic enzymes, but were partially inactivated by treatment with lipase or phospholipase c. ml-ii was resistant to heat treatment.  tlc indicated that ml-i and ml-ii contained unsaturated, aldehyde and/or ketone,  and ester groups. the inhibition of s. mutans by ml-i and ml-ii was due to bactericidal, rather than bacteriostatic, activities. the antibacterial spectra of ml-i and ml-ii were narrower and more species-specific than those of bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == bacteriocin production by streptococcus salivarius strain p.
AB  == a bacteriocin, streptococcin sal-p, was isolated by freeze-thaw elution from cultures of streptococcus salivarius strain p grown on tryptic soy agar plus 1% neopeptone. the inhibitor could also be extracted with either 7 m urea of 1 m nacl from cells grown on this medium, but little activity was recovered from cells grown in liquid media of from the supernatants of these cultures. streptococcin sal-p was found to be a proteinaceous substance of molecular weight approximately 8000. it was remarkably stable at extremes of ph or temperature and appeared to adsorb nonspecifically to both sensitive and resistant bacterial cells and also to cellulose membranes. the range of its inhibitory activity was almost entirely against gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci, including strains of s. pyogenes and s. sanguis, but not s. mutans or group d streptococci. streptococcin sal-p was bactericidal for actively metabolizing susceptible strains.

TI  == bacterial adherence: adhesin-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surface.
AB  == recent studies have indicated that the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces is the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in animals and humans. an understanding of the mechanisms of attachment  and a definition of the adhesive molecules on the surfaces of bacteria (adhesins) as well as those on host cell membranes (receptors) have suggested new approaches to the prevention of serious bacterial infections: (1) application of purified adhesion or receptor materials or their analogues as competitive inhibitors of bacterial adherence; (2) administration of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that suppress the formation and expression of bacterial adhesins; and (3) development of vaccines against bacterial surface components involved in adhesion to mucosal surfaces. progress has already been made in the development of antiadhesive vaccines directed against the fimbrial adhesins of several human  bacterial pathogens.

TI  == heterogeneity of group a type-specific antibodies.
AB  == extracting type 6 group a streptococcai with dilute nitrous acid releases an antigen that exhibits type-specific precipitating properties with anti-m6 serum but fails to neutralize the type-specific bactericidal reaction or to absorb the  bactericidal antibody from anti-m6 serum. these studies suggest that the precipitating and antiphagocytic properties of the m protein are attributable to  different antigenic determinants. the antigenic determinant responsible for bactericidal antibody is more sensitive to the deleterious effect of nitrous acid than is the moiety responsible for the precipitin reaction. use of the indirect fluorescent technique with anti-m sera absorbed with lyophilized nitrous acid extracts permits the possible differentiation of the two m-protein determinants in situ on the surface of streptococcal cells.

TI  == mutational loss of sensitivity to mutacin gs-5 in streptococcus pyogenes: characterization of a mutant deficient in receptor protein.
AB  == by means of a stepwise selection procedure, mutants capable of growing in the presence of relatively high multiplicities of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans gs-5 were obtained from a sensitivie strain of streptococcus pyogenes. mutacin-neutralizing activity of cell extracts containing receptor protein was examined in one variant that adsorbed 1/6 the amount of bacteriocin adsorbed by the parent strain under conditions equivalent to "saturation." partially purified receptor protein from both parent and mutant cells neutralized an equivalent amount of bacteriocin on a weight-to-weight basis, indicating that in vitro there was no significant difference in affinity for the mutacin between the respective  receptor fractions. cell extracts from the mutant, solubilized by treatment with  trichloroacetic acid, neither neutralized mutacin activity nor interfered with receptor protein-mediated mutacin neutralization in vitro. the mutant phenotype may thus represent a cell surface density of receptor protein which results in the adsorption of sublethal amounts of mutacin. the mutant retained its sensitivity to other mutacins, e.g., those produced by strains lm-7 and bht of s. mutans, and did not differ from wild-type cells with respect to either detergent  sensitivity (sodium lauryl sulfate and triton x-100) or to inhibition by penicillin, rifampin, bacitracin, erythromycin, and tetracycline.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. this enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. it contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterium lepraemurium. when used as an antigen in rabbits, the s. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. this antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of s. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other  streptococci, such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. lactis. the inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of s. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of o(2) (-). a variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. the iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of h(2)o(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. there was  no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their gram-stain reaction.

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

AB  == human leukocyte extracts, egg white lysozyme, cationic proteins, polymyxin, colimycin, and phenol are capable of releasing lipoteichoic acids (lta) from group a streptococci and strep. mutans. while the extraction of lta by phenol is  optimal at ph 4.7, the release of lta from streptococci by the other agents is optimal at ph 7.4. lta released by all agents was found to have the same sensitizing abilities, as determined by passive hemagglutination, and to have a similar chemical composition, as shown by thin-layer chromatography and radioactive scanning. the lta-releasing capacity of all the agents is strongly inhibited by normal human serum. the possible role played by lta released by leukocyte factors in the pathogenesis of tissue damage during bacterial infections is discussed.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

TI  == purification and immunochemical characterization of type e polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the type-specific antigen of streptococcus mutans strain mt703, serotype e, has been chromatographically purified and characterized. two chromatographic fractions were obtained from saline extracts which reacted with both anti-mt703 whole-cell serum and lancefield group e serum. the major fraction (ei) was identified as a polysaccharide composed of 37% glucose, 56% rhamnose, 5% protein, and 0.3% phosphorus, whereas the minor fraction (eii) contained 66% protein in addition to 10% glucose and 17% rhamnose. the immunological specificity of these  antigens was found to be the same by immunodiffusion in agar gel. another fraction with a negative charge (eiii) reacted with polyglycerophosphate antisera from streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pyogenes. for comparison, the mt703 antigen in a hot trichloroacetic acid extract (ea) and the group e antigen from a saline extract of cells of strain k129 (ei) were similarly purified by anionic ion-exchange chromatography. although the ratio of glucose and rhamnose in ea was 1:0.9 and in ei and eii approximately 1:1.5, reactions of identity were obtained  in gel diffusion against specific anti-e serum. this difference in ratio is probably a result of the extraction procedures. both the type e and group e antisera were reactive with both ei and ei antigens. the adsorption of group e antiserum with mt703 cells removed all e antibody, whereas type e-specific antibody remained after adsorption with k129 cells. these results suggest that ei antigen possesses both e and e specificities, whereas ei possesses e only. these  findings were supported by the quantitative precipitin test and immunodiffusion and/or immunoelectrophoretic patterns in agar gel. methyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside  markedly inhibited the precipitin reaction in both type e and group e sera. however, a significantly stronger inhibition by cellobiose of type e serum than of group e serum indicates that a beta-linked glucose-glucose dimer is the predominant antigenic determinant of the e specificity. the presence of both e and e specificities on a single polysaccharide molecule was demonstrated by the use of purified e antigen released from a specific e-anti-e complex. this antigen reacted with a group e-specific serum as well as a type e-specific serum. an examination of five s. mutans type e strains showed the presence of group e specificity also, whereas the i, ii, and iv serotypes of group e streptococci only possessed the group e specificity.

AB  == an extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. the  lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts  of a standardized suspension of group a streptococci in broth. no lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen  in electron micrographs. the material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups a, c, d, g, h, l, and o streptococci. it was inactive against strains of s. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, bacillus  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. it was sensitive to trysin and pronase and resistant to catalase. it possessed a  molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. the properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. group a streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as  did the sensitive cells. the bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 c.

AB  == the lysis of 14c-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. while staphylococcus albus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. group a streptococcus, listeria monocytogenes, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. the  lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due  to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. the lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by kcn or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dna, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-l-glutamic acid. other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

TI  == bacteriocin production and susceptibility among strains of streptococcus mutans grown in the presence of sucrose.
AB  == whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five s. mutans and one s. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins. in contrast, the susceptibility of three s. faecalis and one s. pyogenes strains  was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose. since  the s. mutans and s. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the s. faecalis and s. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action. this supports previous suggestions that such bacteriocins are not active in vivo and therefore play no role in regulating the microbial ecology in dental plaque.
