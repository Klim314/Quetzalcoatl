TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 5-halogenomethylsulfonyl- benzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives.
AB  == a series of 5-halogenomethylsulfonylbenzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives was synthesized as potential antibacterial agents. a new method of synthesis of benzimidazoles was developed. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were tested against a series of reference and clinical strains. the reference strains include gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. subtilis, b. cereus, e. hirae, m. luteus) and gram-negative rods (e. coli, p. vulgaris, p.  aeruginosa, b. bronchiseptica). the clinical strains include six methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and two methicillin-sensitive (mssa) s. aureus strains, one methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, three e. faecalis and two e. faecium strains. compound with trifluoromethyl- substituent at c-2 position (4) displayed significant antibacterial activities comparable with nitrofurantoin against four strains, and higher against micrococcus luteus. mic values for clinical staphylococci strains (mrsa) were 12.5-25 mug/ml; for enterococcus strains these values were 50-100 mug/ml. mic values for reference and clinical strains of staphylococcus and enterococcus group were similar, respectively.

TI  == technological properties and probiotic potential of enterococcus faecium strains  isolated from cow milk.
AB  == aim: to identify enterococci from the fermentation of milk for the production of  nono, an african fermented dairy product, to determine the technological properties for suitability as starter cultures and safety as probiotics. methods  and results: enterococcus faecium cm4 and enterococcus faecium 2cm1 were isolated from raw cow's milk. the strains were phenotypically and genotypically identified. technological properties, safety investigations, in vitro adherence properties and antimicrobial characteristics were carried out. strong acidification and tolerance to bile salts were recorded. the strains were bile salts hydrolytic positive and no haemolysis. there was no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics. the strains exhibited adherence to human collagen type iv, human fibrinogen and fibronectin. the bacteriocins were active  against bacillus cereus dsm 2301, bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes. bacteriocins were stable at ph 4-9 and on treatment with lipase, catalase, alpha-amylase and pepsin, while their activity was lost on treatment with other proteases. the bacteriocins produced were heat stable at 100 degrees c for 10 min. the bacteriocin produced by the strains was identified as enterocin a. conclusions: the e. faecium strains in this study exhibited probiotic activity, and the safety investigations indicate their suitability as good candidates for a starter culture fermentation process. significance and impact of the study: the use of bacteriocin-producing e. faecium strains as starter cultures in fermented foods is beneficial but, however, their safety investigations as probiotics must be greatly emphasized.

TI  == effect of calcium and magnesium on the antimicrobial action of enterocin lr/6 produced by enterococcus faecium lr/6.
AB  == enterococci are well-known producers of antimicrobial peptides (enterocins) that  possess potential as biopreservatives in food. in this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin lr/6 produced by enterococcus faecium lr/6 on three target gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, namely micrococcus luteus, enterococcus sp. strain lr/3 and escherichia coli k-12. whilst treatment  with enterocin lr/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, e. coli k-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. in this study it was shown that ca(2+) and mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin lr/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. k(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was  higher in m. luteus compared with the other two test strains. in agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to ca(2+) and mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of k(+) leakage by m. luteus and enterococcus sp.; in the case of e. coli k-12, no leakage of k(+) was recorded. these results suggest that enterocin  lr/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as  a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.

TI  == speciation of gram-positive bacteria in fresh and ambient-stored sub-tropical marine fish.
AB  == this study identified gram-positive bacteria in three sub-tropical marine fish species; pseudocaranx dentex (silver trevally), pagrus auratus (snapper) and mugil cephalus (sea mullet). it further elucidated the role played by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage on the composition of the gram-positive bacteria. a total of 266 isolates of gram-positive bacteria were identified by conventional biochemical methods, vitek, pcr using genus- and species-specific primers and/or 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolates were found to fall into 13 genera and 30 species. in fresh fish, staphylococcus epidermidis  and micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. after ambient storage, s. epidermidis, s. xylosus and bacillus megaterium were no longer present whereas s. warneri, b. sphaericus, brevibacillus borstelensis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus uberis increased in frequency. micrococcus luteus and s. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from p. dentex, while e. faecium and strep. uberis were the most frequent isolates from p. auratus and m. cephalus. with respect to different parts of the fish body, e. faecium, strep. uberis and b. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, e. faecium, strep. uberis from the gills and m. luteus from the gut. this study showed a diversity of gram-positive bacteria in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their abundance was affected by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage.

TI  == violacein-producing collimonas sp. from the sea surface microlayer of costal waters in trondelag, norway.
AB  == a new strain belonging to the genus collimonas was isolated from the sea surface  microlayer off the coast of trondelag, norway. the bacterium, designated collimonas ct, produced an antibacterial compound active against micrococcus luteus. subsequent studies using lc-ms identified this antibacterial compound as  violacein, known to be produced by several marine-derived bacteria. fragments of  the violacein biosynthesis genes vioa and viob were amplified by pcr from the collimonas ct genome and sequenced. phylogenetic analysis of these sequences demonstrated close relatedness of the collimonas ct violacein biosynthetic gene cluster to those in janthinobacterium lividum and duganella sp., suggesting relatively recent horizontal gene transfer. considering diverse biological activities of violacein, collimonas ct shall be further studied as a potential producer of this compound.

TI  == purification and characterization of enterocin lr/6, a bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium lr/6.
AB  == enterocin lr/6, a bacteriocin obtained from the culture filtrate of enterococcus  faecium strain lr/6, has been purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration, and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. it is active at high temperatures (boiling as well as autoclaving) and over a wide range of ph (2.0-8.0). also, it is sensitive to a number of proteolytic enzymes but is stable in the presence of surfactants and organic solvents. the protein could be stored  at least up to 1 year at low temperatures (4 degrees c and -20 degrees c) without any loss of activity. the n-terminal sequence of enterocin lr/6 showed no homology with known enterocins or other bacteriocins present in the database, suggesting it to be a novel enterocin. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed its mass to be approximately 6.1 kda. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against indicator  strain, micrococcus luteus.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  == counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, nacl and nitrate contents and ph and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the nw of spain. in general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. from mrs agar, spc agar + 7.5% nacl, vrbg agar, and kaa agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. a total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. among the isolates from mrs agar, lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus alimentarius and lactobacillus plantarum. of the 200 isolates obtained from spc agar + 7.5% nacl, only 56 strains belonged  to the staphylococcaceae or micrococcaceae families. among the staphylococcaceae, staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by staph. epidermidis; staph. equorum, staph. capitis and staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. among the micrococcaceae, micrococcus luteus predominated, followed  by micrococcus lylae, kocuria varians and kocuria kristinae. of the 150 isolates  obtained from vrbg agar, hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by serratia  liquefaciens and enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as salmonella. among the 190 isolates obtained from kaa agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as enterococcus faecium, one as enterococcus faecalis and 101 as enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. the aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(l-leucyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. this drug combination was especially effective against five vre strains: enterococcus faecium (k-99-38), e. faecalis (k-99-17), e. faecalis (k-99-258), e. faecium (k-01-312) and e. faecalis (k-01-511) with mic values of 0.25-1 mg/l. it was also effective against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans with mic values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. in addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against salmonella typhimurium ta98 and ta100 strains in a salmonella mutation assay. the number of mutant colonies of s. typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 induced by exposure to af-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(l-leu-l-pro) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in salmonella  strains.

TI  == mode of action of the antimicrobial peptide aureocin a53 from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we investigated the mode of action of aureocin a53 on living bacterial cells and  model membranes. aureocin a53 acted bactericidally against staphylococcus simulans 22, with >90% of the cells killed within a few minutes. cell death was followed by lysis, as indicated by a clearing of the cell suspension and gram staining. aureocin a53 rapidly dissipated the membrane potential and simultaneously stopped biosynthesis of dna, polysaccharides, and protein. aureocin a53 induced a rapid release of preaccumulated glutamate and rb(+). experiments on model membranes demonstrated that aureocin a53 provoked significant leakage of carboxyfluorescein (cf) exclusively from acidic liposomes  but only at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 8 mol%). thus, the bactericidal activity of aureocin a53 derives from membrane permeation via generalized membrane destruction rather than by formation of discrete pores within membranes. tryptophan emission fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated interaction of aureocin a53 with both acidic and neutral membranes, as indicated  by similar blue shifts. since there was no significant aureocin a53-induced cf leakage from neutral liposomes, its appears that the peptide does interact with neutral lipids without provoking membrane damage.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == [bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

TI  == [bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. i. contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  == in this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide b" and "high-grade steel") were tested. the surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus). after defined exposure times the  survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "guidelines of the german society of hygiene and microbiology". additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. in further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. after defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. the results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. humidity and only single contamination cause  a reduction of bacteria. reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than  reduction of gram-positive bacteria. enterococcus faecium shows the highest, pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
