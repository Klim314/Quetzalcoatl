TI  == [comparison of culture and real-time pcr methods in the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. this study was aimed to compare the detection rate  of s.pneumoniae and h.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. a total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. the samples were inoculated and incubated in bactec ped plus blood culture bottles and bactec 9120 system (bd diagnostic systems, md), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. for the molecular diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and hib capsule region, respectively were amplified by rt-pcr (lightcycler, roche diagnostics, germany). h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. in addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguinis, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans) were also isolated. on the other hand h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with rt-pcr, respectively. there was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae with rt-pcr compared to culture methods. when culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of rt-pcr in the detection of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. as a result, rt-pcr was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of h.influenzae and s.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute  otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == endophthalmitis after filtering surgery with mitomycin.
AB  == objective: to identify the incidence, causative organisms, and clinical outcomes  of eyes with bleb-associated endophthalmitis after glaucoma filtering procedures  with adjunctive mitomycin. methods: retrospective analysis of 773 consecutive eyes that underwent glaucoma filtering surgery at the bascom palmer eye institute, miami, fla. the course of 609 eyes from 485 patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were reviewed. results: mean follow-up was 16.0 +/- 11.5 months (range, 3-48 months). of the 609 eyes, 13 (2.1%) developed bleb-associated endophthalmitis an average of 18.5 +/- 13.2 months after surgery (range, 1-45 months). the incidence of bleb-associated endophthalmitis was significantly greater after inferior trabeculectomy (7.8% per patient-year) than after superior trabeculectomy (1.3% per patient-year) by kaplan-meier estimates (p = .02, log rank test). the cumulative incidence was 13% for inferior limbal blebs and 1.6% for superior limbal blebs. nine (69.2%) of the 13 eyes were culture positive. streptococcus sanguis and haemophilus influenzae (6/13 [46.2%]) were the most frequent causative organisms. the mean increase in intraocular pressure after endophthalmitis treatment was 1.2 mm hg, with a mean decrease in visual acuity of 1.42 logmar units. eight (61.5%) of the 13 eyes had a final acuity of 20/400 or better. conclusions: the incidence of bleb-associated endophthalmitis after guarded filtering surgery performed with adjunctive mitomycin is higher than the  reported rate in eyes undergoing filtering surgery without the use of antifibrotic agents (0.2%-1.5%). inferior limbal trabeculectomy carries the highest risk of infection. eyes with mitomycin blebs maintained excellent filtration capacity. however, after treatment of the infection, the visual outcomes were generally poor.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  == coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. a new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with  a continuous layer of bacteria. chips were covered with streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or streptococcus gordonii s7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4  and 24 h. there were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. however, the number of actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total actinomyces spp. was significantly  different on the two surfaces at 24 h. with the exception of actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus removed from the s7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. this study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation  had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.

TI  == [a clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (cs-976, papm/bp), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical  efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. the duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. when clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. it was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. it was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. papm/bp was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses  daily to 10 cases. for the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. the efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. the overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. as pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. they were gram-positive cocci including 2  strains each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus viridans  and a strain of streptococcus spp., and gram-negative rods including 9 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == analysis of the immunoglobulin a protease gene of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the amino acid sequence t-p-p-t-p-s-p-s is tandemly duplicated in the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1), the major antibody in secretions. the bacterial pathogen streptococcus sanguis, a precursor to dental caries and a cause of bacterial endocarditis, yields iga protease that cleaves only the pro-thr peptide bond in the left duplication, while the type 2 iga proteases of the genital pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae and the respiratory pathogen haemophilus influenzae cleave only the p-t bond in the right half. we have sequenced the entire s. sanguis iga gene cloned into escherichia coli. a segment  consisting of 20 amino acids tandemly repeated 10 times, of unknown function, occurs near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme encoded in e. coli. identification of a predicted zinc-binding region in the s. sanguis enzyme and the demonstration that mutations in this region result in production of a catalytically inactive protein support the idea that the enzyme is a metalloprotease. the n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae enzymes were earlier shown  to be serine-type proteases, while the bacteroides melaninogenicus iga protease was shown to be a cysteine-type enzyme. the streptococcal iga protease amino acid sequence has no significant homology with either of the two previously determined iga protease sequences, that of type 2 n. gonorrhoeae and type 1 h. influenzae. the differences in both structure and mechanism among these functionally analogous enzymes underscore their role in the infectious process and offer some  prospect of therapeutic intervention.

TI  == inhibition of iga1 proteinases from neisseria gonorrhoeae and hemophilus influenzae by peptide prolyl boronic acids.
AB  == the alpha-aminoboronic acid analog of proline has been synthesized and incorporated into a number of peptides as the cooh-terminal residue. these peptide prolyl boronic acids are potent inhibitors of both the type 1 and type 2  iga proteinases from neisseria gonorrhoeae and hemophilus influenzae, but not of  the functionally similar iga proteinase from streptococcus sanguis. the best inhibitors synthesized thus far have ki values in the nanomolar range (4.0 to 60  nm). these results indicate that the n. gonorrhoeae and the h. influenzae enzymes belong to the serine protease family of proteolytic enzymes while that from s. sanguis does not. as a group, the iga proteinases have been noted for their remarkable specificity; thus, the peptide prolyl boronic acids reported here are  the first small synthetic molecules to exhibit a relatively high affinity for the active site of an iga proteinase and are therefore the first to yield some insight into the active site structure and specificity requirements of these enzymes.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == quantitative screening of clinical isolates for immunoglobulin a protease production.
AB  == the production of immunoglobulin a (iga) protease is a potentially useful marker  in differentiating pathogenic from nonpathogenic species of clinical isolates; however, current quantitative assay methods are too tedious for routine application. a simple quantitative method was developed to screen clinical isolates for iga protease production. this method is based on the specificity of  reaction between iga and alpha chain-specific antiserum in an immunochemistry analyzer (beckman instruments, inc., brea, calif.). colonies of iga protease producers (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae) were picked from solid media, transferred to brain heart infusion containing iga1, and incubated at 37 degrees c for at least 2 h to provide a detectable decrease in iga concentration. the standard deviation for randomly picked colonies within a species was about +/- 15%. several iga protease-negative species caused no detectable reduction in the iga content of the system. the specificity of the iga measurement eliminates the requirements for extensive purification and radiolabeling of substrate and provides the basis for a well-defined iga protease activity unit (micrograms of iga1 cleaved per minute per milliliter of culture).

TI  == new method that uses binding of immunoglobulin a to group a streptococcal immunoglobulin a fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin a protease activity.
AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

TI  == iga1 proteases from haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus sanguis: comparative immunochemical studies.
AB  == iga1 proteases from h. influenzae, n. meningitidis, s. pneumoniae, and s. sanguis were compared with respect to site of cleavage in the iga1 molecule and edta sensitivity. proteases from s. sanguis and s. pneumoniae cleaved the pro (227)-thr (228) bond within the hinge region of the alpha 1 chain and were inhibited by edta. h. influenzae iga1 protease cleaved the pro (231)-ser (232) peptide bond. the activity of iga1 proteases from h. influenzae and n. meningitidis was unaffected by edta. purified and denatured alpha 1 chain was cleaved only in the hinge region. other component chains of secretory iga (secretory component, light and j chains) were not susceptible. in addition to iga1 protease, s. pneumoniae released exo- and endoglycosidases that removed a considerable portion of carbohydrate side chains of iga1; this activity was absent from crude iga1 protease preparations of the other three bacterial species. association in vitro of polymeric iga1 with sc did not inhibit the degradation of iga1 proteases. the considerable resistance of secretory iga to cleavage by iga1 proteases may be explained in part by the presence of iga1 protease-neutralizing antibodies in secretory iga.
