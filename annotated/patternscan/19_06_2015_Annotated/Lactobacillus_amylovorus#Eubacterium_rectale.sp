TI  == development of the gut microbiota in southern indian infants from birth to 6 months: a molecular analysis.
AB  == acquisition of the gastrointestinal microbiota at birth may have long-term health impacts. we longitudinally characterised major microbial communities in the faeces of a cohort of infants using molecular methods. faecal samples were prospectively obtained at several time points after birth from eighty-three infants. real-time pcr using sybr green and primers targeted at 16s rrna gene sequences were used to quantify bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella group, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, clostridium leptum group and staphylococcus. microbial community abundance was expressed relative to amplification of sequences conserved universally for domain bacteria. faecal copy number of 16s rrna genes increased non-significantly from a mean of 4.1 x 10(9)/g on day 1 to 1.1 x 10(10)/g on day 4. all microbial communities were detected from day 1 after birth. enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli predominated on day 1, while bifidobacteria and staphylocci increased on day 4. bacteroides-prevotella and c.  coccoides-e. rectale increased by day 180. c. leptum was detected in half of the  cohort at birth and in a slightly larger percentage by 6 months. caesarean section was associated with delayed colonisation by several bacterial communities. higher socio-economic status was associated with more abundant lactobacilli and bacteroides-prevotella at 90 and 180 d. supplemental feeding was associated with a reduction in enterobacteriaceae. microbial colonisation of the  gut was well established on the first day of birth, and relative abundance of microbial communities was influenced by mode of delivery, socio-economic status and supplemental feeding. these findings may have relevance to infant nutrition and growth.

TI  == the effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  == background: prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. the aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human  fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. methods and findings: carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (ncfm) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 (bl-04) under laboratory conditions. the most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (scfa).the following combinations were studied: ncfm with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (obgh) and bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. all carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of ncfm and bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2)  fold, respectively. also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio  of bacteroidetes/firmicutes (calculated using qpcr results for bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium perfringens cluster i, clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectale group and clostridial cluster xiv) as well as significantly increasing scfa levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. the decreases in the modified ratio of bacteroidetes/firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). conclusions: the results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of scfa of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.

TI  == gut microbiota of healthy elderly nsaid users is selectively modified with the administration of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and lactitol.
AB  == ageing changes gut microbiota composition and alters immune system function. probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics may improve the health status of elderly individuals by modifying the intestinal environment and the microbiota composition, and by stimulating the immune system. in this work, we studied the effects of synbiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota of healthy elderly volunteers. fifty-one elders were randomly assigned to consume either a synbiotic dietary supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual diet for a 2-week period. the synbiotic product consisted of the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and the prebiotic lactitol and was ingested twice a day, with a  total daily dose of 10 g lactitol and 2 x 10(10) cells of probiotic bacteria. before, during and after the intervention period fecal quantities of six phylogenetic bacterial groups were determined using quantitative pcr, and relative changes in total microbiota composition were assessed by percent guanine-plus-cytosine profiling. the microbiota profiles showed certain relative  changes within the microbial community, and indicated an increase of bifidobacteria levels during synbiotic supplementation. quantification by pcr confirmed the in changes in the microbiota composition; for example increases in  total levels of endogenous bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were recorded. throughout the 6-week study period there was a decrease unrelated to intervention in the blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale bacterial group levels and clostridium cluster xivab levels, but this decrease appeared to be halted during  the synbiotic intervention. in conclusion, putatively beneficial changes in microbiota were observed in the elderly subjects supplemented with the synbiotic  product.

TI  == low levels of faecal lactobacilli in women with iron-deficiency anaemia in south  india.
AB  == fe deficiency in women contributes significantly to maternal and child morbidity  in india. the intestinal bacterial flora may facilitate absorption of fe from the caecum and proximal colon. the present study investigated the possibility that intestinal microbiota of anaemic young women may differ from that of women with normal hb levels. the microbiota was quantified by real-time pcr in faeces of eight anaemic (hb </= 100 g/l) and twenty-six normohaemic (hb >/= 120 g/l) women  aged 18-25 years. sequences of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) specific to bifidobacterium genus, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium leptum group and eubacterium rectale were amplified and expressed (as relative difference) relative to the universally conserved bacterial 16s rdna sequences. dietary intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre and fe were ascertained by maintenance of  a diet diary for a week. faecal lactobacilli were significantly lower in anaemic  women (median 6.6 x 10(-8), relative difference compared with total bacteria) than in the reference group (2.9 x 10(-6); p = 0.001, unpaired t test with logarithmic transformation). there was no difference between the two groups with  respect to any of the other bacteria that were examined. intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre, fe and milk were similar in both the groups. fe deficiency in young women in south india was associated with low levels of lactobacilli in the faeces. the relationship between lactobacilli and fe deficiency needs to be explored further.

TI  == quantitative differences in intestinal faecalibacterium prausnitzii in obese indian children.
AB  == gut bacteria contribute to energy conservation in man through their ability to ferment unabsorbed carbohydrate. the present study examined the composition of predominant faecal microbiota in obese and non-obese children. the participants (n 28) aged 11-14 years provided fresh faecal samples and completed a dietary survey consisting of 24 h diet recall and a ffq of commonly used foods taken over the previous 3 months. faecal bacteria were quantitated by real-time pcr using primers targeted at 16s rdna. of the participants, fifteen (seven female) were obese, with median bmi-for-age at the 99th percentile (range 97 to>99) while thirteen participants (seven female) were normal weight, with median bmi-for age  being at the 50th percentile (range 1-85). consumption of energy, carbohydrates,  fat and protein was not significantly different between the obese and non-obese participants. there was no significant difference between the two groups in faecal levels of bacteroides-prevotella, bifidobacterium species, lactobacillus acidophilus group or eubacterium rectale. levels of faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly higher in obese children than in non-obese participants (p = 0.0253). we concluded that the finding of increased numbers of f. prausnitzii in  the faeces of obese children in south india adds to the growing information on alterations in faecal microbiota in obesity.

TI  == bacterial succession in the colon during childhood and adolescence: molecular studies in a southern indian village.
AB  == background: the colonic bacterial flora, largely anaerobic, is believed to establish and stabilize in the first 2 y of life. objective: this study was undertaken to determine whether the bacterial flora of the colon undergoes further changes (succession) during childhood and adolescence. design: this cross-sectional study examined fecal samples from 130 healthy children and adolescents in the age group 2-17 y and from 30 healthy adults (median age: 42 y) residing in a single village in southern india. dna was extracted and subjected to 16s rdna-targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the relative predominance of bifidobacterium genus, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, lactobacillus acidophilus group, eubacterium rectale, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. results: bifidobacterium species and bacteroides-prevotella group were dominant fecal bacteria overall. e. rectale and lactobacillus species were considerably less abundant. clear age-related differences emerged, with a steep decline in bifidobacterium species  in adults (p < 0.0001), a steep decline of lactobacillus species >5 y of age (p < 0.0001), an increase in bacteroides during late adolescence and in adults (p = 0.0040), an increase in e. rectale during childhood and adolescence followed by a steep decline in adults (p < 0.0001), and a late childhood peak of f. prausnitzii with decline in adolescents and adults (p < 0.0001). conclusions: changes in the  bacterial flora occur during childhood and adolescence characterized by reduction in lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species and an increase in bacteroides, e rectale, and f. prausnitzii peaked during late childhood in this population.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == ecophysiology of the developing total bacterial and lactobacillus communities in  the terminal small intestine of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning of the pig is generally regarded as a stressful event which could lead to clinical implications because of the changes in the intestinal ecosystem. the functional properties of microbiota inhabiting the pig's small intestine (si), including lactobacilli which are assumed to exert health-promoting properties, are yet poorly described. thus, we determined the ecophysiology of bacterial groups and within genus lactobacillus in the si of weaning piglets and the impact of dietary changes. the si contents of 20 piglets, 4 killed at weaning (only sow  milk and no creep feed) and 4 killed at 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post weaning (pw; cereal-based diet) were examined for bacterial cell count and bacterial metabolites by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). lactobacilli were the predominant group in the si except at 1 day pw because of a marked reduction in their number. on day 11 pw, bifidobacteria and e. coli were not detected, and enterobacteriaceae and members of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale cluster were only found occasionally. l. sobrius/l. amylovorus became dominant species whereas the abundance of l. salivarius and l. gasseri/johnsonii declined. concentration of lactic acid increased pw whereas ph, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia decreased. carbohydrate utilization of 76 lactobacillus spp. isolates was studied revealing a shift from lactose and galactose to starch, cellobiose, and xylose, suggesting that the bacteria colonizing the si of piglets adapt to the newly introduced nutrients during the early weaning period. identification of isolates based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence data and comparison with fermentation data furthermore suggested adaptation processes below the species level. the results of our study will help to understand intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and to develop nutritional regimes to prevent or counteract complications during the weaning transition.

TI  == inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
AB  == liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such  as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.
