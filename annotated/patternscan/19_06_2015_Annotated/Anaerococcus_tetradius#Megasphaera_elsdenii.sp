TI  == role of aromatic stacking interactions in the modulation of the two-electron reduction potentials of flavin and substrate/product in megasphaera elsdenii short-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase.
AB  == the effects of aromatic stacking interactions on the stabilization of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) and substrate/product have been investigated in short-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (scad) from megasphaera elsdenii. mutations were made at the aromatic residues phe160 and tyr366, which flank either face of the noncovalently bound flavin cofactor. the electrochemical properties of the mutants were then measured in the presence and absence of a butyryl-coa/crotonyl-coa mixture. results from these redox studies suggest that the phenylalanine and tyrosine both engage in favorable pi-sigma interactions with the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin to help stabilize formation of the anionic flavin hydroquinone. disruption of these interactions by replacing either residue with a leucine (f160l and y366l) causes the midpoint potential for the oxidized/hydroquinone couple (e(ox/hq)) to shift negative by 44-54 mv. the e(ox/hq) value was also found to decrease when aromatic residues containing electron-donating heteroatoms were introduced at the 160 position. potential shifts of -32 and -43 mv for the f160y and f160w mutants, respectively, are attributed to increased pi-pi repulsive interactions between the ring systems. this study also provides evidence for thermodynamic regulation of the substrate/product couple in the active site of scad. binding to the wild-type enzyme caused the midpoint potential for the butyryl-coa/crotonyl-coa couple (e(bcoa/ccoa)) to shift 14 mv negative, stabilizing the oxidized product. formation of product was found to be even more favorable in complexes with the f160y and f160w mutants, suggesting that the electrostatic environment around the flavin plays a role in substrate/product activation.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  == the maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus prevotii, 3% in ruminococcus albus, 4% in acidaminococcus fermentans, peptococcus niger and megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in peptococcus magnus. the biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt  tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid  identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.

TI  == susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from animals with ovine foot rot  to 28 antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the agar dilution method was used to determine the inhibitory activities of 28 antimicrobial agents against 35 strains of the genus peptostreptococcus, 4 strains of the species peptococcus niger, 20 strains of the species megasphaera elsdenii, 7 strains from the species acidaminococcus fermentans, 8 strains of the genus clostridium, 11 strains of the genus eubacterium, and 1 strain of the species propionibacterium acidipropionici, all of which were isolated from 125 clinical cases of ovine foot rot between january 1987 and december 1988. the three unreidopenicillins studied proved to be the most active antimicrobial agents, with a high percentage of strains being susceptible at a concentration of 64 micrograms/ml. penicillin g, ampicillin, and the three cephalosporins studied  also had good activity. fosfomycin showed a high degree of activity among the 116 anaerobic bacteria tested.

TI  == obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  == lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during october 1987 to november 1988. a total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. the anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: bacteroides (80%), peptostreptococcus (63.6%), megasphaera (40%), fusobacterium (29.2%), clostridium (22.5%), propionibacterium (12.5%), eubacterium (11.7%) and leptotrichia (10.8%). percentages for acidaminococcus, peptococcus, tissierella, wolinella and veillonella were below 10%. the following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), bacteroides buccae (51.7%), bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), megasphaera elsdenii (40%), bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and clostridium perfringens (10%). lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. the efficiency  and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of anaerobic bacteria from ovine foot rot in spain.
AB  == a microbiological study was made of 125 merino sheep showing clinical signs of foot rot. a total of 435 strictly anaerobic strains were isolated, belonging to the following genera: bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, tissierella, fusobacterium, megasphaera, eubacterium, acidaminococcus, clostridium, peptococcus and propionibacterium. of the 35 species obtained, the following were found in more than 10 per cent of animals sampled: bacteroides nodosus, b putredinis, b buccae, b ruminicola subspecies brevis, tissierella praeacuta, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and megasphaera elsdenii. six culture media were used for isolation. agar brucella and agar brucella enriched with g-n anaerobe supplement proved to be the most efficient for isolating anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == metabolism and some characteristics of ruminal strains of megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  == megasphaera elsdenii belongs to the group comprising the ruminal and intestinal lactate- and sugar-fermenting species. in the present study the fermentation characteristics, metabolism of glucose and lactate, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of four ruminal strains were investigated. particular attention was given to the mixed-substrate fermentation pattern and resultant fermentation acid profile. lactate was utilized more rapidly than glucose in media with both carbon sources. interaction of the two substrates changed the composition of fermentation end products toward more valerate and less propionate in cultures with glucose and lactate. contrary to the indications in bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, butyrate, not caproate, was the main end product of glucose metabolism. the strains examined were rather insensitive to many antimicrobial compounds, especially to ionophores and other antimicrobial feed additives.

TI  == enrichment and isolation of a ruminal bacterium with a very high specific activity of ammonia production.
AB  == when mixed ruminal bacteria were inoculated into semicontinuous cultures (25% transfer every other day) containing lactate, dulcitol, pectin, or xylose and trypticase (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source, the specific activity of ammonia production increased. the greatest enrichment was observed with lactate and xylose, and in these cases the specific rate of ammonia production was eightfold higher than that of the ruminal fluid control (approximately 35 nmol of ammonia per mg of protein per min). isolates with different morphologies were obtained from each of the enrichments, but in no case did the specific activity of any isolate exceed that of the mixed ruminal bacteria. if trypticase (15 g/liter) was used as the only energy and nitrogen source, there was an even greater increase in ammonia production, and two monensin-sensitive bacteria, a peptostreptococcus species and a clostridium species, were obtained. the peptostreptococcus species was unable to grow on any of 25 carbohydrate or carbohydrate derivatives tested; but the clostridium species was able to use glucose, maltose, fructose, cellobiose, trehalose, sorbitol, and salicin as energy sources. neither organism was able to grow in the absence of an amino acid source, but growth rates on trypticase were greater than 0.35/h. the specific activities of ammonia production were 346 and 427 nmol/mg of protein per min for  strains of peptostreptococcus and clostridium, respectively. megasphaera elsdenii and bacteroides ruminicola, previously isolated ruminal ammonia producers, had specific activities of only 11 and 19 nmol of ammonia per mg of protein per min,  respectively. the most probable number of clostridium species in ruminal fluid was less than 10(3)/ml, but the peptostreptococcus species was present at 10(8)/ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == nutritional characteristics of megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  == megasphaera elsdenii b159 (formerly peptostreptococcus elsdenii; rogosa 1971) is  able to grow in a chemically defined medium containing minerals, nh4+ as the sole nitrogen source, sulfate as the source of sulfur, acetate and glucose as the carbon and energy sources, and the vitamins biotin, pyridoxine, and calcium pantothenate. when lactate serves as the carbon source, with cysteine present as  the reducing agent, acetate is not required. valine and threonine appeared to be  required although direct inoculation of unwashed cells into media lacking these amino acids permitted growth in their absence after an extended incubation period. sulfur sources utilized included sulfate, sulfide, thiosulfate, cysteine, and glutathionine; methionine was utilized less readily. when glucose was autoclaved in the medium, the generation time of m. elsdenii was 170--200 min, but increased to more than 400 min when glucose was autoclaved separately and added to the cooled sterile medium. when fructose, which had been sterilized separately, was utilized as the carbon and energy source, the generation time was 200 min.

TI  == occurrence of megasphaera elsdenii in faecal samples of young pigs.
AB  == important numbers of megasphaera elsdenii, known as a normal inhabitant of the rumen of cattle and sheep were recently cultured from intestinal contents of man  and pigs. studying the occurrence of this organism in faecal contents of pigs, we paid attention to the use of a strict anaerobic isolating and counting technique. it was demonstrated that megasphaera elsdenii is a strict anaerobic organism. exposure to air during 15 minutes caused an important decrease of the colony count. comparison of the biochemical properties of some isolates with the data of other investigators is given. pigs isolates were nearly similar to rumen strains.
