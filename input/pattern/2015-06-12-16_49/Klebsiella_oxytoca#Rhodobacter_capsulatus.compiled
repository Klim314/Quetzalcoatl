TI  - Bacterial nitrate assimilation: gene distribution and regulation.
AB  - In the context of the global nitrogen cycle, the importance of inorganic nitrate  for the nutrition and growth of marine and freshwater autotrophic phytoplankton has long been recognized. In contrast, the utilization of nitrate by heterotrophic bacteria has historically received less attention because the primary role of these organisms has classically been considered to be the decomposition and mineralization of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen. In the pre-genome sequence era, it was known that some, but not all, heterotrophic bacteria were capable of growth on nitrate as a sole nitrogen source. However, examination of currently available prokaryotic genome sequences suggests that assimilatory nitrate reductase (Nas) systems are widespread phylogenetically in bacterial and archaeal heterotrophs. Until now, regulation of nitrate assimilation has been mainly studied in cyanobacteria. In contrast, in heterotrophic bacterial strains, the study of nitrate assimilation regulation has been limited to Rhodobacter capsulatus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Azotobacter vinelandii and Bacillus subtilis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the nas genes are subjected to dual control: ammonia repression by the general nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system and specific nitrate or nitrite induction. The Ntr system is widely distributed in bacteria, whereas the nitrate/nitrite-specific control is variable depending on the organism.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and transcriptional regulation of the draT and draG genes of  Azospirillum lipoferum FS.
AB  - From Azospirillum lipoferum (Al) FS, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of rice, we cloned and sequenced draT, encoding dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase, and draG, encoding dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase. The nucleotide sequences of draTG showed extensive similarity to the same genes from Azospirillum brasilense, Rhodospirillum rubrum and Rhodobacter capsulatus, and they are assumed to be co-transcribed as a single operon. When this draTG operon was introduced into Klebsiella oxytoca, this organism acquired the ability to respond to extracellular NH(+4) ions with reversible inhibition of nitrogenase activity, similar to that seen in Al FS. We constructed a plasmid containing a draT::lacZ gene fusion and found that beta-galactosidase activity was detected under microaerobic conditions, regardless of NH(+4) concentration, but not under aerobic conditions. This indicates that the transcription of draTG responds to the level of oxygen, but not to that of NH(+4) ions.
TI  - Anaerobic degradation of malonate via malonyl-CoA by Sporomusa malonica, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  - Anaerobic decarboxylation of malonate to acetate was studied with Sporomusa malonica, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Rhodobacter capsulatus. Whereas S. malonica could grow with malonate as sole substrate (Y = 2.0 g.mol-1), malonate decarboxylation by K. oxytoca was coupled with anaerobic growth only in the presence of a cosubstrate, e.g. sucrose or yeast extract (Ys = 1.1-1.8 g.mol malonate-1). R. capsulatus used malonate anaerobically only in the light, and growth yields with acetate and malonate were identical. Malonate decarboxylation in cell-free extracts of all three bacteria was stimulated by catalytic amounts of malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, or Coenzyme A plus ATP, indicating that actually malonyl-CoA was the substrate of decarboxylation. Less than 5% of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was found associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. Avidin (except for K. oxytoca) and hydroxylamine inhibited the enzyme completely, EDTA inhibited partially. In S. malonica and K. oxytoca, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was active only after growth with malonate; malonyl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase was found as well. These results indicate that malonate fermentation by these bacteria proceeds via malonyl-CoA mediated by a CoA transferase and that subsequent decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed, at least with S. malonica and R. capsulatus, by a biotin enzyme.
