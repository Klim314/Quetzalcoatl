TI  == antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. the antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory  activities against s. typhimurium. the antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria  to establish structure-activity relationships. hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. the l. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues  should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.

TI  == phytochemical, toxicological and antimicrobial evaluation of lawsonia inermis extracts against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: the emerging resistance of pathogen against the currently available antimicrobial agents demands the search of new antimicrobial agents. the use of medicinal plants as natural substitute is the paramount area of research to overwhelm the drug resistance of infectious agents. scientists have not made enough effort on the evaluation of safety of medicinal plant yet. methods: in the present study antimicrobial activity of lawsonia inermis is investigated against  clinical isolates of seven bacteria including four gram negative (escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella spp., shigella sonnei) and three gram positive (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis) using disc diffusion method. four types of lawsonia inermis extracts were prepared using methanol, chloroform, acetone and water as extraction solvents, while dmso (dimethyl sulfoxide) and water as dissolution solvents. the rate and extent of bacterial killing was estimated by time-kill kinetic assay at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate. the overall safety of lawsonia inermis extracts was assessed in mice. results: lawsonia inermis displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains used in the study. the minimum value of mic for different bacterial strains ranged from 2.31 mg/ml to 9.27 mg/ml. at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate, 3log10 decrease in cfu was recorded after 6 hours of drug exposure and no growth was observed in almost all  tested bacteria after 24 hours of exposure. no sign of toxidrome were observed during in vivo toxicity evaluation in mice at 300 mg/kg concentration. conclusion: in conclusion, the present study provides the scientific rational for medicinal use of lawsonia inermis. the use of lawsonia inermis extracts is of great significance as substitute antimicrobial agent in therapeutics.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of henna extracts.
AB  == lawsonia inermis (henna plant) has been used in herbal medicine for ages. however, the medical benefits of this plant have been discussed in only a few publications. in this study, the antibacterial effects of water, alcoholic and oily extracts of lawsonia inermis leaves against bacterial cultures isolated from various skin diseases were investigated and compared with tetracycline, ampicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics. cultures of staphylococcus  aureus staphylococcus epidermidis (co-agulase negative staphylococci or cons), ss-hemolytic streptococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa species were obtained from 74 (35 females, 39 males) patients with different skin infections who attended the dermatology outpatient clinic in basra general hospital. the bacterial isolates were treated with l. inermis extracts in vitro. alcoholic and oily extracts were more effective than the water extract which had no effects using standard method of nccl, 2000.alcoholic extracts had the highest antibacterial activity with a mic of 0.125-0.150 microg/ml against ss-hemolytic streptococci and against cons was 0.125-175 microg/ml .oily extracts had a mic of 0.25-0.30 microg/ml against staphylococcus epidermidis (cons). both alcoholic and oily extracts had the same mic (0.5 microg/ml) on staphylococcus aureus. however, alcoholic extracts were more effective on pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mic of 0.5-0.57 microg/ml than oily extract (mic of 0.20-0.28 microg/ml). however, there were no statically differences between the effects of oily and alcoholic henna extracts (p= 0.050).when comparing the extracts' mics with those of antibiotics,  alcoholic extracts showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the isolated bacteria in vitro but oily extracts had much similar mics to those of antibiotics and there are significant difference between effect of both extracts and antibiotics p>0.050.
