TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - Inhibition of Prevotella and Capnocytophaga immunoglobulin A1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  - Oral Prevotella and Capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases cleaving human IgA1 in the hinge region into intact Fab and Fc fragments. To investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven Prevotella and Capnocytophaga proteases. All or nearly all of the sera inhibited the IgA1 protease activity of Prevotella buccae, Prevotella oris, and Prevotella loescheii. A minor proportion of the sera inhibited Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, and Prevotella melaninogenica IgA1 proteases, while no sera inhibited Capnocytophaga ochracea IgA1 protease. All inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. No correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. The nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the IgA1 proteases of P. buccae, P. oris, and P. loescheii was further examined. In size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of IgA. Additional inhibition of the P. oris IgA1 protease was found in fractions containing both IgA and IgG. Purification of the IgG fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein G column resulted in recovery of inhibitory IgG antibodies against all three IgA1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the P. oris enzyme. These finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies.
TI  - Emended descriptions of Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella veroralis, and Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - During studies of human periodontal disease, a number of bacterial strains were encountered that, on the basis of results of standard biochemical tests, appeared to be Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, or Prevotella loescheii. However, use of the standard biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid analyses, and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins resulted in conflicting identifications of these strains. The results of tests for cellobiose fermentation, inulin fermentation, and pigment production were responsible for most of the discordant results. Cellular fatty acid analyses in which the Microbial Identification System was used did not differentiate these strains from validly described species, even though separate library entries were created for them. DNA reassociation determinations in which the S1 nuclease procedure was used showed that cellobiose fermentation and pigment production are variable among strains of P. melaninogenica and P. denticola and that fermentation of xylan is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating P. buccalis from Prevotella veroralis. In contrast to previous indications, most strains of P. veroralis do not ferment xylan. These species can be differentiated by DNA-DNA reassociation and by cellular fatty acid analysis, using the Microbial Identification System, but differentiation by currently described phenotypic characteristics is not reliable. Similarly, P. loescheii and the genetically distinct (but closely related) D1C-20 group cannot be distinguished reliably from each other or from P. veroralis, P. denticola, and P. melaninogenica on the basis of currently described phenotypic tests other than cellular fatty acid composition or, for some species, electrophoretic patterns of soluble whole-cell proteins.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - The use of whole-cell DNA probes for the identification of Bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  - Bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. These two groups are represented by the type strain of the species ATCC 25611T (B. intermedius type I) and by ATCC 33563 (B. intermedius type II). Members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by DNA-DNA homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. The purpose of this study was to prepare specific DNA probes for the two groups of Bacteroides intermedius and to test them against field isolates. Whole-cell DNA probes were prepared from B. intermedius types I and II and tested against 253 field strains of Bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as B. intermedius. Of these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the B. intermedius type I DNA probe, 28 (11%) with the type II, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the B. intermedius probes but did hybridize with either B. melaninogenicus, B. loescheii, or B. corporis whole-cell DNA probes. The 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five Bacteroides probes or with probes to B. asaccharolyticus, B. buccae, B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. gingivalis, B. oralis, or B. oris. These data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell DNA probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.
TI  - Use of the RapID-ANA System to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited Bacteroides.
AB  - The RapID-ANA System (Innovative Diagnostics Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited Bacteroides from humans. Bacteroides oris, Bacteroides veroralis, Bacteroides buccalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides loescheii, and Bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. Clear differentiation of these six species by the RapID-ANA System was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides disiens, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and Bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. No consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two DNA homology groups within Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides loescheii, or Bacteroides intermedius. Tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic Bacteroides species.
AB  - Various Bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. The data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using Gower's similarity coefficients (SG) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. The highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of Capnocytophaga (formerly Bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. The phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. Most of the 'Bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, Bact. bivius and a new species, Bact. denticola, formed another group. Another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to Bact. oralis such as Bact. buccalis and Bact. pentosaceus. The less saccharolytic strains of Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and Bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. The low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of Bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. The non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. The separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.
