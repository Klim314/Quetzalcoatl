TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.
