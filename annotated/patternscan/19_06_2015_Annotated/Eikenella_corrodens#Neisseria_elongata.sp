TI  == dialects of the dna uptake sequence in neisseriaceae.
AB  == in all sexual organisms, adaptations exist that secure the safe reassortment of homologous alleles and prevent the intrusion of potentially hazardous alien dna.  some bacteria engage in a simple form of sex known as transformation. in the human pathogen neisseria meningitidis and in related bacterial species, transformation by exogenous dna is regulated by the presence of a specific dna uptake sequence (dus), which is present in thousands of copies in the respective  genomes. dus affects transformation by limiting dna uptake and recombination in favour of homologous dna. the specific mechanisms of dus-dependent genetic transformation have remained elusive. bioinformatic analyses of family neisseriaceae genomes reveal eight distinct variants of dus. these variants are here termed dus dialects, and their effect on interspecies commutation is demonstrated. each of the dus dialects is remarkably conserved within each species and is distributed consistent with a robust neisseriaceae phylogeny based on core genome sequences. the impact of individual single nucleotide transversions in dus on meningococcal transformation and on dna binding and uptake is analysed. the results show that a dus core 5'-ctg-3' is required for transformation and that transversions in this core reduce dna uptake more than two orders of magnitude although the level of dna binding remains less affected.  distinct dus dialects are efficient barriers to interspecies recombination in n.  meningitidis, n. elongata, kingella denitrificans, and eikenella corrodens, despite the presence of the core sequence. the degree of similarity between the dus dialect of the recipient species and the donor dna directly correlates with the level of transformation and dna binding and uptake. finally, dus-dependent transformation is documented in the genera eikenella and kingella for the first time. the results presented here advance our understanding of the function and evolution of dus and genetic transformation in bacteria, and define the phylogenetic relationships within the neisseriaceae family.

TI  == phylogeny of species in the family neisseriaceae isolated from human dental plaque and description of kingella oralis sp. nov [corrected].
AB  == fourteen human periodontal isolates recovered from a purported eikenella corrodens-selective medium containing 1 microgram of clindamycin per ml displayed biochemical traits which differed from those described for e. corrodens. these organisms were gram-negative rods which corroded agar. the isolates were oxidase  positive and urease, indole, and esculin negative. they differed from e. corrodens in catalase, nitrate reduction, lysine decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities. one isolate, strain ub-294, was presumptively identified as kingella denitrificans. a second isolate, strain ub-204, differed from e. corrodens by being catalase positive and nitrate reduction negative. twelve isolates, including strain ub-38t (t = type strain), were phenotypically similar to kingella kingae except that they did not produce acid from maltose and were not beta-hemolytic. essentially complete (1,480-base) 16s rrna sequences were determined for strains ub-38t, ub-204, and ub-294 and the type strains of neisseria animalis, neisseria canis, neisseria denitrificans, neisseria elongata, neisseria flavescens, neisseria macaca, and neisseria polysaccharea. these sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of six other species belonging to the family neisseriaceae. on the basis of the results of the comparative sequence analysis, ub-294 was confirmed as a k. denitrificans strain, ub-204 was identified as a member of a new species which may belong in the genus  eikenella, and ub-38t was identified as a member of a new species of the genus kingella, for which we propose the name kingella oralis [corrected]. since strain ub-204 was the only representative of a new species, it was not named.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == differentiation of some species of neisseriaceae and other bacterial groups by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == dna-dna hybridization using total genomic dna probes may represent a way of differentiating between miscellaneous bacterial species. this was studied with type and reference strains of 20 species in moraxella, kingella, and other selected gram-negative groups. both radioactive and biotin labelling were employed. most of the species examined were easily distinguished, such as moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, m.(b.) ovis, m. atlantae, m. phenylpyruvica, m. osloensis, neisseria elongata, n. meningitidis, kingella kingae, k. indologenes, k. dentrificans, oligella urethralis, eikenella corrodens, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, gardnerella vaginalis, and df-2. this reflected the extent of the genetic distances between them as a basis for identification by hybridization. there was some clustering in the moraxella group. especially the closely related moraxella nonliquefaciens, m. lacunata and m. bovis showed strong hybridization affinities. this leads to potential problems in distinguishing these three species from each other by dna-dna hybridization with total genomic probes alone.
