TI == new iron acquisition system in bacteroidetes.
AB == capnocytophaga canimorsus, a dog mouth commensal and a member of the bacteroidetes phylum, causes rare but often fatal septicemia in humans that have been in contact with a dog. here, we show that c. canimorsus strains isolated from human infections grow readily in heat-inactivated human serum and that this property depends on a typical polysaccharide utilization locus (pul), namely, pul3 in strain cc5. pul are a hallmark of bacteroidetes, and they encode various products, including surface protein complexes that capture and process polysaccharides or glycoproteins. the archetype system is the bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sus system, devoted to starch utilization. unexpectedly, pul3 conferred the capacity to acquire iron from serotransferrin (stf), and this capacity required each of the seven encoded proteins, indicating that a whole sus-like machinery is acting as an iron capture system (ics), a new and unexpected function for sus-like machinery. no siderophore could be detected in the culture supernatant of c. canimorsus, suggesting that the sus-like machinery captures iron directly from transferrin, but this could not be formally demonstrated. the seven genes of the ics were found in the genomes of several opportunistic pathogens from the capnocytophaga and prevotella genera, in different isolates of the severe poultry pathogen riemerella anatipestifer, and in strains of bacteroides fragilis and odoribacter splanchnicus isolated from human infections. thus, this study describes a new type of ics that evolved in bacteroidetes from a polysaccharide utilization system and most likely represents an important virulence factor in this group.

TI == metagenomic analysis of the gastric microbiota cultivable from a patient with gastritis concomitant with barrett's esophagus.
AB == barrett's esophagus is a distal metaplasia characterized by the transformation of squamous mucosa into columnar mucosa. this esophageal phenotype is a product not only of the chronic reflux of gastric acids, but also by microorganisms that colonize the oral cavity and stomach. two classes of microbiota can be identified in barrett's esophagus; microbiota type i is associated with the normal esophagus and type ii with an inflamed esophagus. the present study describes the gastric microbiota of a patient with antral gastritis concomitant with barrett's esophagus absent infection with helicobacter pylori. gastric biopsies were obtained following the protocol of sydney and following ethical practices. the isolates were cultivated under microaerophilic conditions on columbia agar supplemented with isovitalex and 7% sterile blood. extracted dna was sequenced using 454-gs and the results analyzed on the mg-rast server. gram negative isolates were found and bacteria resistant to levofloxacin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. the phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria, the genus bacteroides and the species group bacteroides fragilis were most abundant. functionally, the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and to a lesser extent, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were most dominant, and of which the enzymes beta-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.21), beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23) and beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase (ec 3.2.1.52) were most dominant. the findings of this study, because they are of only one case may probably suggest a possible pathogenic role, previously undescribed for bacteroides fragilis, associated with human gastritis when concomitant esophageal pathology exists.

TI == a commensal bacterial product elicits and modulates migratory capacity of cd39(+) cd4 t regulatory subsets in the suppression of neuroinflammation.
AB == tolerance established by host-commensal interactions regulates host immunity at both local mucosal and systemic levels. the intestinal commensal strain bacteroides fragilis elicits immune tolerance, at least in part, via the expression capsular polysaccharide a (psa). how such niche-specific commensal microbial elements regulate extra-intestinal immune responses, as in the brain, remains largely unknown. we have recently shown that oral treatment with psa suppresses neuro-inflammation elicited during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. this protection is dependent upon the expansion of immune-regulatory cd4 t cells (treg) expressing cd39, an ectonucleotidase. here, we further show that cd39 modulation of purinergic signals enhances migratory phenotypes of both total cd4 t cells and foxp3(+) cd4 tregs at central nervous system (cns) lymphoid-draining sites in eae in vivo and promotes their migration in vitro. these changes are noted during psa treatment, which leads to heightened accumulation of cd39(+) cd4 tregs in the cns. deficiency of cd39 abrogates accumulation of treg during eae, and is accompanied by elevated th1/th17 signals in the cns and in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. our results demonstrate that immune-modulatory commensal bacterial products impact the migratory patterns of cd4 treg during cns autoimmunity via the regulation of cd39. these observations provide clues as to how intestinal commensal microbiome is able to modulate treg functions and impact host immunity in the distal site.

TI == a pilot study on the effect of lactobacillus casei zhang on intestinal microbiota parameters in chinese subjects of different age.
AB == ageing of the population is an imminent global problem. lactobacillus casei zhang (lcz) was isolated from inner mongolian fermented milk, koumiss. lcz possesses numerous probiotic properties in in vitro tests and in animal models. however, it has never been tested in any human trial. in the current study, the impact of oral consumption of lcz on different age groups was tested. chinese subjects, including 10 young, 7 middle-aged and 7 elderly volunteers (with mean age of 24.3, 47.6 and 64.7, respectively), were recruited. each subject took 10.6 log10 cfu lcz daily for a continuous period of 28 days. several parameters, including the amounts of lcz and four selected groups of bacteria, change of bacterial diversity, short chain fatty acids (scfa) and total bile acids (tba), were monitored in faecal samples collected from the subjects before starting, during and after stopping oral lcz consumption. the consumption of lcz exhibited beneficial effects to the subjects by modulating faecal microbiota in a temporal manner with a prolonged elevation of scfa and reduction of tba. the potentially harmful pseudomonas and acinetobacter genera were suppressed by the probiotic administration. furthermore, a moderately divergent response was observed in the indigenous gut populations of bifidobacterium and bacteroides fragilis group in different age subjects. taken together, the current study has provided proof on the positive effect of probiotic consumption and crucial insights into the design and application of probiotic-based products to users of different age segments.

TI == in vitro effect of antibiotics on biofilm formation by bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated from intestinal microbiota of dogs and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB == the bacteroides fragilis group strains colonize the intestinal tract of dogs as commensal bacteria. nevertheless, they can be opportunistic pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality rates in dogs, like in oral infections, abscesses and wound infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility in b. fragilis strains isolated from dogs intestinal microbiota and to evaluate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of some antimicrobials on biofilm formation. a total of 30 b. fragilis group strains were tested for susceptibility to ten antimicrobial agents by broth microdilution method. thirteen b. fragilis strains were tested for biofilm formation and the biofilm producer strains were chosen to evaluate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobials on biofilm formation. the isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, metronidazole, imipenem and chloramphenicol. tetracycline and clindamycin were active against 50% and 33% of the strains, respectively. when biofilm-forming strains were grown in the presence of sub-mics of imipenem and metronidazole, the inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. in contrast, enrofloxacin at (1/2) mic caused a significant increase in biofilm formation in two of four strains examined. in conclusion, the b. fragilis group strains isolated were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials tested and the sub-mic concentrations of imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were able to inhibit the biofilm formation.

TI == design and in vitro evaluation of a novel poly(methacrylic acid)/metronidazole antibacterial nanogel as an oral dosage form.
AB == to overcome the undesirable side-effects of metronidazole (mtz), ethylene glycol  dimethacrylate is used as the cross-linker, and a series of poly(methacrylic acid) (pmaa) nanogels were prepared to load the mtz. we investigated the morphology, size, in vitro release property in the simulated gastrointestinal medium, long-term antibacterial performance against bacteroides fragilis, cytotoxicity, stability and activity of this novel mtz/pmaa nanogel. the results indicate that the mtz/pmaa nanogel sustained the release of mtz in long-term antibacterial activity in the simulated gastrointestinal medium. this mtz/pmaa nanogel exhibits less cytotoxicity than mtz alone, suggesting that mtz/pmaa nanogel is a more useful dosage form than mtz for mild-to-moderate clostridium difficile infections. the novel aspects of this study include the synthesis of a nanogel and the three-phase study of the release profile, which might be useful for other researchers in this field.

TI == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI == microbiota modulate behavioral and physiological abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
AB == neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (asd), are defined by core behavioral impairments; however, subsets of individuals display a spectrum of gastrointestinal (gi) abnormalities. we demonstrate gi barrier defects and microbiota alterations in the maternal immune activation (mia) mouse model that is known to display features of asd. oral treatment of mia offspring with the human commensal bacteroides fragilis corrects gut permeability, alters microbial composition, and ameliorates defects in communicative, stereotypic, anxiety-like and sensorimotor behaviors. mia offspring display an altered serum metabolomic profile, and b. fragilis modulates levels of several metabolites. treating naive mice with a metabolite that is increased by mia and restored by b. fragilis causes certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that gut bacterial effects on the host metabolome impact behavior. taken together, these findings support a gut-microbiome-brain connection in a mouse model of asd and identify a potential probiotic therapy for gi and particular behavioral symptoms in human neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI == proteomic changes in bacteroides fragilis exposed to subinhibitory concentration  of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB == bacteroides fragilis is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from clinical specimens and piperacillin/tazobactam is among the drugs that can be used to treat polymicrobial infections in which this bacteria is often involved. during antibiotic therapy, inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics are always followed by subinhibitory concentrations which can generate phenotypic changes in bacteria. so, in this study we aimed to evaluate changes in the proteomic profile of b. fragilis grown in a sub-mic of ptz, using 2-d electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time of-flight. analysis of the 2-de gels showed 18 spots with significantly different volume percentages between experimental conditions and 12 were successfully identified by ms/ms. two proteins with decreased abundance in sub-mic condition were involved in the glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase), others two involved in amino acid metabolism (oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase ii and dihydrodipicolinate reductase), and finally, one protein involved in fatty acid metabolism (udp-n-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase). among the proteins with increased abundance, we founded three atp synthase (alpha, beta, and alpha type v), which could be involved in antibiotic bacterial resistance by efflux pump, one protein involved in glycolysis (enolase), and one involved in protein degradation (aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase). in conclusion, our data show overall changes in the proteome of b. fragilis conducted by sub-mic of ptz, whose consequences on bacterial physiology deserve further investigation.

TI == discrimination based on gly and arg/ser at position 673 between dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 7 and dpp11, widely distributed dpps in pathogenic and environmental gram-negative bacteria.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, expresses the novel asp/glu-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 11 (ohara-nemoto, y. et al. (2011) j. biol. chem. 286, 38115-38127), which has been categorized as a member of the s46/dpp7 family that is preferential for hydrophobic residues at the p1 position. from that finding, 129 gene products constituting five clusters from the phylum bacteroidetes have been newly annotated to either dpp7 or dpp11, whereas the remaining 135 members, mainly from the largest phylum proteobacteria, have yet to be assigned. in this study, the substrate specificities of the five clusters and an unassigned group were determined with recombinant dpps from typical species, i.e., p. gingivalis, capnocytophaga gingivalis, flavobacterium psychrophilum, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, and shewanella putrefaciens. consequently, clusters 1, 3, and 5 were found to be dpp7 with rather broad substrate specificity, and clusters 2 and 4 were dpp11. an unassigned s. putrefaciens dpp carrying ser(673) exhibited asp/glu-specificity more preferable to glu, in contrast to the asp preference of dpp11 with arg(673) from bacteroidetes species. mutagenesis experiments revealed that arg(673)/ser(673) were indispensable for the asp/glu-specificity of dpp11, and that the broad specificity of dpp7 was mediated by gly(673). taken together with the distribution of the two genes, all 264 members of the s46 family could be attributed to either dpp7 or dpp11 by an amino acid at position 673. a more compelling phylogenic tree based on the conserved c-terminal region suggested two gene duplication events in the phylum bacteroidetes, one causing the development of dpp7 and dpp11 with altered substrate specificities, and the other producing an additional dpp7 in the genus bacteroides.

AB == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

AB == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains have been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are needed for clarification. here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the cell numbers of fecal etbf in a healthy population. among 420 healthy adults, 38 subjects were found to be etbf carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%. among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium longum bb536 (bb536y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group (milk group). the cell numbers of etbf and the dominant species of the b. fragilis group were measured by a quantitative pcr method. compared with the baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of etbf at week 8 in the bb536y group but not in the milk group. linear mixed models analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes of etbf cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. these results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating etbf in the microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future. this is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on etbf in the microbiota.

AB == colon-residing bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis, can cause a range of serious clinical infections. photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (pact) may be a novel treatment option for these multidrug resistant organisms. the aim of this study was to formulate a eudragit(r)-based drug delivery system, via hot melt extrusion (hme), for targeting colonic release of photosensitizer. the susceptibility of e. faecalis and b. fragilis to pact mediated by methylene blue (mb), meso-tetra(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine tetra-tosylate (tmp), or 5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl-ester (h-ala) was determined, with tetrachlorodecaoxide (tcdo), an oxygen-releasing compound, added in some studies. results show that, for mb, an average of 30% of the total drug load was released over a 6-h period. for tmp and h-ala, these values were 50% and 16% respectively. no drug was released in the acidic media. levels of e. faecalis and b. fragilis were reduced by up to 4.67 and 7.73 logs, respectively, on pact exposure under anaerobic conditions, with increased kill associated with tcdo. with these formulations, photosensitizer release could potentially be targeted to the colon, and colon-residing pathogens killed by pact. tcdo could be used in vivo to generate oxygen, which could significantly impact on the success of pact in the clinic.

TI == trans locus inhibitors limit concomitant polysaccharide synthesis in the human gut symbiont bacteroides fragilis.
AB == bacteroides is an abundant genus of bacteria of the human intestinal microbiota.  bacteroides species synthesize a large number of capsular polysaccharides (ps), a biological property not shared with closely related oral species, suggesting importance for intestinal survival. bacteroides fragilis, for example, synthesizes eight capsular polysaccharides per strain, each of which phase varies via inversion of the promoters located upstream of seven of the eight polysaccharide biosynthesis operons. in a single cell, many of these polysaccharide loci promoters can be simultaneously oriented on for transcription of the downstream biosynthesis operons. here, we demonstrate that despite the promoter orientations, concomitant transcription of multiple polysaccharide loci within a cell is inhibited. the proteins encoded by the second gene of each of these eight loci, collectively designated the upxz proteins, inhibit the synthesis of heterologous polysaccharides. these unique proteins interfere with the ability of upxy proteins encoded by other polysaccharide loci to function in transcriptional antitermination of their respective operon. the eight upxzs have different inhibitory spectra, thus establishing a hierarchical regulatory network for polysaccharide synthesis. limitation of concurrent polysaccharide synthesis strongly suggests that these bacteria evolved this property as an evasion-type mechanism to avoid killing by polysaccharide-targeting factors in the ecosystem.

TI == a polysaccharide from the human commensal bacteroides fragilis protects against cns demyelinating disease.
AB == the intestinal microbiome may have a critical roll in susceptibility or resistance to immune-mediated diseases. alterations of the gut microflora after oral antibiotic treatment can regulate encephalomyelitis (eae), an animal model for human multiple sclerosis (ms). we now show that a zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide a (psa) of bacteroides fragilis can protect against central nervous system demyelinating disease. oral administration with purified psa protected mice against eae prophylactic and therapeutically. psa treatment enhanced cd103 expressing dendritic cells (dcs) that accumulated in the cervical lymph nodes. exposure of naive dcs to psa induced the conversion of naive cd4(+) t cells into interleukin (il)-10-producing foxp3(+)treg cells. protection against eae was completely abrogated in il-10-deficient mice. our results show an important role for a molecule from human commensal bacteria in protecting against eae and suggest the possibility for protection in ms.

TI == the structurally similar, penta-acylated lipopolysaccharides of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides elicit strikingly different innate immune responses.
AB == lipid a structural modifications can substantially impact the host's inflammatory response to bacterial lps. bacteroides fragilis, an opportunistic pathogen associated with life-threatening sepsis and intra-abdominal abscess formation, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a symbiont pivotal for proper host intestinal tissue development, both produce an immunostimulatory lps comprised of penta-acylated lipid a. under defined conditions, porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen associated with periodontitis, also produces an lps bearing a penta-acylated lipid a. however, this lps preparation is 100-1000 times less potent than bacteroides lps in stimulating endothelial cells. we analyzed bacteroides and p. gingivalis lipid a structures using maldi-tof ms and gas chromatography to determine the structural basis for this phenomenon. even though both bacteroides and p. gingivalis lipid a molecules are penta-acylated and mono-phosphorylated, subtle differences in mass and fatty acid content could account for the observed difference in lps potency. this fatty acid heterogeneity is also responsible for the peak "clusters" observed in the mass spectra and obfuscates the correlation between lps structure and immunostimulatory ability. further, we show the difference in potency between bacteroides and p. gingivalis lps is tlr4-dependent. altogether, the data suggest subtle changes in lipid a structure may profoundly impact the host's innate immune response.

TI == metronidazole-loaded bioabsorbable films as local antibacterial treatment of infected periodontal pockets.
AB == background: periodontal disease is infectious in nature and leads to an inflammatory response. it arises from the accumulation of subgingival bacterial plaque and leads to the loss of attachment, increased probing depth, and bone loss. it is one of the world's most prevalent chronic diseases. in this study we developed and studied metronidazole-loaded 50/50 poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (pdlga), 75/25 pdlga, and poly(dl-lactic acid) (pdlla) films. these films are designed to be inserted into the periodontal pocket and treat infections with controlled-release metronidazole for >or=1 month. methods: the structured films were prepared using the solution-casting technique. concentrated solutions and high solvent-evaporation rates were used to get most of the drug located in the bulk, i.e., in whole film's volume. the effects of copolymer composition and drug content on the release profile, cell growth, and bacterial inhibition were investigated. results: the pdlla and 75/25 pdlga films generally exhibited a low- or medium-burst release followed by a moderate release at an approximately constant rate, whereas the 50/50 pdlga films exhibited a biphasic release profile. the drug released from films loaded with 10% weight/weight metronidazole resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial viability within several days. when exposed to human gingival fibroblasts in cell culture conditions, these films maintained their normal fibroblastic features. conclusions: this study enabled the understanding of metronidazole-release kinetics from bioabsorbable polymeric films. the developed systems demonstrated good biocompatibility and the ability to inhibit bacteroides fragilis growth; therefore, they may be useful in the treatment of periodontal diseases.

AB == capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from canine oral flora, has been isolated throughout the world from severe human infections caused by dog bites. due to the low level of evolutionary relationship to proteobacteria, genetic methods suitable for the genus capnocytophaga needed to be established. here, we show that tn4351, derived from bacteroides fragilis, could be introduced by conjugation into c. canimorsus and conferred resistance to erythromycin. by mapping and sequencing a naturally occurring plasmid isolated from a clinical isolate of c. canimorsus, we identified a repa gene that allowed us to construct escherichia coli-capnocytophaga shuttle vectors. most commonly used antibiotic markers were not functional in c. canimorsus, but cefoxitin (cfxa), tetracycline (tetq), and erythromycin (ermf) resistances could be used as markers for plasmid maintenance in c. canimorsus and even in some other capnocytophaga spp. shuttle vectors were introduced into c. canimorsus either by conjugation using the origin of transfer (orit) of rp4 or by electrotransformation. taking advantage of the promoter of ermf, an expression vector was constructed. finally, a method that allows site-directed mutagenesis is described. all these genetic tools pave the way, not only for molecular studies of the pathogenesis of c. canimorsus, but also for studies of other oral capnocytophaga species.

AB == the purpose of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of once-daily versus multiple dose regimens of metronidazole in inpatients with serious/systemic bacteroides fragilis infections, i.e., intraabdominal/pelvic and diabetic foot infections. a retrospective chart review was performed on 145 adult inpatients who received combination therapy with metronidazole for b. fragilis abdominal/pelvic infection or diabetic (deep) foot infections/osteomyelitis. exclusion criteria included metronidazole given for indications other than those mentioned, patients who received only one dose of metronidazole, and patients who received oral metronidazole only. the 145 patients were in two groups: 66 patients in the metronidazole 1 g (i.v.) q24h (group a) and 79 patients who received metronidazole 500 mg (i.v./p.o.) q6-8h dosing (group b). patient demographics included age, gender, indications of metronidazole, concomitant, antibiotics, and co-morbidities. data collection also included length of stay (los), antibiotic days, and clinical outcomes. the 145 patients in our study had a mean age of 66 years, 61% were female and 39% male. most patients were being treated for definitive intraabdominal/pelvic infections (82%), or probable intraabdominal/pelvic infections (22%). only 6% had deep diabetic foot infections of osteomyelitis (percentages exceed 100% since a patient can have more than one indication) and were included since b. fragilis is also and important pathogen in diabetic osteomyelitis. group a patients had more concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05 respectively, chi-square test for trend) than group b patients. there were no statistically significant differences between groups a and b for los and antibiotic days (p = 0.42 and p = 0.92 respectively, by rank-sum test), but after adjusting for concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities group a patients had clinically shorter los and fewer antibiotic days. unadjusted mortality and failure rates were non-significantly higher in group a (relative ratios of 12.1%/6.3% = 6.3% = 1.91 and 18.2%/ 10.1% = 1.80 respectively), but after adjusting for concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities with stratification analysis, groups a and b were virtually the same (risk differences of </= 1%). the authors conclude that for b. fragilis infections, as part of combination therapy, metronidazole 1 g (i.v.) q 24h appears to eb as efficacious and not inferior to multiply-dosed metronidazole regimens. once daily metronidazole, i.e., 1 g (i.v.) q24h for the treatment of serious systemic infections where b. fragilis is an important co-pathogen (intraabdominal/pelvic and deep diabetic foot infections) has pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-economic advantages.

TI == lemierre syndrome associated with dental infections. report of one case and review of the literature.
AB == the first publication on lemierre syndrome appears in 1936 by lemierre. it is defined as an "oropharynx bacterial infection characterized by the thrombophlebitis in the internal jugular vein, derived in a systemic septic embolism". in 81% of the cases, the fusobacterium necrophorum is the most frequent etiologic agent. fever is the most common symptom, but it can depending on the primary infection, tonsillitis, mastoiditis or odontogenic infection. according to the literature the mortality is very low, but with a significant morbidity, that is why the diagnosis and early treatment is very important. the diagnosis it's clinical, even though the ct scan and other diagnosis methods (echography, mri) help to determine the extent of the infection. it's necessary to administer the antibiotics endovenous at high dose, (keeping in mind that the most frequent micro organism is anaerobic), and vital support measures if necessary. we present a case report of lemierre syndrome associated to an odonthogenic infection caused by the 4.8 molar.

TI == the rpry response regulator of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe associated with chronic adult periodontitis. its ecological niche is the gingival crevice, where the organism adapts to the challenges of the infectious process such as host defence and bacterial products. bacterial responses to environmental changes are partly regulated by two-component signal transduction systems. several intact systems were annotated in the genome of p. gingivalis, as well as an orphan regulator encoding a homologue of rpry, a response regulator from bacteroides fragilis. with the goal of defining the environmental cues that activate rpry in p. gingivalis, we used several strategies to identify its regulon. results from gene expression and dna-protein binding assays identified target genes that were either involved in transport functions or associated with oxidative stress, and indicated that rpry can act as an activator and a repressor. rpry positively activated the primary sodium pump, nadh : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (nqr), and rpry protein also interacted with the promoter regions of nqra genes from b. fragilis and vibrio cholerae. given that gingival bleeding and infiltration of host defence cells are symptoms of periodontal infection, iron products released from blood and reactive oxygen species from polymorphonuclear leucocytes may be potential inducers of the rpry regulon.

TI == transcriptional organization, regulation and role of the porphyromonas gingivalis w83 hmu haemin-uptake locus.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral bacterium associated with periodontal disease,  requires haemin for growth. although several multigenic clusters encoding haemin-uptake systems are present on the genome of p. gingivalis, little is known regarding their transcriptional organization and expression. this study identified a 23 kda iron-regulated haemin-binding protein encoded by a larger than previously reported variant of hmuy. it was shown that the hmu locus is larger than previously reported and is composed of six genes, hmuyrstuv, encoding a novel hybrid haemin-uptake system. the locus has an operonic organization and the transcriptional start site is located 292 bp upstream of hmuy. the data indicate that the regulation of the operon is iron-dependent. interestingly, differential regulation within the operon was demonstrated, resulting in excess of the hmuyr message encoding the outer-membrane proteins when compared to the full-length transcript. in addition, the hmuy transcript is more prevalent than the hmur transcript. secondary structure analysis of the hmuyrstuv mrna predicted the formation of several potential stem-loops in the 5' ends of hmur- and hmus-specific mrnas, consistent with the differential regulation observed. finally, it was demonstrated that haemin binding and uptake are elevated in iron-depleted conditions and are reduced 45 % and 70 %, respectively, in an hmu-deficient strain when compared to the parental strain, indicating that the hmu locus plays a major role in haemin acquisition in p. gingivalis. since homologues of the hmu locus were also found in bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella intermedia, these findings may have implications for a better understanding of haemin acquisition in those organisms as well.

TI == superoxide dismutase-encoding gene of the obligate anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated by the redox-sensing transcription activator oxyr.
AB == inspection of the genomic dna sequence of the oral anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis reveals that the micro-organism possesses the peroxide-sensing transcription activator oxyr, but not the superoxide-sensing transcription factor soxr. investigatation of oxidative-stress-responsive proteins in p. gingivalis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that two proteins were predominantly upregulated in oxidative conditions. in a p. gingivalis oxyr mutant these two proteins were not induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. by n-terminal amino acid sequencing, the two proteins were found to be superoxide dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, encoded by sod and ahpc, respectively. northern blot and lacz fusion analyses revealed that p. gingivalis sod and ahpc were positively regulated by oxyr. primer extension analysis located the promoter regions of sod and ahpc, and putative -35 boxes of these promoters were found immediately adjacent to their putative oxyr-binding sequences. moreover, the promoter regions of sod and ahpc had the ability to bind p. gingivalis oxyr protein. these results demonstrate that p. gingivalis sod is one of the oxyr regulons, suggesting that oxyr functions as an intracellular redox sensor rather than a peroxide sensor in this organism. a sod gene of bacteroides fragilis, which is taxonomically related to p. gingivalis, is inducible by redox stresses but not controlled by its oxyr. a dna fragment including the b. fragilis sod promoter region could bind the p. gingivalis oxyr protein; however, a putative oxyr binding sequence within the dna fragment was 14 bases distant from a putative -35 box of its promoter.

TI == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

AB == sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family were found in the bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. disruption mutants were made to the mexb homologs of the four genes most similar to pseudomonas aeruginosa mexb. reverse transcription-pcr was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmea (the mexa homolog). one of these disruption mutants (in bmeb, the mexb homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. the gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmea, were cloned in a hypersensitive escherichia coli host. the resultant transformants carrying b. fragilis bmeab were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower mics for the b. fragilis bmeb disruption mutants than for the parental strain. the putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmea, bmeb, and bmec (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with oprm). addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and phe-arg beta-naphthylamide (mc-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for rnd pumps in p. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered mics in the parental strain but not in the bmeb disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeb pump is affected by these inhibitors. this is the first description of rnd type pumps in the genus bacteroides.

TI == pharmacodynamics of pulse dosing versus standard dosing: in vitro metronidazole activity against bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB == pulse dosing is a novel approach to dosing that produces escalating antibiotic levels early in the dosing interval followed by a prolonged dose-free period. antibiotic is frontloaded by means of four sequential bolus injections, after which antibiotic levels are allowed to diminish until the next dose. this study compares standard thrice-daily dosing and pulse dosing of metronidazole against bacteroides spp. in an in vitro model. two american type culture collection bacteroides fragilis isolates (metronidazole mic for each organism = 1 mg/liter) were exposed to metronidazole for 48 or 96 h. human pharmacokinetics were simulated for an oral 500-mg dose given every 8 h (maximum concentration of drug [c(max)] = 12 mg/liter; half-life = 8 h; area under the curve [auc] = 294 mg . h/liter) and for pulse dosing. pulses, each producing an increase in metronidazole concentration of 9 mg/liter, were administered at times 0, 2, 4, and 6 h of each 24-h cycle, with a targeted half-life of 8 h (auc = 347 mg . h/liter). a metronidazole-resistant b. fragilis strain (metronidazole mic = 32 mg/liter) was exposed to both dosing regimens and, additionally, to a regimen of 1,500 mg administered once daily (c(max) = 36 mg/liter; auc = 364 mg . h/liter). furthermore, regimens against one b. fragilis isolate and one b. thetaiotaomicron isolate corresponding to one-fourth and one-eighth of the thrice-daily and pulse dosing regimens, mimicking peak metronidazole concentrations achieved in abscesses, were simulated in 48-h experiments (metronidazole mic = 1 mg/liter). time-kill curves were generated for each experiment and analyzed for bactericidal activity, defined as a bacterial burden reduction >/= 3 log(10) cfu/ml. the results of paired (wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test) and nonpaired (mann-whitney test) statistical analyses conducted on time to 3 log(10) kill data and area under the kill curve data from each of the thrice-daily dosing experiments versus each of the pulse dosing experiments were considered not significant for a given isolate-dosing regimen combination. the thrice-daily dosing, pulse dosing, and once-daily dosing regimens all exhibited bactericidal activity. metronidazole administered in standard or pulse dosing fashion was highly active against both susceptible and resistant strains of bacteroides spp.

AB == we used an anaerobic infection model capable of simulating human serum pharmacokinetic parameters (c(max), c(min), half-life, and auc) to compare the activity of oral immediate-release (ir) and extended-release (er) mtz formulations. four oral regimens of mtz plus a control regimen were simulated in the model: [i] (ir) 500 mg q8h, [ii] er 750 mg q12h, [iii] er 750 mg q24h, and [iv] er 1500 mg q24h. two clinical bacteroides fragilis isolates (mics 0.5, 4.0 microg/ml) and two non-fragilis bacteroides isolates (mics 0.5, 3 microg/ml) were studied. all four oral mtz regimens exhibited rapid, bactericidal activity (> or =3-log(10) decrease from the starting inoculum) within 12 h against both fragilis and non-fragilis bacteroides isolates. overall, no appreciable difference in the rate of bacteria killing was noted among the four mtz formulations against either b. fragilis isolates (p = 0.907, 0.737) or non-fragilis isolates (p = 0.809, 0.768). we conclude that er mtz dosed at 12 or 24-h intervals possesses equivalent bactericidal activity to standard ir mtz dosed every eight hours against susceptible bacteroides spp.

TI == identification and cloning of genes from porphyromonas gingivalis after mutagenesis with a modified tn4400 transposon from bacteroides fragilis.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the bacteroides transposon tn4351. characterization of tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing tn4351. in this study, we mutagenized p. gingivalis with a modified version of the bacteroides fragilis transposon tn4400. plasmid pyt646b carrying the transposon was mobilized from escherichia coli to p. gingivalis atcc 33277 by conjugation. both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). however, the inverse transposon (tn4400') contains a pbr322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus, the cloning of disrupted genomic dnas from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into e. coli. thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by southern hybridization. by this procedure the disrupted genes from p. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.

TI == activities of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtp proteinase determined by construction of prtp-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in bacteroides species.
AB == prtp is a major cysteine proteinase of porphyromonas gingivalis. the gene encoding this proteinase, prtp, was cloned into the escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vectors pfd288 and pfd340 and was expressed in bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pfd288, or a bacteroides promoter present on pfd340. proteolytically active prtp was detected by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. the proteinase was recovered from bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. lys-amidolytic activity, but not arg-amidolytic activity, was detected. prtp was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. it also was inhibited by nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck) and, to a lesser extent, h-d-tyr-l-pro-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (yprck) and was relatively insensitive to edta and leupeptin. neither b. fragilis atcc 25285(pfd340-prtp) cells nor the chaps extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. furthermore, p. gingivalis w12, atcc 33277, kdp110, and hg66 with knockout mutations in prtp were constructed by allelic replacement. unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. these strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a lys-specific peptide substrate. this report presents the results of the first characterization of the prtp proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other p. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of p. gingivalis cells defective in the production of prtp.

TI == the translational hop junction and the 5' transcriptional start site for the prevotella loescheii adhesin encoded by plaa.
AB == the prevotella loescheii adhesin gene, plaa, contains a coding gap between a small open reading frame (orf-1) and a large open reading frame (orf-2). translation of the plaa mrna requires bypassing this 29-nt coding gap on the plaa transcript. we have determined the n-terminal peptide sequence of the so34 adhesin beyond the gap sequence. this sequence shows that the peptide junction between orf-1 and orf-2 is continuous in the adhesin and supports the conclusion that synthesis of the so34 adhesin occurs by a ribosomal hop mechanism. to elucidate upstream signals, we used the 5' race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) technique to map the start point of the plaa mrna. dna sequencing of plasmids with the 5' race products placed the 5' end of plaa mrna 270 nt upstream from the plaa start codon. a region corresponding to a bacteroides fragilis promoter consensus sequence precedes this start site.

TI == rapid and sensitive assay for detection of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis.
AB == bacteroides fragilis is an obligatory anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium found among the normal intestinal flora of humans. enterotoxigenic strains of b. fragilis (etbf) have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. the enterotoxin of etbf induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal segments and cytotoxic response in ht29/c1 cells. by using a pair of monoclonal antibodies (mabs; mab c3 and mab 4h8) specific for the lipopolysaccharide of b. fragilis, an assay based on immunomagnetic separation (ims) in combination with pcr (ims-pcr) was developed. after dna extraction, a 294-bp fragment was amplified. the specificity of the ims-pcr assay was evaluated by adding previously isolated and confirmed etbf strains to normal fecal samples. all fecal samples to which etbf strains were added were positive, showing a 100% specificity. the spiked fecal samples were also used for evaluation of the sensitivity of the assay. the detection limit was found to be approximately 50 cfu/g of feces. by this method 10 clinical fecal samples (5 from patients with diarrhea and 5 from healthy controls) were examined. the results of pcr were in accordance with the results of the ht29/c1 cell assay for all samples. the minimum time to retrieval of the final result by the ims-pcr method is 36 h. the proposed ims-pcr assay is rapid and sensitive for the direct detection of etbf in stool samples.

TI == characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates following active immunization with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and bacteroides fragilis.
AB == periodontal disease is an infectious disease manifested by the progressive change of a healthy resident commensal microbiota to a pathogenic one characterized by a specific microbiota. thus, the prospect for the use of selected bacteria or their antigens as a vaccine to interfere with the microbial changes and resulting progression of periodontal tissue destruction has been proposed. as a first step in examining the use of bacterial antigens as immunogens in periodontitis, this study characterized the humoral immune response in macaca fascicularis after systemic immunization with intact porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and bacteroides fragilis. parental immunization of the nonhuman primate with the intact bacteria resulted in the production of specific and significantly elevated levels of antibodies to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia, with the predominant isotype being immunoglobulin g (igg). in contrast, the principal response to the nonoral, intestinal bacterium, b. fragilis, was of the igm isotype. immunization increased igg, igm, and iga antibody by 14-227 fold to p. gingivalis and 8-108 fold to p. intermedia. the level of serum iga antibody increased (77-227 fold). the kinetics of the antibody response post-immunization and post-ligation differed with respect to each of the bacteria tested. igg antibody to p. gingivalis increased through week 16 of the experiment and remained elevated above baseline through week 32. the igg antibody level to p. intermedia peaked at 4 weeks following the third immunization and decreased post-ligation to near baseline levels by week 16. characterization of the immune response after active immunization in the nonhuman primate has demonstrated a substantial and specific increase in antibody response which was sustained for several weeks. the insights obtained from these studies should help optimize the potential for immunologic interference with progressing periodontitis.

AB == this paper reviews new information on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections. the bacteriology of these infections is complex, reflecting the bacteria that usually colonize the vagina and cervix. in general, these infections are polymicrobial in nature: the most frequently isolated microorganisms are gram-negative facultative aerobes, anaerobes, chlamydia trachomatis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. antibiotic regimens that do provide coverage of these pathogens showed unacceptably high failure rates. a review of the studies recently published confirmed the recommendations of the us centers for disease control and prevention for severe (inpatients) and mild-to-moderate (outpatients) pelvic inflammatory disease infections. in the case of severe infections, two regimens are recommended: a second-generation cephalosporin like cefoxitin or cefotetan, plus doxycycline or clindamycin/gentamicin. in the case of mild-to-moderate infection, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus doxycycline, or oral clindamycin plus an oral quinolone are recommended. such studies produce high bacteriologic and clinical success rates. new studies indicate that gentamicin may be replaced with a monobactam such as aztreonam; this regimen leads to slightly better efficacy and less toxicity. the possibility of using clindamycin and a quinolone antibiotic is also discussed.

AB == in the present study we determined the resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria  from human saliva and stool specimens and investigated whether there were significant differences in resistance between outpatients and hospitalized patients, regardless of whether they had received antimicrobial agents. no bacterial strains resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, imipenem, clindamycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole were isolated from the saliva samples. however, resistance to ampicillin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime was found in strains from 70% of the fecal samples (mainly bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium innocuum, and bacteroides ovatus). resistance to both ampicillin and cefuroxime was frequently found in 19% of the isolated strains (mainly b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, and bacteroides vulgatus). no strains that were resistant to imipenem, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole were found. hospitalization and/or intake of antimicrobial agents was associated with an increase in the relative number of resistant anaerobic intestinal bacteria. the percentage of resistant anaerobic strains encountered, compared with the total number of anaerobic bacteria in the normal fecal microflora, was between 5.2 and 14.8%, with the lower value associated with the outpatient group. two-thirds of the resistant strains from this group had a relative frequency of less than 1% of the total anaerobic flora, while one-third of the strains were present at a level of greater than 1%; for the hospitalized patients, two-thirds of the strains were present at a level of greater than 1%, and one-third of the strains were present at a level of less than 1% (p < 0.001). patients who had received antimicrobial agents for 6 days or more (n=20) had an average of 1.6 resistant anaerobic strains each, while patients treated for 3 to 5 days (n = 30) had a mean number of 0.87 resistant strains each ( p < 0.05).

AB == bacteroides fragilis when inoculated intragastrically induced abscess formation in the mice of which the intestinal microbial flora had been disturbed by the prior intake of streptomycin and erythromycin in their drinking water. the lesion usually developed at the left axillary lymph node one week after inoculation and persisted for at least two months. without the antibiotic treatment, b. fragilis did not induce such abscess formation. although b. fragilis was isolated from blood after inoculation, intravenous administration of b. fragilis into mice did not induce the abscess formation. therefore, b. fragilis inoculated did not appear to spread from the intestine to the distant locus via the bloodstream. the number of b. fragilis in the mesenteric lymph nodes reached 10(5) colony-forming units per lymph node 6 h after oral administration and remained unchanged over a 24-h period of infection. these results suggest that the lymphatic dissemination of b. fragilis accounts for the abscess formation at the left axillary lymph node.

TI == antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB == the spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from university departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified wilkins-chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the university departments were mainly resistant bacteroides spp., especially bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, peptostreptococcus spp, actinomyces spp. and veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. the study shows that the members of most bacteroides spp. encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.

TI == classification and typing methods of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB == until recently, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes were classified as 'black-pigmented bacteroides'. at present, 11 distinct species are recognized in this group. because of major differences with bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, new genera have been proposed: porphyromonas for three asaccharolytic species, and prevotella for the saccharolytic species. typing methods have been developed for some species of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. these include biotyping and serotyping, but relatively few types can be distinguished with these methods. recently, dna restriction endonuclease analysis has been used for typing of p. gingivalis, pr. intermedia and p. endodontalis strains. great heterogeneity was observed within all three species. this typing method can be useful for epidemiological studies.

AB == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

AB == the purpose of the present study is to produce a model of infections of oral cavity by inducing abscess in the mandibla of new zealand white rabbits as close to the oral cavity infection site as possible in order to determine whether the administered antimicrobial agents will transfer to the localized inflammatory foci. the pus to be collected should be 0.5 to 1.0g or more to permit bioassay and it should be collectable under nearly uniform conditions at all times. new zealand white rabbit was the experimental animal used, in which anesthesia was induced intraperitoneally to expose the mandibula. a hole was made in the mandibula, into which a small cotton pellet inoculated with streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis, whose cell concentrations had been adjusted to 10(8)cfu/ml, was implanted and the opening was carefully closed with sutures tightly. these two species of bacteria had been selected because mixtures of gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated in most cases from the occluded abscess of oral cavity infections. as a result of the above procedure, it was found that one week after production of the infected model animal, the abscess contained adequate volume of, pus for collection and demonstrated viability of the two transplanted species of bacteria. this animal model was considered an ideal model for use in the studies on treatment of infections in the oral cavity by administering antimicrobial agents to determine the extent of drug transfer into the pus and bones where purulent foci are present.

AB == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

AB == experimental intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in mice by intraperitoneal injections of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. the therapeutic efficacy of ciprofloxacin was investigated in this mixed intra-abdominal abscess model and was compared with that of rifampicin. treatment with ciprofloxacin at 0.2 to 20 mg/kg or rifampicin at 20 mg/kg prevented all mice from death, as compared to the 60% mortality rate observed in the vehicle-treated controls. rifampicin concentrations at 10 and 20 mg/kg were effective in preventing abscess formation and eradicated bacterial abscess. ciprofloxacin at all the levels tested neither reduced the incidence of abscess nor eradicated bact. fragilis from abscesses. however, ciprofloxacin at levels of 20, 10, 5, and 1 mg/kg reduced significantly the number of e. coli cells in the abscess. the peak serum level of ciprofloxacin at the oral dose of 20 mg/kg was 0.43 mg/l which was well above the mic values for e. coli but not for bact. fragilis.

TI == response of a 'susceptible' escherichia coli to metronidazole therapy: an investigation using experimental subcutaneous abscesses.
AB == earlier experiments under anaerobic conditions in vitro had indicated that gram-negative facultative anaerobes were susceptible to therapeutically attainable concentrations of metronidazole. this prompted us to study the response of one such strain to metronidazole therapy. mice with 3-day-old subcutaneous abscesses induced by 'susceptible' escherichia coli (accompanied by potentiating agent and obligately anaerobic bacteroides fragilis) were given metronidazole by mouth (250 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly) either as a two- or a four-dose course. this therapy reduced the viable numbers of e. coli/abscess by a mere 0.3 log10 and 0.7 log10, respectively. assays showed that concentrations of metronidazole in abscess-contents compared favourably with those in the earlier in vitro experiments. but measurement of redox potentials in abscesses indicated that the conditions in these (-191 mv vs. ag/agcl) were not nearly as reduced as those in experiments in vitro (-650 mv). this, and the known dependence of metronidazole on low redox potentials for expression of its antimicrobial ability, appears to be the explanation for the poor anticoliform effect in the subcutaneous abscess model. full assessment of the clinical implications of these observations must await the availability of data regarding redox potentials in clinical situations.

TI == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

AB == more than 1000 strains of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, including reference strains, clinical isolates, and members of the normal flora of the mouth, lower gastro-intestinal tract and vagina of healthy human subjects, were studied by conventional bacteriological methods and by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of metabolic products in a series of investigations. a short combined set of tests with particular discriminant value was selected, and a scheme for the identification of the species and subspecies encountered in the diagnostic bacteriological laboratory was based upon our composite results. the tests are: antibiotic-disk resistance tests with neomycin 1000 micrograms, kanamycin 1000 micrograms, penicillin 2 units and rifampicin 15 micrograms per disk; tolerance tests with sodium taurocholate, victoria blue 4r and gentian violet; and tests for pigment production, indole production, aesculin hydrolysis and the fermentation of glucose, lactose, sucrose, rhamnose, trehalose, mannitol and xylose. gram-negative anaerobic bacilli are divided into four groups: (1) the fragilis group with nine species, which include the five subgroups previously classified as subspecies of b. fragilis; (2) the melaninogenicus-oralis group, which includes the three saccharolytic subspecies (ss.) of b. melaninogenicus--ss. melaninogenicus, ss. intermedius and ss. levii--and four non-pigmented species; (3) the asaccharolytic group, which comprises b. asaccharolyticus (formerly b. melaninogenicus ss. asaccharolyticus), b. corrodens and other non-pigmented non-saccharolytic strains, and (4) the fusobacteria.

TI == various lipopolysaccharides reduce adhesion of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB == the interaction of lps from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and lipid a from s. typhimurium with adhesion of human periodontal cells on plastic surfaces has been studied. the results showed that lps and lipid a reduced adhesion already after 5 min at concentrations from 5 to 200 microgram/ml without influencing cell viability. it could be demonstrated that lps and lipid a interact with both the cell and the substratum surface. lipid a from s. typhimurium was more potent than any of the lps used.

TI == the isolation and identification of bacteroides spp. from the normal human gingival flora.
AB == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of subgingival plaque from 20 normal, healthy adults without periodontal disease. a heavy growth of bacteroides and fusobacterium spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were selected for identification by conventional bacteriological methods. results were obtained in these tests with 188 isolates; some strains of the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group would not grow in pure culture on solid media and showed satellitism in mixed culture, and some strains of fusobacteria did not survive repeated subculture. most isolates (68%) belonged to the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group. the commonest species identified in this group were b. oralis (41%), b. melaninogenicus ss. melaninogenicus (26%) and ss. intermedius (17%). b. oralis was isolated from all subjects and at least one strain of b. melaninogenicus was isolated from 18 out of 20 subjects. only eight strains of the b. fragilis group were detected and they probably represented transient carriage. fusobacterium spp. and l. buccalis were isolated from 15 out of 20 subjects and accounted for 21% of the isolates studied, but most could not be identified specifically by the set of tests used. asaccharolytic species of bacteroides were isolated in small numbers from seven subjects.

TI == vein reconstruction of a mycotic internal carotid aneurysm.
AB == carotid aneurysms are an extremely rare entity; mycotic carotid aneurysms are even more uncommon. most articles in the past have advocated ligation as treatment of mycotic carotid aneurysms due to the dangers of graft placement in an infected field. unfortunately, stroke occurs in many patients so treated. as the cerebral complications were so high, bypass using autogenous vein and fine monofilament polypropylene sutures is attractive. this technique was used in a patient having a mycotic carotid aneurysm who was referred to the vascular service of the shands teaching hospital. pre- and postoperative antibiotics, resection of the aneurysm, anastomosis in a noninfected area, and long-term oral antibiotics were felt to be other important aspects of the patient's treatment. this individual is well one year after operation without neurological sequelae. this case suggests that if strict operative and therapeutic guidelines are observed, bypass with autogenous vein is a feasible operative alternative in patients having mycotic carotid aneurysms. the risk of this procedure must be carefully weighed against the devastating neurological sequellae that might result with ligation.

TI == bacteriology of rattlesnake venom and implications for therapy.
AB == although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. in this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. the most common species isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and clostridium species. bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. when the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (p = 0.035). until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.

TI == influence of bowel preparation and antimicrobials on colonic microflora.
AB == the influence of three types of preoperative mechanical bowel preparation on colonic microflora has been studied in 88 patients undergoing elective bowel resection and compared with 21 controls. neither conventional bowel preparation (cbp) using oral magnesium sulphate, enemas and rectal washouts nor whole bowel irrigation (wbi) via a nasogastric tube influenced the type or number of organisms in the colon at the time of operation. the administration of an elemental diet (ed) was associated with only a small reduction the numbers of escherichia coli (p less than 0.02). the addition of oral neomycin and metronidazole for 48 h before operation to all three methods of bowel preparation was associated with a highly significant reduction in the counts per ml of e. coli (p less than 0.001) and bacteroides fragilis (p less than 0.001) in the colon. there was no correlation between the diameter of the lesion being resected with the numbers of bacteria in the colon even when oral neomycin and metronidazole were added to the bowel preparation.

TI == synergistic action of erythromycin and cefamandole against bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis.
AB == erythromycin and cefamandole have exhibited synergistic activity against eight strains of bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis. in concentrations of only 0.25 to 0.5 mug of erythromycin per ml (easily obtainable with oral therapy), less than 0.4 mug (0.015 to 1.0) of cefamandole per ml inhibited the b. fragilis strains. in the presence of the erythromycin, the potency of cefamandole was increased more than 100-fold. on the basis of the mechanism of action of these two antibiotics, the synergism may be related to inhibition of beta-lactamase formation by the erythromycin, removal of the bacterial cell wall by the cefamandole permitting erythromycin penetration to the ribosomal level, and decreasing inoculum effect.

TI == bactericidal activity of tinidazole. an in vitro comparison of the effects of tinidazole and metronidazole against bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB == the new antiprotozoal agent, tinidazole, was found to be bactericidal against all 52 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria tested, 42 bacteroides fragilis, 4 clostridia and 6 peptostreptococci. the minimum bactericidal concentrations of tinidazole for b. fragilis ranged from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, and those of metronidazole from 0.25 to 8 mug/ml, i.e. several times lower than the serum concentrations achievable after oral administration. in most cases the mic was identical with mbc or half of it. on the average, tinidazole was slightly more effective against b. fragilis than metronidazole. although essentially the activities of the two drugs were positively correlated, there was a fourfold difference in their mbc for 10 of the 42 b. fragilis.

TI == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
