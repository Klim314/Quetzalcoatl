TI  == supercritical co2 extraction of functional compounds from spirulina and their biological activity.
AB  == supercritical carbon dioxide (scco2) extraction and fractionation of spirulina platensis was carried out to obtain functional compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities. extraction of scco2 was carried out using 200 g of spirulina powder at 40 masculinec under 120 bar pressure with  co2 flow rate of 1.2 kg h(-1). scco2 fraction obtained was further treated with hexane and ethyl acetate to identify its components. individual components were identified by comparing mass spectra of samples with standard data and retention  indices (ri) of c5-c20 n-alkanes mixture using the kovat index formula. the phenolic and flavonoid content of the scco2 extract was found to be 0.34 +/- 0.01 g/100 g and 0.12 +/- 0.01 g/100 g respectively. the scco2 extract had antioxidant activity with ic50 value of 109.6 +/- 3.0 mug ml(-1) for dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical), ic50 value of 81.66 +/- 2.5 mug ml(-1)  for reducing power and ic50 value of 112.70 +/- 0.8 mug ml(-1) for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. further, antioxidant activity study on oxidative induced dna damage was analysed to elucidate the positive role of scco2 extract.  scco2 extracts showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria  (staphylococcus aureus fri 722 and bacillus cereus f 4810) compared to that of gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli mtcc 108 and yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859). the scco2 extract exhibited inhibitory activity on both angiotensin-1  converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase with ic50 values of 274 +/- 1.0 mug ml(-1) and 307 +/- 2.0 mug ml(-1) respectively.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  == essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. in the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-o-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater  antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. the study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from schiff bases of zein.
AB  == pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. in an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, chemical modification of zein through forming schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. the chemical structure of the schiff bases films were characterized by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. an increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). an increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. as shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. surface topography also varied by forming schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. the antibacterial activities of zein and schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica). it was found that the antibacterial activity of the schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == nitropropenyl benzodioxole, an anti-infective agent with action as a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.
AB  == we report on the activities of a broad spectrum antimicrobial compound,nitropropenyl benzodioxole (npbd) which are of relevance to its potential as an anti-infective drug. these investigations support the proposal that a major mechanism of npbd is action as a tyrosine mimetic, competitively inhibiting bacterial and fungal protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptp). npbd did not affect major anti-bacterial drug targets, namely, atp production, cell wall or cell membrane integrity, or transcription and translation of rna. npbd inhibited  bacterial yoph and human ptp1b and not human cd45 in enzyme assays. npbd inhibited ptp-associated bacterial virulence factors, namely, endospore formation in bacillus cereus, prodigiosin secretion in serratia marcescens , motility in proteus spp., and adherence and invasion of mammalian cells by yersinia enterocolitica . npbd acts intracellularly to inhibit the early development stages of the chlamydia trachomatis infection cycle in mammalian cells known to involve sequestration of host cell ptps. npbd thus both kills pathogens and inhibits virulence factors relevant to early infection, making it a suitable candidate for development as an anti-infective agent, particularly for pathogens  that enter through, or cause infections at, mucosal surfaces. though much is yet  to be understood about bacterial ptps, they are proposed as suitable anti-infective targets and have been linked to agents similar to npbd. the structural and functional diversity and heterogeneous distribution of ptps across microbial species make them suitably selective targets for the development of both broadly active and pathogen-specific drugs.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == toxin production and growth of pathogens subjected to temperature fluctuations simulating consumer handling of cold cuts.
AB  == it is crucial for the quality and safety of ready-to-eat (rte) foods to maintain  the cold chain from production to consumption. the effect of temperature abuse related to daily meals and elevated refrigerator temperatures on the growth and toxin production of bacillus cereus, bacillus weihenstephanensis and staphylococcus aureus and the growth of listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica was studied. a case study with temperature loggings in the domestic environment during easter and christmas holidays was performed to select relevant time and temperature courses. a model for bacterial surface growth on food using nutrient agar plates exposed to variations in temperatures was used to simulate food stored at different temperatures and exposed to room temperature for short periods of time. the results were compared with predicted growth using  the modeling tool combase predictor. the consumers exposed their cold cuts to room temperatures as high as 26.5 degrees c with an average duration of meals was 47 min daily for breakfast/brunch during the vacations. short (</= 2 h) daily intervals at 25 degrees c nearly halved the time the different pathogens needed to reach levels corresponding to the levels associated with human infection or intoxication, compared with the controls continuously stored at refrigerator temperature. although the temperature fluctuations affected growth of both b. weihenstephanensis and s. aureus, toxin production was only detected at much higher cell concentrations than what has been associated with human intoxications. therefore, growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica was found to be the limiting factor for safety. in combination with data on temperature abuse in the domestic environment, modeling programs such as combase  predictor can be efficient tools to predict growth of some pathogens but will not predict toxin production.

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  == most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. the list of targets include, among the others, listeria spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., escherichia coli spp., campylobacter spp., clostridium spp. and staphylococcus aureus. the accuracy of detection was determined by using atcc strains as positive and negative controls. the achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic dna, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. the working ranges of the taqman((r)) real-time pcr assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of listeria spp., listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, salmonella enterica, shigella boydii, e. coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter sakazakii and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. no matrix interferences were observed.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == yaxab, a yersinia enterocolitica pore-forming toxin regulated by rova.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator rova positively regulates transcription of the yersinia enterocolitica virulence gene inv. invasin, encoded by inv, is important for establishment of y. enterocolitica infection. however, a rova mutant is more  attenuated for virulence than an inv mutant, implying that rova regulates additional virulence genes. when the y. enterocolitica rova regulon was defined by microarray analysis, ye1984 and ye1985 were among the genes identified as being upregulated by rova. since these genes are homologous to xenorhabdus nematophila cytotoxin genes xaxa and xaxb, we named them yaxa and yaxb, respectively. in this work, we demonstrate the effects of yaxab on the course of  infection in the murine model. while a yaxab mutant (deltayaxab) is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, it slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing pathology in the spleen. further, we found  that yaxab encode a probable cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that both yaxa and yaxb are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two proteins associate. yaxab-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores. in silico tertiary structural analysis identified predicted structural homology between yaxa and proteins in pore-forming toxin complexes from bacillus cereus (hbl-b) and escherichia coli (hlye). thus, it appears that yaxab function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane. this characterization of yaxab supports the hypothesis that rova regulates expression  of multiple virulence factors in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == pathogenic bacteria in finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  == while the quality of raw cow milk in finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) cfu/ml annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in finnish raw milk is underreported. the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of listeria  monocytogenes, thermophilic campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., stx-positive escherichia coli (stec), coagulase-positive staphylococci, yersinia spp., and bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 finnish farms. additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and e. coli counts. l. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 cfu/ml. thermophilic campylobacter spp. or salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. stec with shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 cfu/ml in the positive samples. members of the b. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 cfu/ml in the positive samples. no relationship was detected between e. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was  mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.

TI  == development of a random genomic dna microarray for the detection and identification of listeria monocytogenes in milk.
AB  == we developed a dna microarray that contains random genomic dna fragments of listeria monocytogenes, validated its diagnostic abilities using cells grown in laboratory media and milk, and established enrichment conditions for detection of a low population of l. monocytogenes in milk. genomic dna of l. monocytogenes strain atcc 19111 was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis after being cleaved using several different pairs of restriction enzymes. sixty dna fragments of different sizes were randomly selected and spotted onto an amine-coated glass  slide. to validate diagnostic ability, probes on the dna microarray were hybridized with genomic dna extracted from l. monocytogenes, other listeria spp., and foodborne pathogenic bacteria belonging to other genera grown in laboratory media. the dna microarray showed 98-100% positive hybridization signals for the 16 strains of l. monocytogenes tested, 7-85% positive signals for 9 strains of other listeria spp., and 0-32% positive signals for 13 strains of other types of  foodborne pathogens. in milk, the detection limit of the dna microarray was approximately 8 log cfu/ml. when milk contained l. monocytogenes (3-4 log cfu/ml) with other types of bacteria (bacillus spp., b. cereus, salmonella montevideo, peudomonas aeruginosa, and yersinia enterocolitica; ca. 3 log cfu/ml each), l. monocytogenes enriched in uvm modified listeria enrichment broth at 37 degrees c  for 24h was successfully detected by the dna microarray. results indicate that the dna microarray can detect l. monocytogenes and distinguish it from other listeria spp. and other foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and milk. this platform will be useful when developing a dna microarray to rapidly and simultaneously detect and identify various foodborne pathogens in foods.

TI  == changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. a total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. no significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (p>0.05) with the exception of bacillus cereus. the contaminant percentage of b. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, p<0.05). b. cereus and listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. on  the other hand, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples.  however, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.

TI  == prevalence of foodborne pathogens in retailed foods in thailand.
AB  == the consumption of foodborne pathogens contaminated in food is one of the major causes of diarrheal diseases in thailand. the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and types of contaminating bacteria in retailed foodstuffs in thailand. food from four categories (137 samples total), including  meat (51 samples), vegetables (38 samples), fish or seafood (37 samples), and fermented food (11 samples), was purchased randomly from seven different open-markets and seven supermarkets in thailand from august 2010 to march 2011. seven types of major foodborne pathogens were identified using conventional culture methods. approximately 80% of meat samples tested was contaminated with salmonella spp. in contrast, the salmonella spp. contamination rate of vegetable  (5%) or fermented food (9%) samples was comparatively low. six strains of cronobacter sakazakii and two strains of yersinia enterocolitica were also isolated. a substantially higher rate of contamination by bacillus cereus was observed in fermented food (82%) than in samples of meat (2%) and fish or seafood (5%). seven listeria spp. isolates were obtained from meat and fish or seafood samples. approximately 39% of samples tested were found to be contaminated with staphylococcus spp. (54 isolates). the rate of bacterial contamination of meat did not depend on the type of market. however, the contamination rate of staphylococcus spp. in vegetables was higher in open markets than in supermarkets, and the contamination rate of salmonella spp. and staphylococcus spp. in fish or seafood samples purchased in open markets was likewise higher than in those purchased in supermarkets. therefore, improvement of hygienic practices throughout the food chain may be required to reduce the risk of food poisoning.

AB  == in this study, two schiff base ligands (hl(1) and hl(2)) and their cu(ii), co(ii), ni(ii), pd(ii) and ru(iii) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. the ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus brevis, bacillus megaterium, bacillus cereus, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella fragilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). the antioxidant properties of the schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) free radical  scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == study on the antibiotic activity of microcapsule curcumin against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. the microcapsule  curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as escherichia coli, yersinia  enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, aspergillus niger, penicllium notatum, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. it exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/ml. for the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better  than antibacterial activity. microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == inactivation of foodborne pathogens using a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (oaugdp) for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and to evaluate the influence of growth temperature, ph, and culture age on their inactivation. escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica, and shigella flexneri were evaluated. three-strain mixtures of each bacterium were inoculated (6-7 log cfu/cm(2)) onto microscope slides containing nonselective agar media adjusted to ph 5 or 7. samples were exposed to plasma for 0-240 sec immediately, or after incubation for 24 h at 10 degrees c or 35 degrees c. after exposure, the agar was removed from the slides and pummeled in 0.1% peptone water with a stomacher, serially diluted, surface plated onto nonselective media, and incubated at 35 degrees c. exposure time, ph, incubation temperature, and culture age affected survival of all pathogens exposed to plasma (p < 0.05). the greatest reduction of pathogens generally occurred during the initial exposure time of 30 or 90 sec. pathogens incubated for 24 h before exposure were more resistant than those exposed immediately after inoculation. incubation at 35 degrees c before exposure resulted in greater resistance to plasma inactivation than incubation at 10 degrees c. no appreciable differences between gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were observed, although the spore-forming b. cereus was more resistant to plasma than non-spore-formers. these findings support the potential for plasma treatment of foods or surfaces for pathogen reduction. increased sensitivity of pathogens to plasma at reduced ph and temperature is encouraging, since these conditions are applicable to many foods during processing, handling, and storage.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic diversity of lactococcus lactis isolates from batzos, a  greek pdo raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

TI  == identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  == identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (fames) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of fame profiles using commercial midi databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. fast gc (5 min) fame procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation  have also been reported. in this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of fame mixtures was demonstrated. the microorganisms investigated included gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and bacillus cereus, and gram negative bacteria from the family enterobacteriacae: yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, and escherichia coli (four strains of e. coli), and non-enterobacteriacae: vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, and vibrio  parahemolyticus. foodborne bacterial mixtures of fames were measured by using an  attenuated total reflection (atr)-fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. results showed that the enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. the identification was at the level of species (for the bacillus and vibrio genera) or strains (for the  e. coli species). a series of bacterial fame test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.

TI  == duplex real-time sybr green pcr assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  == a duplex real-time sybr green lightcycler pcr (lc-pcr) assay with dna extraction  using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or  less. the protocol used the same lc-pcr with 20 pairs of specific primers. the products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (t(m)) curve analysis. the 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus, aeromonas spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and bacillus cereus. no interference with the lc-pcr assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. the detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of  stool. the protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. however, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == screening of bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  == as probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they  are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. in this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. all strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) test in order to confirm their classification within the  genus bifidobacterium. selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic  activities against escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, staphylococcus lentus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes. experiments were performed in vitro by different methods  based on the observation of growth inhibition in petri dishes. the strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by sds-page for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the biolog system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical  evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.

TI  == structural model requirements to describe microbial inactivation during a mild heat treatment.
AB  == the classical concept of d and z values, established for sterilisation processes, is unable to deal with the typical non-loglinear behaviour of survivor curves occurring during the mild heat treatment of sous vide or cook-chill food products. structural model requirements are formulated, eliminating immediately some candidate model types. promising modelling approaches are thoroughly analysed and, if applicable, adapted to the specific needs: two models developed  by casolari (1988), the inactivation model of sapru et al. (1992), the model of whiting (1993), the baranyi and roberts growth model (1994), the model of chiruta et al. (1997), the model of daughtry et al. (1997) and the model of xiong et al.  (1999). a range of experimental data of bacillus cereus, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and lactobacillus sake are used  to illustrate the different models' performances. moreover, a novel modelling approach is developed, fulfilling all formulated structural model requirements, and based on a careful analysis of literature knowledge of the shoulder and tailing phenomenon. although a thorough insight in the occurrence of shoulders and tails is still lacking from a biochemical point of view, this newly developed model incorporates the possibility of a straightforward interpretation within this framework.

TI  == effect of l-glucose and d-tagatose on bacterial growth in media and a cooked cured ham product.
AB  == cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. this spoilage is generally evident from a  milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because  they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. unfortunately, the  meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. an alternative approach from these chemical compounds would  be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. l-glucose and d-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of d-glucose. results showed that both l-glucose and d-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at  all by pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a separate study, d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing d-tagatose than those containing l- or d-glucose. levels of enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (p < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the  meat formulations. compared to the control sample containing d-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing d-tagatose at 10 degrees c was extended by 7 to 10 days. these results indicate that d-tagatose could deter the  growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.

AB  == the influence of low (0.39-1.1%), medium (4.25%) and high (7.1-32.5%) fat levels  in fish on radiation inactivation of four food-borne pathogens was investigated.  cells of listeria monocytogenes 036, yersinia enterocolitica f5692, bacillus cereus and salmonella typhimurium at logarithmic phase were inoculated in 10% fish homogenates and subjected to gamma irradiation at ice temperature (0-1 degree c) with doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 kgy. the radiation survival curves  of l. monocytogenes and b. cereus were characterized by shoulders, while a tailing effect was depicted by cells of y. enterocolitica and b. cereus. the d10  values in kgy calculated on the exponential part of the curve ranged from 0.2 to  0.3, 0.15 to 0.25, 0.1 to 0.15 and 0.09 to 0.1 for l. monocytogenes 036, b. cereus, salm. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica f5692, respectively. this order (d10) of radiation resistance of each organism was not affected by the fat content of the fish. inoculated pack studies carried out separately with each pathogen in fatty (indian sardine, 7.1%) and lean (golden anchovy, 0.39%) fish showed no difference in their survival after exposure to 1 kgy and 3 kgy doses, which corroborated the above observation. the practical significance of these results in the application of the technology is discussed.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  == faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (sids) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. serum samples from the sids infants were also analysed for these toxins. a significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of sids babies than in samples from the comparative group. these toxins were also found in serum from the sids babies. clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 sids cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); c. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 sids cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 sids cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies  (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); c. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 sids cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and bacillus cereus were not detected. heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (hlml) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 sids faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 sids serum samples. c. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 sids serum samples. c. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%)  of 87 sids serum samples. c. difficile toxin was detected in four sids faecal samples and two serum samples. c. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 sids faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. staphylococcal  enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 sids  serum samples.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea among united states military personnel during joint american-egyptian armed forces exercises in cairo, egypt.
AB  == a study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a united states military population on deployment in cairo, egypt, during july and august 1987. acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. a possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (17% st-producers, 13% lt-producers, and 3% lt/st-producers); shigella (9%); campylobacter spp. (2%); salmonella (2%); and vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included aeromonas hydrophila group, plesiomonas shigelloides, and bacillus cereus. yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive e. coli, intoxications by clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not  found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. a survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel deployed to egypt.

TI  == rapid methods for differentiating gram-positive from gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == different tests based on lysis by koh and on reaction with fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, l-alanine-4-nitroanilide (lana); l-alanine-4-methoxy- beta-naphthylamide (mna); 4-alanine-2-amidoacridone (aaa); l-alanine-7-amido- 4-methylcoumarin (aamc); 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ans) were compared for their suitability to distinguish gram-positive from gram-negative bacteria. a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was chosen for incorporating lana, aaa, aamc and ans into the growth medium, based on sensitivity tests. mna did not show any detectable reaction over a concentration range from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, and led to inhibition of all bacteria at 200 micrograms/ml. in the examination of a total of 146 bacterial strains, including yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, and b. subtilis the koh test was not comparable  with the gram staining. a good correlation with gram staining was found between lana, aaa and aamc added to plate count agar on one hand, and lana and aamc impregnated paper strips on the other hand, thereby utilizing the aminopeptidase  activity. agar containing ans showed detectable fluorescence with all gram-negative strains, but with staphylococcus aureus and staph. epidermidis a weak reaction was also observed. aamc was selected for a rapid paper strip test.  with this substrate a pronounced blue fluorescence was obtained with gram-negative colonies.

TI  == survival and growth of food poisoning bacteria following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties.
AB  == following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties with and without sorbic acid, obtained directly from the manufacturer, strains of enteropathogenic escherichia  coli and other e. coli survived but failed to multiply during storage at 7, 10 or 25 degrees c. in the absence of sorbic acid spoilage due to pseudomonas fluorescens occurred after storage for 5-13 days at 7 or 10 degrees c and 1-2 days at 25 degrees c. salmonella enteritidis, s. hadar, s. saint-paul, s. typhimurium and s. virchow survived but failed to multiply at 10 degrees c and, in the case of most strains, at 20 or 25 degrees c. s. typhimurium multiplied 100-fold in one batch of cottage cheese with peppers and onion in the absence of  sorbic acid during storage at 25 degrees c for 2 days; spoilage of this batch occurred due to yeasts or yeasts and moulds after storage for 4-8 days at 10 degrees c and 0-2 days at 20 or 25 degrees c. following inoculation into cottage  cheese varieties, prepared in the laboratory and which did not contain sorbic acid, as contaminants of the added protein or vegetable ingredients the numbers of staphylococcus aureus declined during storage at 10 and 20 degrees c, the numbers of bacillus cereus and s. typhimurium increased at both temperatures, and the numbers of yersinia enterocolitica increased at 10 degrees c, but declined at 20 degrees c. spoilage occurred due to the growth of moulds and p. fluorescens after storage for 5-14 days at 10 degrees c, and due to p. fluorescens after storage for up to 2 days at 20 degrees c. in products inoculated in a similar way but which contained sorbic acid (500-530 mg/kg), the numbers of s. aureus and b.  cereus declined and in most products the numbers of s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica remained constant. in cottage cheese with chicken, however, the numbers of y. enterocolitica increased 100-fold during storage of the product for 14 days at 10 degrees and the numbers of s. typhimurium increased 100-fold during storage for 2 days at 20 degrees c. spoilage of this product due to p. fluorescens occurred after storage for 8-14 days at 10 degrees c, but was not evident at 20 degrees c after 2 days.

TI  == antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system on food-poisoning organisms.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system was studied on food-poisoning organisms including staphylococcus aureus, salmonella infantis, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica using automated turbidometry. the bacteria were grown in sterile-filtered meat medium which was either raw or heat-denaturated. the results showed a clear growth inhibition with combinations  of 0.5-1.0 mg/ml glucose and 0.5-1.0 iu/ml glucose oxidase. the growth inhibition was more effective in the heat-denaturated meat medium. the most resistant pathogens were campylobacter jejuni and listeria monocytogenes, however growth inhibition was still evident. the possible application of the glucose oxidase-glucose system in food products inhibiting the growth of pathogens and spoilage organisms is discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.

TI  == microbiological aspects of goat's milk. a public health laboratory service survey.
AB  == in a 12-month survey (june 1982-may 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. the statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees c and by  76% at 22 degrees c. there were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 escherichia coli per ml in 91%. staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. the methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. no sample was brucella ring-test-positive. experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored  goat's milk showed that bacillus cereus, staph. aureus, salmonella typhimurium and y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees c. clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while campylobacter jejuni did not grow. the results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

AB  == a total of 69 dyes were incorporated separately at different concentrations into  an agar medium for evaluation of their effects on the quantitative recovery of five serotypes of yersinia enterocolitica. one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of bacillus cereus were included for comparative purposes. certain dyes were evaluated further for their selective properties with five additional serotypes of y. enterocolitica, three strains of p. aeruginosa, and two of engerobacter spp. metanil yellow was the only dye which was tolerated bettr by y. enterocolitica than by p. aeruginosa. dye sensitivity was variable amond strains  of the same serotype of y. enterocolitica. in general, y. enterocolitica showed a tolerance to dyes greater than that of gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria.
