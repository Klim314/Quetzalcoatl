TI  == optimization of matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the identification of bacterial contaminants in beverages.
AB  == the growth of microbial contaminants in industrially produced beverages can cause turbidity, haze and off-flavors resulting in quality loss often rendering the product undrinkable. in this work matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) based on the generation of peptide mass fingerprints, which form a distinctive protein peak pattern, is presented as a rapid, reliable and powerful  tool for the identification of spoilage bacteria encountered in beverages. lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus claussenii and leuconostoc mesenteroides were used to optimize sample preparation and maldi-tof ms-settings. different sample preparation methods ranging from plain cell smears to more elaborate extraction procedures including mechanical and enzymatical disruption of cells were investigated. the effects of culturing time and the availability of oxygen and nutrients on the acquired protein peak patterns were studied. while cell smears at times hampered the acquisition of spectra for strain l. brevis all other procedures constantly delivered good quality spectra for all three strains. the extraction procedure allowed good reproducibility of spectra with high information content and enabled differentiation on the species level regardless of the culture conditions used. the application of specific culture conditions to microorganisms resulted in minor but stable changes in spectra, which were not sufficient to impair identification of isolates on the species level.

TI  == rt-qpcr analysis of putative beer-spoilage gene expression during growth of lactobacillus brevis bso 464 and pediococcus claussenii atcc baa-344(t) in beer.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) contamination of beer presents a continual economic threat to brewers. interestingly, only certain isolates of lab can grow in the hostile beer environment (e.g., as studied here, lactobacillus brevis bso 464 (lb464) and a non-ropy isolate of pediococcus claussenii atcc baa-344(t) (pc344nr)), indicating that significant genetic specialization is required. the genes hita, hora, horb, horc, and bsra, which have been proposed to confer beer-spoiling ability to an organism, are suspected of counteracting the antimicrobial effects of hops. however, these genes are not present in the same combination (if at all) across beer-spoiling organisms. as such, we sought to investigate the extent to which these genes participate during lb464 and pc344nr  mid-logarithmic growth in beer through reverse transcription quantitative pcr analysis. we first determined the optimal reference gene set needed for data normalization and, for each bacterium, established that two genes were needed for accurate assessment of gene expression. following this, we found that hora expression was induced for pc344nr, but not for lb464, during growth in beer. instead, horc expression was dramatically increased in lb464 when growing in beer, whereas no change was detected for the other putative beer-spoilage-related genes. this indicates that horc may be one of the principle mediators enabling growth of lb464 in beer, whereas in pc344nr, this may be attributable to hora. these findings not only reveal that lb464 and pc344nr are unique in their beer-specific genetic expression profile but also indicate that a range of genetic specialization exists among beer-spoilage bacteria.
