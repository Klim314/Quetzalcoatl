TI  == analysis of microflora profile in korean traditional nuruk.
AB  == a variety of nuruk were collected from various provinces in korea, and their microflora profiles were analyzed at the species level. a total of 42 nuruk samples were collected and when the viable cell numbers in these nuruk were enumerated, the average cell numbers of bacteria, fungi, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria from all nuruk were 7.21, 7.91, 3.49, and 4.88 log cfu/10 g, respectively. there were no significant differences in viable cell numbers of bacteria or fungi according to regions collected. bacillus amyloliquefaciens and  b. subtilis were the predominant bacterial strains in most samples. a significant portion, 13 out of 42 nuruk, contained foodborne pathogens such as b. cereus or cronobacter sakazakii. there were various species of lactic acid bacteria such as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus in nuruk. it was unexpectedly found that only 13 among the 42 nuruk samples contained aspergillus oryzae, the representative saccharifying fungi in makgeolli, whereas a fungi lichtheimia corymbifera was widely distributed in nuruk. it was also found that pichia jadinii was the predominant yeast strain in most nuruk, but the representative alcohol fermentation strain, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was isolated from only 18  out of the 42 nuruk. these results suggested that a variety of species of fungi and yeast were distributed in nuruk and involved in the fermentation of makgeolli. in this study, a total of 64 bacterial species, 39 fugal species, and  15 yeast species were identified from nuruk. among these strains, 37 bacterial species, 20 fungal species, and 8 yeast species were distributed less than 0.1%.

TI  == characterization of anti-listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  == this work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. the two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing,  as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. growth of listeria innocua, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and other lab species were inhibited, although no inhibition of gram-negative microorganisms was observed. proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the  inhibitors. the antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with nacl,  sds, triton x-100, tween 20, tween 80 and edta after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of ph and temperatures. production of bacteriocin by e. faecium (bacalp7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 au/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by p. pentosaceus alp57 (bacalp57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 au/ml. the bacteriocins did not kill l. monocytogenes esb54 nor l. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. the partially purified bacteriocins, bacalp7 and bacalp57, were below 6.5 kda in size as determined by tricine-sds gel electrophoresis. e. faecium and p. pentosaceus contained dna fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin b and pediocin pa-1, respectively. sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. to our knowledge, for the first time two lab producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin pa-1 and enterocin b, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. the adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of l. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.

TI  == glucan and fructan production by sourdough weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == after a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (eps)-forming strains of weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. after 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, the synthesis of eps in mrs-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg ml-1. eps  had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 da. as shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of eps was found from sucrose only. two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kda were in  situ detected on sds-page gels incubated with sucrose. pcr products of ca. 220 bp were found for l. plantarum pl9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of l. plantarum wcfs1) and w. cibaria wc4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsd, of bacillus cereus g9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. degenerated primers dexreur and dexreuv showed a unique pcr product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for w. cibaria wc4 and l. plantarum pl9. the sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum  lp9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 eps during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. compared to the sourdough started with an eps-negative strain, the sourdough started with w. cibaria wc4 or l. plantarum lp9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. the synthesis of eps by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == bacteriocins from pediococcus pentosaceus l and s from pork meat.
AB  == two strains of pediococcus pentosaceus were isolated from refrigerated pork and found to produce antimicrobial substances that may inhibit foodborne pathogens and have potential as natural food preservatives. they were named p. pentosaceus  l and s. the antimicrobial substances were purified to electrophoretical homogeneity by chloroform extraction and designated pentocins l and s with molecular masses (m) of 27 and 25 kda, respectively. both pentocins also had broad inhibition spectra and were thermostable. they inhibit the growth of tested spore-forming g+ and g- strains and the germination of bacillus subtilis atcc 10225, b. subtilis atcc 10254, and bacillus cereus atcc 11778 spores. the inhibition activities decreased as the glucose in the medium decreased from 8.0 to 2.0%.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
