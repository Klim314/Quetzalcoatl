TI  == in vitro potency of doripenem tested against an international collection of rarely isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == doripenem, a new 1beta-methyl parenteral carbapenem, has very broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria. as noted here, the spectrum and potency extended to many rarely isolated species sampled by the  doripenem global surveillance program. among the species or species groups with <or=0.14% prevalence (1959 strains tested), doripenem was active against 98.9% of enterobacteriaceae at <or=0.5 microg/ml. similarly, more than 90% of other rarely isolated gram-negative species isolates (aeromonas spp., delftia acidovorans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, neisseria meningitidis, ochrobactrum anthropi, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, and pseudomonas stutzeri) were  inhibited by <or=2 microg/ml of doripenem. the low-prevalence gram-positive pathogens were generally less doripenem susceptible with mic(90) results at >0.25 microg/ml for all tested species except lactococcus garvieae, listeria monocytogenes, and micrococcus spp. in conclusion, doripenem exhibited a very wide spectrum but variable potencies against uncommonly cultured aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated in 2003 to 2007. these results confirm the potential use of this new carbapenem for broad-spectrum empiric or directed antimicrobial therapy.
