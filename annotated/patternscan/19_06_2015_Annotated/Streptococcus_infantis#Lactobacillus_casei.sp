TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  == to survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active lactobacillus. we incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of api50 ch test kit and rapid id 32a kit. strains of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei were collected. by agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to brucella blood agar-mic plates. each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin g, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. after incubation, the growth condition of each brucella blood agar-mic plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different lactobacillus products determined. the mics of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-g to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for l. casei were >32 microg/ml. l. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. according to the mics of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
