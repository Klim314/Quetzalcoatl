TI  == sensitive, resistant and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumanii at saudi arabia hospital eastern region.
AB  == since the physicians start use of antibiotics long ago with un-notice drug resistance. however actual problem was recognized about 85 years ago. antibiotic  resistant and multi-drug resistant bacterial strains are at rise throughout the world. it is physicians and researchers to take scientific research based appropriate action to overcome this ever-spreading problem. this study is designed to find out sensitive (s), resistant (r) and multi-drug resistant (mdr)  acinetobacter baumanii strain along with other isolates in the resident patients  of eastern region of saudi arabia. pseudomonas aeruginosa is excluded from other  gram-negative organisms isolated from different sites as it will be dealt separately. this study is based in was retrospective observations designed to collect data of different stains of acinetobacter baumanii with reference to their sensitivity (s), resistance (r), multi-drug resistance (mdr) along with other gram negative isolated from different sites (from 1st january 2004 to 31st  december 2011) at king abdulaziz hospital located eastern region of kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa). all necessary techniques were used to culture and perform sensitivity of these isolates. there were 4532 isolates out of which 3018 (67%) were from patients. out of acinetobacter baumanii infected were 906 (20%) while other 3626 (80%) isolates were miscellaneous. numbers of patients or cases were 480 (53%) out of 906 isolates and numbers of patients or cases in other organisms were 2538 (70%) out of 3626 isolates. acinetobacter baumanii infected patients 221 (46%) were male and 259 (54%) were female and the male and female ratio of 1:1.2. in other organisms this male female ratio was almost same. there was steady rise in number of patients and the hence the isolates from 2004 to 2011. majority of the bacterial strains were isolated as single organism but some were  isolated as double or triple or quadruple or more organisms from different sites. sensitive, resistant and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumanii have been isolated from different sites. the other gram negative isolates included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. a significant rise in r and mdr but there is rise in r and mdr acinetobacter baumanii strains has been interceded other isolates. it is important to adopt proper and sustainable policies and guideline regarding antibiotics prescription and used. we should also check our infection control practices in our hospital or healthcare settings. we should start antibiotics stewardship in our hospital in order to reducing or overcoming antibiotics resistant (r) and multi-drug resistant (mdr) strains prevalence.

TI  == modulation of mgrb gene expression as a source of colistin resistance in klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == gene modifications in the pmrab and phopq two-component regulatory systems, as well as inactivation of the mgrb gene, are known to be causes of colistin resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae. the objective of this study was to characterise the mechanism involved in colistin resistance in a klebsiella oxytoca isolate. a k. oxytoca clinical isolate showing resistance to colistin was recovered in cali, colombia. the pmra, pmrb, phop, phoq and mgrb genes were amplified and sequenced. wild-type mgrb genes from k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca were cloned, and corresponding recombinant plasmids were used for complementation assays. by analysing the mgrb gene of the k. oxytoca isolate and its flanking sequences, an insertion sequence (is) of 1196bp was identified in its promoter region. the insertion was located between nucleotides -39 and -38 when referring  to the start codon of the mgrb gene, thus negatively interfering with expression  of the mgrb gene by modifying its promoter structure. this is was very similar to iskpn26 (99% nucleotide identity) belonging to the is5 family. complementation assays with mgrb genes from wild-type k. pneumoniae or k. oxytoca restored full susceptibility to colistin. in conclusion, here we identified the mechanism involved in colistin resistance in a k. oxytoca isolate. modulation of mgrb gene  expression was the key factor for this acquired resistance to colistin.

TI  == carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  == aims: we compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (ltc). methods: eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were esbl producers. esbl phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and esbl genes were identified by sequencing. esbl producers were characterized by co-resistance and  integron carriage. results: esbl producers were more frequent in the ltc applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 escherichia coli, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 1 proteus mirabilis being found. in the employment screening individuals, only e. coli was found. most esbl genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blactx-m type; blactx-m-15 was more frequent in the ltc applicants (p < 0.001). regarding esbl genes and integron diversity, e. coli isolates from the ltc applicants were more  similar to k. pneumoniae than to e. coli from the employment screening individuals. conclusion: these differences in the characteristics of esbl producers may represent different sources of colonization. most ltc applicants harboured k. pneumoniae or e. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the e. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental e. coli.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils of cultivated oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == background: oregano (origanum vulgare), sage (salvia officinalis), and thyme (thymus vulgaris) are aromatic plants with ornamental, culinary, and phytotherapeutic use all over the world. in europe, they are traditionally used in the southern countries, particularly in the mediterranean region. the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils (eos) derived from those plants have captured the attention of scientists as they could be used as alternatives to the increasing resistance of traditional antibiotics against pathogen infections. therefore, significant interest in the cultivation of various aromatic and medicinal plants is recorded during the last years. however, to gain a proper and marketable chemotype various factors during the cultivation should be considered as the geographical morphology, climatic, and farming conditions. in this frame, we have studied the antimicrobial efficiency of the eos from oregano, sage, and thyme cultivated under different conditions in a region of ne  greece in comparison to the data available in literature. methods: plants were purchased from a certified supplier, planted, and cultivated in an experimental field under different conditions and harvested after 9 months. eos were extracted by using a clevenger apparatus and tested for their antibacterial properties (minimum inhibitory concentration - mic) against clinical isolates of multidrug resistant escherichia coli (n=27), klebsiella oxytoca (n=7), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=16) strains by using the broth microdilution assay. results: our results showed that the most sensitive organism was k. oxytoca with a mean value  of mic of 0.9 microg/ml for oregano eos and 8.1 microg/ml for thyme. the second most sensitive strain was k. pneumoniae with mean mic values of 9.5 microg/ml for thyme and 73.5 microg/ml for oregano eos. e. coli strains were among the most resistant to eos antimicrobial action as the observed mics were 24.8-28.6 microg/ml for thyme and above 125 microg/ml for thyme and sage. most efficient were the eos from thyme followed by those of oregano. conclusions: with mic values above 150 microg/ml, sage eos did not show any antibacterial efficiency against the majority of the strains. however, no significant differences were observed concerning the antimicrobial action of all eos originating from irrigated versus non-irrigated cultivated aromatic plants.

TI  == removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. the antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the presence of copper sulfate (cuso4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic e. coli. in addition, preformed biofilms of e. coli c, salmonella typhimurium, k. pneumoniae, and salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/l naclo, 0.1 mmol/l cuso4, and 350 mmol/l h2o2 for 5 min. klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in naclo concentration, and the e. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. the application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == detection of metallo-beta-lactamase genes in clinically isolated klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == we detected and characterized metallo-beta-lactamase genes (blaimp-1 and blaimp-11) in third generation cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and  klebsiella oxytoca isolated at showa university hospital between january 1, 2011  and december 31, 2012. the cephalosporin-resistant k pneumoniae strains were frequently isolated from the urine, while one strain of k. pneumoniae, which was  resistant to carbapenem, was isolated from the stool. we analyzed the phenotypes  and genotypes of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes from the 16 strains of cephalosporin-resistant-k pneumoniae and 6 strains of -k. oxytoca isolated from the same ward. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were below 4 microg/ml in 21 out of the 22 isolated strains. the double disc synergy test using ceftazidime and sodium mercaptoacetic acid revealed enlargements in the inhibitory zones of 14 of the 16 strains of k. pneumoniae and all 6 strains of k. oxytoca. metallo-beta-lactamase genes were detected in all of the tested strains, with blaimp-1 in 3 k. pneumoniae and 1 k. oxytoca, blaimp-11 in 13 k pneumoniae and 4 k. oxytoca, and both blaimp-1 and blaimp-11 in one k. oxytoca. our results  indicate that third generation cephalosporin-resistant and imipenem-susceptible k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca possess the metallo-beta-lactamase gene. the active  surveillance of metallo-beta-lactamase genes should be performed in clinical laboratories.

TI  == mechanism of resistance and antibacterial susceptibility in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolated between 2000 and 2010 in japan.
AB  == clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca collected from  20 japanese medical facilities between 2000 and 2010 were analysed to evaluate the mechanisms of resistance and antibacterial susceptibilities to 14 antimicrobials. overall, eight of 484 (1.6 %) k. pneumoniae and 19 of 359 (5.3 %) k. oxytoca were determined to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates, and the identified esbls amongst the k. pneumoniae isolates were ctx-m-2, -3, -14 and -15, and shv-12. in contrast, overproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase oxy-2, which was due to a distinct mutation at the - 10 promoter region of this gene, conferred the esbl phenotype to all the k. oxytoca isolates except one. based on the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoints, all the esbl phenotype k. pneumoniae were susceptible to doripenem, flomoxef, moxalactam (latamoxef), cefmetazole and tazobactam/piperacillin, whereas the esbl phenotype k. oxytoca were susceptible to ceftazidime and ceftibuten in addition to the above, with the exception of tazobactam/piperacillin. amongst the oral antimicrobials, ceftibuten was relatively effective against both esbl phenotype klebsiella species compared with levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

TI  == spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. resistance  to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in uti. a hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from april 2011 to september 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting kist hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of uti among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with chronic kidney disease. incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), coagulase negative staphylococcus aureus (cons) (5.88%), enterococcus spp (3.92%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and proteus vulgaris (1.00%). multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.

TI  == carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae in taiwan.
AB  == a total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolates were recovered between november 2010 and july 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in taiwan. carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 kpc-2 (16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 escherichia coli), 1 ndm-1 (k. oxytoca), 37 imp-8 (26 enterobacter cloacae, 4 citrobacter freundii, 4 raoultella planticola, 1 k. pneumoniae, 1 e. coli and 1 k. oxytoca), and 2 vim-1 (1 e. cloacae, 1 e. coli). the kpc-2-positive k. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were st11. imp-8 positive e. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in pfge pattern than those from different hospitals. a total of 518 cre isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaesbl, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaampc-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried  both blaesbl and blaampc. ctx-m (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaesbl, while dha (497, 70.6%) and cmy (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaampc. co-carriage of blaesbl and blaampc was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 cpe, respectively. kpc-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in k. pneumoniae (2.8%), while imp-8 was the most common in e. cloacae (9.7%). all kpc-2-positive  cre were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. however, fourteen of the 37 imp-8-positive cre were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. intra- and inter-hospital spread of kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae and imp-8-producing e. cloacae likely occurred. although the prevalence of cpe is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for cre in areas where imp type carbapenemase is prevalent.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment in urinary tract infections caused by  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are increasing problems. the involvement of esbl-producing organisms is associated with higher rates of carbapenem usage in urinary tract infections (utis). though some strains are susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) in vitro, there is very less data about the consequences of amc usage for such infections. objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological outcomes of amc treatment in utis caused by amc-susceptible esbl-producing organisms. patients and methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. forty-six out of 652 patients (f/m ratio: 32/14; mean age: 43.9 years) with esbl-positive utis were eligible for this study. these patients had cystitis (n = 23), vesicoureteral reflux (n = 7), hyperactive bladder (n = 6), and prostatitis (n = 10). data was collected via chart review and was statistically analyzed. results: amc-susceptible esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca were identified as the causative agents in 31, 14, and 1 patients, respectively. thirty-nine (84.7%) out of 46 patients were successfully treated with oral amc. additionally, 2 (4.3%) patients' urine cultures turned to be negative, though their clinical complaints and leukocyturia had continued. in the remaining 5 (10.8%) patients, no positive clinical and microbiological response was obtained. increased minimum inhibitory concentration levels of amc (from 4 to > 256 microg/ml) were detected in these patients and the treatment failures were attributed to this developing resistance. we found that therapeutic failure was significantly more frequent in klebsiella spp. than in e. coli (33.3% vs 6.5%, p = 0.029). furthermore, no treatment failure was observed in pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 2 mg/ml, and the high amc mic (8 mg/ml) was associated with resistance development and therapeutic failure (71.4% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.0001). conclusions: our results suggested that amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may be a good oral antimicrobial which can be used for treatment of esbl-positive utis, if the causative agent is susceptible to this antibiotic. however, some strains may develop resistance during therapy, especially in those exhibiting high amc mics.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == first description of kpc-2-producing klebsiella oxytoca isolated from a pediatric patient with nosocomial pneumonia in venezuela.
AB  == during the last decade, carbapenem resistance has emerged among clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae family. this has been increasingly attributed to the production of beta-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing carbapenems. among these enzymes, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) are the most frequently and  clinically significant class-a carbapenemases. in this report, we describe the first nosocomial kpc-2-producing k. oxytoca isolated from a pediatric patient with pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit at the andes university hospital, merida, venezuela. this strain was resistant to several antibiotics including imipenem, ertapenem, and meropenem but remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin, colistin, and tigecycline. conjugation assays demonstrated the transferability of all resistance determinants, except aminoglycosides. the isolate lmm-sa26 carried a ~21 kb conjugative plasmid that harbored the bla kpc-2, bla ctx-m-8, and bla tem-15 genes. although carbapenem resistance in the enterobacteriaceae is still unusual in venezuela, kpcs have a great potential to  spread due to their localization on mobile genetic elements. therefore, rapid detection of kpc-carrying bacteria with phenotypic and confirmatory molecular tests is essential to establish therapeutic options and effective control measures.

TI  == worldwide emergence of colistin resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae from healthy  humans and patients in lao pdr, thailand, israel, nigeria and france owing to inactivation of the phop/phoq regulator mgrb: an epidemiological and molecular study.
AB  == the emergence of colistin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp) is a major public health concern worldwide. in this study, the prevalence and molecular basis of colistin resistance in crkp isolated from healthy individuals and patients in lao pdr, thailand, nigeria and france were investigated. stool samples were screened by culture for the presence of colistin-resistant klebsiella spp. whole-genome sequence analysis was used to decipher the molecular mechanism of colistin resistance in a blandm-1-positive in vitro-selected crkp mutant. pcr amplification and sequencing of the mgrb genetic environment was performed for all crkp isolates as well as control colistin-susceptible k. pneumoniae (cskp) isolates recovered from the same stools. a total of 869 stool samples were screened for colistin-resistant klebsiella spp., yielding 32 crkp and 2 colistin-resistant klebsiella oxytoca. comparative whole-genome sequence analysis revealed that an in vitro-selected crkp mutant had an insertion sequence in its mgrb gene, as well as missense mutations in other selected clones. of the  34 colistin-resistant klebsiella spp. isolates, 14 (41.2%; 13 crkp and 1 k. oxytoca) from the four countries also had various defects in their mgrb genes, but no such defects were found in the cskp controls (p<10(-4)). few mutations were observed in pmrab compared with mgrb among the crkp isolates. the worldwide  emergence of crkp is a major public health concern. detection and surveillance of such strains are warranted to prevent an uncontrollable pandemic. inactivation of the phop/phoq regulator gene mgrb is associated with >/=40% of colistin resistance among the crkp isolates observed in this study.

TI  == single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections  nearly impossible to treat. to determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding  plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center patient population and hospital environment. we isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pantoea species. long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem  resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. we did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between k. pneumoniae, e.  cloacae, and c. freundii in the hospital environment. our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. in addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by k. pneumoniae, e. coli, e. cloacae, and pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == background: worldwide, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a clinical problem. surface disinfectant cleaners (sdcs) that are effective against these bacteria are needed for use in high risk areas around patients and on multi-touch surfaces. we determined the efficacy of several sdcs  against clinically relevant bacterial species with and without common types of multidrug resistance. methods: bacteria species used were atcc strains; clinical  isolates classified as antibiotic-susceptible; and multi-resistant clinical isolates from klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens  (all oxa-48 and kpc-2); acinetobacter baumannii (oxa-23); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (vim-1); and achromobacter xylosoxidans (atcc strain). experiments were carried out according to en 13727:2012 in quadruplicate under dirty conditions. the five  evaluated sdcs were based on alcohol and an amphoteric substance (aas), an oxygen-releaser (or), surface-active substances (sas), or surface-active-substances plus aldehydes (sasa; two formulations). bactericidal concentrations of sdcs were determined at two different contact times. efficacy was defined as a log10 >/= 5 reduction in bacterial cell count. results: sdcs based on aas, or, and sas were effective against all six species irrespective of  the degree of multi-resistance. the sasa formulations were effective against the  bacteria irrespective of degree of multi-resistance except for one of the four p. aeruginosa isolates (vim-1). we found no general correlation between sdc efficacy and degree of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: sdcs were generally effective against gram-negative bacteria with and without multidrug resistance. sdcs are therefore suitable for surface disinfection in the immediate proximity of patients. single bacterial isolates, however, might have reduced susceptibility to selected biocidal agents.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in north america 2010-2011.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. this report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in north america in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) identified in esbl-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of enterobacteriaceae. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. the incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ampc), and bla(kpc) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  == ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
AB  == ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and  ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were  consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most  frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l).  in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.

TI  == high incidence and endemic spread of ndm-1-positive enterobacteriaceae in henan province, china.
AB  == the emergence and spread of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing  carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) present an urgent threat to human health. in china, the bla(ndm-1 gene has been reported mostly in acinetobacter spp. but is rarely found in enterobacteriaceae. here, we report a high incidence  and endemic spread of ndm-1-producing cre in henan province in china. sixteen (33.3%) of the 48 cre isolates obtained from patients during june 2011 to july 2012 were positive for bla(ndm-1), and the gene was found to be carried on plasmids of various sizes ( approximately 55 to approximately 360 kb). these plasmids were readily transferrable to recipient escherichia coli by conjugation, conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics, and belonged to multiple replicon types. the bla(ndm-1)-positive cre isolates were genetically diverse, and six new multilocus sequence typing (mlst) sequence types were linked to the carriage of ndm-1. five of the isolates were classified as extensively drug-resistant (xdr) isolates, four of which also carried the fosa3 gene conferring resistance to fosfomycin, an alternative drug for treating infections by cre. in each bla(ndm-1)-positive cre isolate, the bla(ndm-1) gene was downstream of an intact  isaba125 element and upstream of the blembl gene. furthermore, gene environment analysis suggested the possible transmission of bla(ndm-1)-containing sequences from acinetobacter spp. to klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. these findings reveal the emergence and active transmission of ndm-1-positive cre in china and underscore the need for heightened measures to control their further spread.

TI  == conversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol by citrobacter freundii and hafnia alvei - newly isolated strains from the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == in this study, nearly 4000 bacterial strains from the family of enterobacteriaceae isolated from different environments were screened for ability to convert glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd). the aim of the research was to isolate 1,3-pd producers from the natural environment, identify and characterize  the best isolates. three selective media were tested to usefulness in the isolation of bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae. only, 28% of examined isolates could synthesize 1,3-pd from glycerol. 1,3-pd producing bacteria were identified by api 20e tests and 16s rrna sequences to be klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii and hafnia alvei. it is the first time,  when the fermentation glycerol to 1,3-pd by h. alvei was investigated. the selected strains (c. freundii ad119 and h. alvei ad27) were analyzed on a bioreactor scale under constant ph value 7.0 at temperature of 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c. after 40h in batch fermentation, h. alvei ad27 produced 11.3g/l of  1,3-pd at 37 degrees c. for c. freundii ad119, the best results were obtained at  temperature of 30 degrees c. after 24h of fermentation, the 1,3-pd concentration  reached above 23 g/l of 1,3-pd.

TI  == pediatric multicenter evaluation of the verigene gram-negative blood culture test for rapid detection of inpatient bacteremia involving gram-negative organisms, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases.
AB  == we evaluated the investigational use only (iuo) version of the rapid verigene gram-negative blood culture test (bc-gn), a microarray that detects 9 genus/species targets (acinetobacter spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli/shigella spp., klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and 6 antimicrobial resistance determinants (blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blavim, blaimp,  and blaoxa) directly from positive blood cultures. bc-gn was performed on positive bact/alert pediatric fan and bactec peds plus blood cultures with gram-negative organisms at two tertiary pediatric centers. vitek ms (biomerieux,  durham, nc) was used to assign gold standard organism identification. the check mdr ct-102 microarray (check points b.v., wageningen, netherlands) was used as an alternative method for detecting resistance determinants. in total, 104 organisms were isolated from 97 clinical blood cultures. bc-gn correctly detected 26/26 cultures with acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens, 5/6 with citrobacter spp., 13/14 with enterobacter spp., 23/24 with e. coli, 2/3 with k. oxytoca, 16/17 with k. pneumoniae, and 0/1 with proteus spp. bc-gn appropriately  reported negative bc-gn results in 8/13 blood cultures that grew organisms that were not represented on the microarray but failed to detect targets in 3/5 cultures that grew multiple gram-negative organisms. bc-gn detected 5/5 and 1/1 clinical blood cultures with blactx-m and blavim. all 6 results were corroborated by check mdr ct-102 microarray testing. the verigene bc-gn test has the potential to expedite therapeutic decision making in pediatric patients with gram-negative  bacteremia. sensitivity was satisfactory but may be suboptimal in mixed gram-negative blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of an automated rapid diagnostic assay for detection of gram-negative  bacteria and their drug-resistance genes in positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the performance of the verigene gram-negative blood culture nucleic  acid test (bc-gn; nanosphere, northbrook, il, usa), an automated multiplex assay  for rapid identification of positive blood cultures caused by 9 gram-negative bacteria (gnb) and for detection of 9 genes associated with beta-lactam resistance. the bc-gn assay can be performed directly from positive blood cultures with 5 minutes of hands-on and 2 hours of run time per sample. a total of 397 gnb positive blood cultures were analyzed using the bc-gn assay. of the 397 samples, 295 were simulated samples prepared by inoculating gnb into blood culture bottles, and the remaining were clinical samples from 102 patients with positive blood cultures. aliquots of the positive blood cultures were tested by the bc-gn assay. the results of bacterial identification between the bc-gn assay  and standard laboratory methods were as follows: acinetobacter spp. (39 isolates  for the bc-gn assay/39 for the standard methods), citrobacter spp. (7/7), escherichia coli (87/87), klebsiella oxytoca (13/13), and proteus spp. (11/11); enterobacter spp. (29/30); klebsiella pneumoniae (62/72); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (124/125); and serratia marcescens (18/21); respectively. from the 102 clinical samples, 104 bacterial species were identified with the bc-gn assay, whereas 110  were identified with the standard methods. the bc-gn assay also detected all beta-lactam resistance genes tested (233 genes), including 54 bla(ctx-m), 119 bla(imp), 8 bla(kpc), 16 bla(ndm), 24 bla(oxa-23), 1 bla(oxa-24/40), 1 bla(oxa-48), 4 bla(oxa-58), and 6 blavim. the data shows that the bc-gn assay provides rapid detection of gnb and beta-lactam resistance genes in positive blood cultures and has the potential to contributing to optimal patient management by earlier detection of major antimicrobial resistance genes.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == secretion of a pneumococcal type ii secretion system pilus correlates with dna uptake during transformation.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free dna liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for dna transformation and the fate of dna when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which dna in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. this plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)g locus, and, after assembly, it  is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. heterologous pneumococcal pilus  expression in escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pule-k putative pilin genes of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system with the complete  comg locus. in the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to dna transformation. a model for dna transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous dna to gain access to dna receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == [carbapenem resistance in esbl positive enterobacteriaceae isolates causing invasive infections].
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaeceae isolates recovered from invasive infections, in hacettepe university hospital, ankara, turkey, between 2005-2009, by phenotypic and genotypic methods. a total of 210 non-duplicated escherichia coli (n= 153), klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 47) and klebsiella oxytoca (n= 10) isolates which were  all determined to be extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive with the bd phoenix automated identification and antibiotic susceptibility system (sparks, usa), were included in the study. the isolates were recovered from patients with  bloodstream infections. susceptibility of the isolates to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was detected with microdilution method according to the standards of clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. doripenem susceptibility was detected by the e-test (biomerieux, hazelwood, usa). all isolates which were found to be non-susceptible to any of the carbapenem antibiotics tested, were characterized by the phenotypic confirmatory tests and the presence of the resistance genes; blaampc, blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blaoxa, blaimp ve blavim were screened by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). among the 210 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae  blood isolates, 23 (11%) were identified as non-susceptible to any of the carbapenems tested. resistance rates for imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem were 5.7% (n= 12), 1.9% (n= 4) and 2.4% (n= 5), respectively. doripenem was more active than the other carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 1.0%. seven of 23 isolates were esbl negative with cefotaxime/clavulanic acid (ctx/cla) and ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (caz/cla) combined disk diffusion test, however, six  of them were esbl positive with the addition of boronic acid (ba) to ctx/cla. among the three isolates positive for modifiye hodge test (mht) and/or ertapenem-ba tests, blaoxa-48 was detected in one and blaampc in the other. phenotypic pampc activity was present in three k.pneumoniae isolates of which one was positive for blaampc gene. one k.pneumoniae isolate resistant to all carbapenems with mics > 256 microg/ml and positive for phenotypic meropenem-ba, mht, imipenem-edta, ceftazidime-caz/cla, cefoxitin-ba production, was found to inhabit blaoxa-48 gene. five isolates were positive for blaoxa-1 and one for blaoxa-10. two isolates were positive for blactx-m, however blaimp, blavim and blandm-1 genes were not detected among the isolates. in conclusion, carbapenem non-susceptibility which was low among the enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in our center, was mostly attributed to the presence of blaoxa type carbapenemases and no accumulation of blakpc and blandm were detected.

AB  == a subset of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends that were positive for the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypic confirmatory  test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem mic of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for esbl genes. most esbl phenotype e. coli or k. pneumoniae possessed an esbl gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were removed. this rate was lower for p. mirabilis (73.4 %) and k. oxytoca (62.5 %). virtually all esbl-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [clsi or european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints)]. fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (clsi breakpoints). in addition, 21.1 % of e. coli, 25 % of k. oxytoca and 78.7 % of p. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but esbl positive. this suggests that clsi breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect esbls. the lower eucast breakpoints detected esbls in e. coli and k. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of esbl-positive isolates of p. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. for isolates with ertapenem mics >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate esbl phenotype analysis was observed for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). if carbapenemase-positive k. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. the positive predictive values for the esbl phenotypic test with e. coli and k. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively.  we therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic esbl-positive p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca with molecular analysis.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

TI  == detection of maga gene in klebsiella spp. isolated from clinical samplesdetection of maga.
AB  == objective(s): klebsiella infections are caused mainly by k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca. in the last two decades, a new type of invasive klebsiella pneumoniae which contains mucoviscosity-associated gene (maga) has emerged. the aim of this  study was to investigate the prevalence of maga gene and to detect antimicrobial  susceptibility patterns of klebsiella spp. isolated from clinical samples. materials and methods: klebsiella isolates were collected from patients admitted  to referral hospitals of hamadan, iran, during a 12-month period from 2007 to 2008. the samples were analyzed by conventional microbiological methods and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the hypermucoviscosity (hv) phenotype of klebsiella isolates was characterized by formation of viscous strings >5 mm as a  positive test. the susceptibility of isolates to routine antibiotics was assessed by agar disk diffusion method. results: out of 105 klebsiella isolates, 96.2% was identified as k. pneumoniae and 3.8% as k. oxytoca by pcr. maga gene was detected in 4 (3.8%) isolates of k. pneumoniae. the isolates of k. oxytoca contained no maga gene. from 4 isolates with positive maga gene, two of them were hv+ and two  were hv- phenotype. overall, sixty-four isolates (60.95%) of k. pneumoniae showed an hv positive phenotype and all isolates of k. oxytoca were hv- phenotype. the most effective antibiotics against the isolates were tobramycin (79.05%), ceftazidime (79.05%), ceftizoxime (78.09%), ciprofloxacin (76.19%), ceftriaxone (76.24%) and amikacin (74.29%). conclusion: the results suggest that there is also maga associated serotype of the k. pneumoniae in this region. in addition, the presence of hv+ phenotype may not be associated with maga.

TI  == the prevalence of carbapenemase genes and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae from five teaching hospitals in central china.
AB  == we investigated the prevalence of beta-lactamase genes and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants in 51 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) from five teaching hospitals in central china. the prevalence of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae was 1.0% (51/5012). of  51 cre, 31 (60.8%) isolates were positive for one tested carbapenemase gene, while 10 (19.6%) were simultaneously positive for two tested carbapenemase genes. the positive rates of bla kpc-2, bla ndm-1, bla imp-4, bla imp-26 and bla imp-8 were 54.9%, 17.6%, 11.8%, 11.8% and 3.9%, respectively. of 10 cre with two carbapenemase genes, three, five, one and one were positive for bla kpc-2 and bla imp-4, bla kpc-2 and bla imp-26, bla kpc-2 and bla imp-8, and bla kpc-2 and bla ndm-1, respectively. eight of nine bla ndm-1-positive isolates lacked carbapenemases by the modified hodge test, while 27/28 isolates harbouring bla kpc-2 were positive for carbapenemases determined by this test; 41.2% of the cre-positive isolates also harboured esbl genes in various combinations (three and two positive for bla kpc-2 also carried bla dha-1 and bla cmy-2). the positive rates of qnrs1, qnra1, qnrb and aac-(6/)-ib-cr in cre were 25.5%, 9.8%,  23.5% and 15.7%, respectively. in particular, 7/9 isolates harbouring bla ndm-1 were positive for these quinolone resistance genes, of which five carried qnrs1 and two carried qnrs1 and qnrb4. all but two of 29 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were grouped into 20 clonal clusters by pfge, with the predominant cluster accounting for four bla kpc-2-positive isolates distributed in the same hospital. we conclude that there is a high prevalence of bla ndm-1 and pmqr determinants in cre isolates in central china. multiple resistance determinants in various combinations co-exist in these strains and we report for the first time the co-existence of bla kpc-2 and bla imp-26 in a strain of klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae in the nine u.s. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  == escherichia coli (328 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (296), klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine u.s. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. the highest esbl rates were  noted for k. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the mid-atlantic and west south central census regions. ctx-m group 1 (including  ctx-m-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the united states but was more prevalent in the west south central, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions. kpc producers (118 strains [112 k. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the mid-atlantic region (58 strains). thirteen kpc producers also carried blactx-m. shv genes encoding esbl activity were detected among 176 isolates. other beta-lactamase genes observed were ctx-m group 9 (72 isolates), fox (10), tem esbl (9), dha (7), ctx-m group 2 (3), ndm-1 (2 [colorado]), and ctx-m groups 8 and 25 (1). additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. kpc producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml)  and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. overall, meropenem (mic50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (mic50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. ndm-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. the diversity and increasing prevalence of  beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from u.s. hospitals.

TI  == long-term dissemination of acquired ampc beta-lactamases among klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in portuguese clinical settings.
AB  == we investigated the occurrence, diversity and molecular epidemiology of genes coding for acquired ampc beta-lactamases (qampc) among clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible chromosomal ampcs in portugal. a total of 675 isolates non-susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins obtained from four  hospitals and three community laboratories during a 7-year period (2002-2008) were analysed. the presence of genes coding for qampc was investigated by phenotypic criteria, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, conjugation assays and clonal  analysis were performed by standard procedures. the presence of bla(qampc) genes  was detected in 50 % (50/100; 41 klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 escherichia coli, 4 klebsiella oxytoca) of the presumptive qampc producers. dha-1, detected in those  species, was the most prevalent qampc (94 %, 47/50), being identified since 2003  and throughout the studied period in different institutions. despite the high clonal diversity observed, three dha-1-producing klebsiella spp. clones were more frequently identified. cmy-2 (6 %, 3/50) was observed in b1-e. coli clones. conjugative transfer was only observed in one (2 %) cmy-2-producing isolate. most qampc producers (94 %, 47/50) co-expressed shv-type and/or oxa-1 or ctx-m-32 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). to the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular epidemiology and the long-term dissemination of qampc-producing enterobacteriaceae in portuguese clinical settings, highlighting an evolution towards a more complex epidemiological situation regarding cephalosporin resistance in portugal.

TI  == evaluation of the betalacta test, a rapid test detecting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == for decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) have been major drugs used to  treat infections due to enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. the betalacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3gc-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. a multicenter prospective study conducted  in 5 french and belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant  or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3gc resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. the rates of 3gc resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri (7/124). the sensitivities and specificities of the betalacta  test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. false-negative results were mainly related to 3gc-resistant strains producing ampc beta-lactamase. interestingly, the test was positive for all 3gc-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241).  the positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3gc resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. the negative predictive values were 99% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. in conclusion, the betalacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == first canadian outbreak of enterobacteriaceae-expressing klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase type 3.
AB  == background: organisms expressing klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) are found in several regions worldwide but are rarely detected in canada. the first outbreak of kpc-expressing strains of enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in a university-affiliated hospital intensive care unit (icu) in canada is described.  methods: enterobacteriaceae isolates that were flagged by the vitek 2 (biomerieux, france) system as possible carbapenemase producers were subjected to the modified hodge test. modified hodge test-positive organisms were analyzed by  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, tested for kpc and other beta-lactamase genes by polymerase chain reaction analysis and underwent subsequent nucleic acid sequencing. antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by vitek 2 and  etest (biomerieux, france). a chart review was conducted to establish epidemiological links. results: during the study period, 10 unique enterobacteriaceae isolates expressing kpc were detected from nine icu patients.  five patients had infections (three pneumonias, one surgical site infection, one  urinary tract infection). isolates included escherichia coli (5), klebsiella oxytoca (2), serratia marcescens (2) and citrobacter freundii (1). polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing confirmed the presence of kpc-3 in all isolates; four also carried tem, two ctx-m and one cmy-2. the imipenem minimum inhibitory concentrations as determined by etest ranged from 0.75 mug/ml to >/=32 mug/ml. pulsed field gel electrophoresis clonal patterns and patient location in  the icu revealed presumptive horizontal transmission events. conclusions: in the  present study, enterobacteriaceae isolates with kpc are emerging and can result in serious infections. the kpc gene can spread via plasmids to different genera of the enterobacteriaceae family. the dissemination of kpc in enterobacteriaceae  and the consequences for treatment and infection control measures warrant a high  degree of vigilance among clinicians and microbiologists.

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-encoding genes among enterobacteriaceae bacteremia isolates collected in 26 u.s. hospitals: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2010).
AB  == enterobacteriaceae bacteremia isolates (n = 195; 6.4% overall) collected from 26  u.s. hospitals located in 20 states were screened for various beta-lactamase classes. a total of 175 isolates carried one to eight acquired beta-lactamase genes of 44 types that were detected in 55 combinations. eighty-five (43.6%) strains carried blactx-m, and blactx-m-15 was the most prevalent (33.8%). genes encoding oxa-1/30 (often associated with blactx-m-15), cmy-2, shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls), and tem-1 were also prevalent. among 33 carbapenem-resistant strains, 28 carried blakpc-2 or blakpc-3 (17 and 11 strains, respectively), and those were recovered mostly in the new york city area (16 strains) and houston, tx (9 strains). fourteen new shv variants were identified among klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying one or multiple shv alleles, three  carrying g238s and/or e240k amino acid alterations that confer esbl activity. only two of eight k. oxytoca isolates carried acquired beta-lactamases, but most  had mutations on the blaoxy promoter region, and three new oxy-encoding genes were characterized. concordance between a commercial nucleic acid-based microarray (check-mdr ct101) and reference methods was noted for 105/109 (97.2%)  strains. thirty-two strains having genes that are not targeted by the commercial  system were detected (oxa esbls, per, pse, or intrinsic genes). overall, a great  variety of enzymes were observed, with numerous strains carrying multiple genes.  rates of ctx-m-producing strains appear to be increasing in u.s. hospitals (26.6% in 2007 to 43.8% for 2010) participating in the sentry program. furthermore, the  check-points system seems to be a reliable, robust, and user-friendly assay for detection of enzyme-mediated resistance.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

TI  == prevalence and mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae isolates from 24 hospitals in belgium.
AB  == objectives: to determine the point prevalence of carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (cnse) and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) isolates among hospitalized patients in belgium. methods: twenty-four hospital-based laboratories prospectively collected 200 non-duplicated enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients over a 2 month period. all isolates were screened locally for decreased susceptibility to carbapenem drugs using a disc diffusion method according to clsi interpretative criteria. cnse strains were referred centrally for confirmation of carbapenemase by phenotypic and molecular testing. results: from february to april 2012, 158 of the 4564 screened enterobacteriaceae isolates were categorized as non-susceptible to carbapenems, resulting in a point prevalence of cnse of 3.5% (95% ci: 2.9%-4.2%; range per centre: 0.5%-8.5%). of the 125 referred cnse isolates, 11 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [oxa-48 (n = 7), kpc type (n = 3) and ndm type (n = 1)], 1 oxa-48-positive escherichia coli isolate and 1 kpc-positive  klebsiella oxytoca isolate were detected in eight hospitals. none of the 72 carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacter spp. isolates were confirmed as cpe. the  minimal estimated point prevalence of cpe isolates was 0.28% (13/4564; 95% ci: 0.13%-0.44%) overall (range per centre: 0%-1.5%). conclusions: despite the overall low prevalence of cnse found in this study, the detection of cpe isolates in one-third of the participating centres raises concerns and highly suggests the spread and establishment of cpe in belgian hospitals.

TI  == differential distribution of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in clinical enterobacteria with unusual phenotypes of quinolone susceptibility from  argentina.
AB  == we studied a collection of 105 clinical enterobacteria with unusual phenotypes of quinolone susceptibility to analyze the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance (pmqr) and oqx genes and their implications for quinolone susceptibility. the oqxa and oqxb genes were found in 31/34 (91%) klebsiella pneumoniae and 1/3 klebsiella oxytoca isolates. however, the oqxa- and oqxb-harboring isolates lacking other known quinolone resistance determinants showed wide ranges of susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. sixty of the 105 isolates (57%) harbored at least one pmqr gene [qnrb19, qnrb10, qnrb2, qnrb1, qnrs1, or aac(6')-ib-cr)], belong to 8 enterobacterial species, and were disseminated throughout the country, and most of them were categorized as susceptible by the current clinical quinolone susceptibility breakpoints. we developed a disk diffusion-based method to improve the phenotypic detection of aac(6')-ib-cr. the most common pmqr genes in our collection [qnrb19, qnrb10, and  aac(6')-ib-cr] were differentially distributed among enterobacterial species, and two different epidemiological settings were evident. first, the species associated with community-acquired infections (salmonella spp. and escherichia coli) mainly harbored qnrb19 (a unique pmqr gene) located in small cole1-type plasmids that might constitute its natural reservoirs. qnrb19 was not associated  with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. second, the species associated with hospital-acquired infections (enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., and serratia marcescens) mainly harbored qnrb10 in iscr1-containing class 1 integrons that may also have aac(6')-ib-cr as a cassette within the variable region. these two pmqr genes were strongly associated with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. therefore, this differential distribution of pmqr genes is strongly influenced by their linkage or lack of linkage to integrons.

TI  == molecular characterization of class 1 integrons and gene cassettes in multidrug resistant (mdr) klebsiella spp. isolated from hospitalized and outpatients in iran, 2009.
AB  == background and objectives: klebsiella species are of the most common bacteria involved in nosocomial and urinary tract infections. genetic elements such as class 1 integrons have an important role in the resistance development. in this study, the share of class 1 integrons, the genetic characterization of the integron cassettes and pfge profiles of the clinical klebsiella isolates are evaluated in besat university hospital of sanandaj, iran. methods: isolates from  17890 clinical specimens were identified by api20e. antibiotic susceptibility testing and mic were done for mdr isolates. for investigating class 1 integrons and gene cassettes, pcr by inti1 integrase and 5'-cs/3'-cs were performed. integrated gene cassettes were analyzed by pcr-rflp and sequencing. pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis was carried out for studying of clonality outbreak of isolates. results: thirty five klebsiella spp. were isolated and included 29 k. pneumoniae and 6 k. oxytoca. all the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems while other antibiotics showed high resistant profile. in all klebsiella spp. pcr for inti1 integrase and 5'-cs/3'-cs were positive (100%). sequencing for prevalent bands of internal variable regions between 5'-cs/3'-cs showed arr-5, orfd-aaca4 and aad5- dfra17. pfge analysis showed 18 clusters in k. pneumoniae with clonality relatedness in some cases but no relatedness among k. oxytoca isolates. conclusion: high prevalence of class 1 integron carrying gene cassettes confirms that integron-mediated antimicrobial gene cassettes are important in klebsiella spp. resistance profile. clone diffusions of mdr klebsiella spp. which harbor class 1 integrons have threaten the potential in the resistance development in our clinical settings.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == multi-functional analysis of klebsiella pneumoniae fimbrial types in adherence and biofilm formation.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen frequently associated with nosocomially acquired infections. host cell adherence and biofilm formation of k. pneumoniae isolates is mediated by type 1 (t1p) and type 3 (mr/k) pili whose major fimbrial subunits are encoded by the fima and mrka genes, respectively. the e. coli common pilus (ecp) is an adhesive structure produced by all e. coli pathogroups and a homolog of the ecpabcde operon is present in the k. pneumoniae  genome. in this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of these three fimbrial genes among a collection of 69 clinical and environmental k. pneumoniae  strains and to establish a correlation with fimbrial production during cell adherence and biofilm formation. the pcr-based survey demonstrated that 96% of the k. pneumoniae strains contained ecpa and 94% of these strains produced ecp during adhesion to cultured epithelial cells. eighty percent of the strains forming biofilms on glass produced ecp, suggesting that ecp is required, at least in vitro, for expression of these phenotypes. the fim operon was found in 100% of the strains and t1p was detected in 96% of these strains. while all the strains examined contained mrka, only 57% of them produced mr/k fimbriae, alone or together with ecp. in summary, this study highlights the ability of k. pneumoniae strains to produce ecp, which may represent a new important adhesive structure of this organism. further, it defines the multi-fimbrial nature of the interaction of this nosocomial pathogen with host epithelial cells and inert surfaces.

AB  == klebsiella bacteria have emerged as an increasingly important cause of community-acquired nosocomial infections. extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in hospitalised patients has led to both increased carriage of klebsiella and the development of multidrug-resistant strains that frequently produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and/or other defences against antibiotics. many of these strains are highly virulent and exhibit a strong propensity to spread. in this study, six lytic klebsiella bacteriophages were isolated from sewage-contaminated river water in georgia and characterised as phage therapy candidates. two of the phages were investigated in greater detail.  biological properties, including phage morphology, nucleic acid composition, host range, growth phenotype, and thermal and ph stability were studied for all six phages. limited sample sequencing was performed to define the phylogeny of the k. pneumoniae- and k. oxytoca-specific bacteriophages vb_klp_5 and vb_klox_2, respectively. both of the latter phages had large burst sizes, efficient rates of adsorption and were stable under different adverse conditions. phages reported in this study are double-stranded dna bacterial viruses belonging to the families podoviridae and siphoviridae. one or more of the six phages was capable of efficiently lysing ~63 % of klebsiella strains comprising a collection of 123 clinical isolates from georgia and the united kingdom. these phages exhibit a number of properties indicative of potential utility in phage therapy cocktails.

TI  == a nationwide study of mechanisms conferring reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in clinical escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. isolates.
AB  == background: enterobacteriaceae exerting a high level of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc) resistance have increased significantly in norway in the last decade. various mechanisms acting alone or in concert mediate variable levels of  esc resistance and pose great challenges in the implementation of screening strategies and treatment. this study was undertaken to document the prevalence of underlying mechanisms conferring resistance to escs in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca, before the increase in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains. methods: consecutive e. coli (n = 2213), k. pneumoniae (n = 303), and k. oxytoca (n = 66) isolates from 23 norwegian diagnostic laboratories were collected and examined for reduced susceptibility to escs. isolates displaying minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of > 2 mg/l by etest to cefpodoxime and/or mics > 1 mg/l to any other escs were included (n = 54; 35 e. coli, 11 k. pneumoniae, and 8 k. oxytoca). isoelectric focusing for the detection of beta-lactamases, and polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) with subsequent sequencing for detection of esbls ctx-m, tem, and shv, plasmid-mediated ampc, oxa subtypes,  and alterations of porin genes ompc and ompf, and quantitative reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr for investigation of enhanced expression of chromosomal ampc were performed. results: eight e. coli isolates (0.4%) were esbl producers and 20 (1.0%) were hyperproducers of the chromosomal ampc. three k. pneumoniae isolates (1.1%) were esbl producers, and all k. oxytoca isolates (n = 8; 13.6%) were oxy-hyperproducers. no definite mechanisms for reduced susceptibility to escs could be inferred for 7 e. coli (0.4%) and 8 k. pneumoniae (3.0%) isolates.  conclusions: this study identified chromosomal ampc-hyperproducing e. coli and oxy-hyperproducing k. oxytoca in addition to esbls in enterobacteriaceae as major mechanisms of resistance to esc, and documented their rates of prevalence for the first time in norway.

TI  == removal of pathogenic factors from 2,3-butanediol-producing klebsiella species by inactivating virulence-related wabg gene.
AB  == klebsiella species are the most extensively studied among a number of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bdo)-producing microorganisms. the ability to metabolize a wide variety of substrates together with the ease of cultivation made this microorganisms particularly promising for the application in industrial-scale production of 2,3-bdo. however, the pathogenic characteristics of encapsulated klebsiella species are considered to be an obstacle hindering their industrial applications. here, we removed the virulence factors from three 2,3-bdo-producing strains, klebsiella pneumoniae kctc 2242, klebsiella oxytoca kctc1686, and k. oxytoca atcc 43863 through site-specific recombination technique. we generated deletion mutation in wabg gene encoding glucosyltransferase which plays a key role in the synthesis of outer core lipopolysaccharides (lps) by attaching the first outer core residue d-galap to the o-3 position of the l,d-heppii residue. the morphologies and adhesion properties against epithelial cells were investigated, and the results indicated that the wabg mutant strains were devoid  of the outer core lps and lost the ability to retain capsular structure. the time profile of growth and 2,3-bdo production from k. pneumoniae kctc 2242 and k. pneumoniae kctc 2242 deltawabg were analyzed in batch culture with initial glucose concentration of 70 g/l. the growth was not affected by disrupting wabg gene, but the production of 2,3-bdo decreased from 31.27 to 22.44 g/l in mutant compared with that of parental strain. however, the productions of acetoin and lactate from wabg mutant strain were negligible, whereas that from parental strain reached to ~5 g/l.

AB  == our goal was to identify the bacteria inhabiting the reproductive system of the female oriental fruit fly, bactrocera dorsalis (hendel), and evaluate the chemotaxis of b. dorsalis to the metabolites produced by the bacteria. based on 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  (pcr-dgge), 18 operational taxonomic units (otus) were assigned to the five bacterial classes betaproteobacteria, alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, bacilli and actinobacteria. nine otus were assigned to gammaproteobacteria, which was the most highly represented class. enterobacteriaceae constituted the dominant family, and within this family, three genera and five species were identified, including enterobacter sakazakii, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, raoultella terrigena and enterobacter amnigenus. in this set, the first two species were the dominant components, and the latter three species were the minor ones. finally, we found that the metabolites produced by r. terrigena,  k. oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were attractive to the b. dorsalis adults, and in field studies, b. dorsalis adults were most attracted to k. oxytoca. collectively, our results suggest that the female reproductive system plays an important role in the transfer of enterobacteria from the gut to fruit. our data  may prompt the development of a female-targeted population control strategy for this fly.

AB  == klebsiella oxytoca is an opportunistic pathogen and is isolated at the second highest frequency among genus klebsiella from hospitalized patients. according to previous reports, the major virulence factors of k. pneumoniae include capsules and several kinds of pill, whereas the virulence factors of k. oxytoca have not been well investigated. we noticed an increased frequency of k. oxytoca isolates  from patients who had undergone a biliary tract operation in a general hospital from may through november, 2009. we then performed a pcr analysis of the virulence factors and an epidemiological analysis with capsular typing (serotyping) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for k. oxytoca of 11 blood isolates and 10 bile isolates. as a result, serotypes of k9, k15, k26, k31, k43, k47, k55, k70, and k79 were identified in these strains, and k1 and k2 which are frequent serotypes in k. pneumoniae strains were not observed. two blood isolates of the k55 serotype showed almost the same pfge pattern, suggesting that these isolates were very closely related and caused cross-infection in a hospital ward. strains of the k43 serotype were three blood isolates and 1 bile isolate, all of which showed different pfge patterns. there were no common isolates among  the blood and bile isolates. a pcr search revealed that fimh and mrkd genes which are relevant to type 1 and type 2 pili, respectively, were present in all strains, whereas kfubc, an iron uptake gene, and cf29a were detected in only a few strains. neither of the mucoid phenotype-related genes maga and rmpa was present in any strains. these results strongly suggest that type 1 and/or type 3  pili would have important roles in the pathogenesis of blood infection and bile infection caused by k. oxytoca.

TI  == isolation and characterization of multidrug-resistant klebsiella spp. isolated from shrimp imported from thailand.
AB  == a study was undertaken to isolate and characterize tetracycline and nalidixic acid-resistant klebsiella spp. in farm-raised, imported shrimp sold in the united states. sixty-seven multiple antibiotic-resistant klebsiella spp. strains were isolated from imported shrimp samples. using morphological and biochemical methods, fifty-three strains were tentatively identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and fourteen as k. oxytoca. although all isolates were resistant to tetracycline, only 8 were resistant to nalidixic acid. these 8 isolates were further screened by pcr for quinolone resistance genes (qnra, b, s, gyra, b and parc). pcr protocols failed to amplify any qnr genes. the purified pcr amplicons of gyra, gyrb and parc were sequenced and analyzed for point mutations that confer resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. analysis of the sequences of the gyra  amplicons from nalidixic acid-resistant klebsiella spp. indicated two point mutations in gyra at positions 83 (ser-->phe) and 87 (asp-->ala). sequence analysis of the parc amplicons indicated an amino acid change at position 80 (ser-->ile). no mutations were detected in gyrb. template dna from all isolates was screened for tetracycline resistance genes (teta-e). oligonucleotide primers  specifically targeting a 305-bp region of tetb and a 477-bp region of tetd successfully amplified sequences from 91.0 and 44.0% of the isolates, respectively. none of the isolates contained teta, tetc or tete genes. plasmids (2.0-16.0kb) were found in 23 of the 67 isolates. xbai-pfge identified 32 distinct macro restriction patterns (mrps) among the 61 multiple drug-resistant klebsiella spp. that were typable. our results indicate that imported shrimp is a reservoir for multidrug resistant klebsiella spp. and potential health risks posed by such strains should not be underestimated.

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == using nucleic acid microarrays to perform molecular epidemiology and detect novel beta-lactamases: a snapshot of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases throughout the world.
AB  == the worldwide dissemination of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)- and carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae is a major concern in both hospital and community settings. rapid identification of these resistant pathogens and the genetic determinants they possess is needed to assist in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. a collection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis isolates, including phenotypically esbl-positive (n = 1,093) and esbl-negative isolates (n = 59), obtained in 2008-2009 from a longitudinal surveillance study (smart) was examined using an in vitro nucleic acid-based microarray. this approach was used to detect and identify bla(esbl) (bla(shv), bla(tem), and bla(ctx-m) genes of groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) and bla(kpc) genes and was combined with selective pcr amplification and dna sequencing for complete characterization of the bla(esbl) and bla(kpc) genes. of the 1,093 phenotypically esbl-positive isolates, 1,041 were identified  as possessing at least one bla(esbl) gene (95.2% concordance), and 59 phenotypically esbl-negative isolates, used as negative controls, were negative.  several esbl variants of bla(tem) (n = 5), bla(shv) (n = 11), bla(ctx-m) (n = 19), and bla(kpc) (n = 3) were detected. a new bla(shv) variant, bla(shv-129), and a new bla(kpc) variant, bla(kpc-11), were also identified. the most common bla genes found in this study were bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-14), and bla(shv-12). using nucleic acid microarrays, we obtained a "molecular snapshot" of bla(esbl) genes in a current global population; we report that ctx-m-15 is still the dominant esbl and provide the first report of the new beta-lactamase variants bla(shv-129) and bla(kpc-11).

TI  == fermentation and evaluation of klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca on the production of 2,3-butanediol.
AB  == klebsiella is one of the genera that has shown unbeatable production performance  of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bd), when compared to other microorganisms. in this study, two klebsiella strains, k. pneumoniae (dsm 2026) and k. oxytoca (atcc 43863), were selected and evaluated for 2,3-bd production by batch and fed-batch fermentations using glucose as a carbon source. those strains' morphologies, particularly their capsular structures, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the maximum titers of 2,3-bd by k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca during 10 h batch fermentation were 17.6 and 10.9 g l(-1), respectively; in fed-batch cultivation, the strains showed the maximum titers of 50.9 and 34.1 g l(-1), respectively. although k. pneumoniae showed higher productivity, sem showed that it secreted large amounts of capsular polysaccharide, increasing pathogenicity and hindering the separation of cells from the fermentation broth during downstream processing.

TI  == [enterobacteriaceae and beta-lactams : wild susceptibility patterns].
AB  == four susceptibility patterns of wild types of enterobacteria against old beta-lactams including aminopenicillins, carboxypenicillins and first-generation  cephalosporins were individualized during the 1980s : susceptible, penicillinase  low level, cephalosporinase and a combination of penicillinase and cephalosporinase. such indirect detection of a mechanism of resistance allowed an interpretative reading for this class of antibiotics. at the present time, seven  susceptibility patterns were proposed for this family of gram negative bacilli. nevertheless, an analysis of results in terms of mics and diameters of inhibition zone sizes of the main bacterial species of enterobacteria, mainly obtained from  the databank of european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast), compared to that observed when overproducing strains were isolated in vivo and in vitro and to the type of beta-lactamase identified and their amino acid sequences conducted to a proposal of five susceptibility patterns. the fifth wild type individualized in several enterobacteria since 2005 is related to the synthesis of various chromosomal extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) which hydrolyze many beta-lactams including oxyimino-cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. their expression in a wild strain is characteristic and conducted  to our interest for their role as progenitors of the transferable ctm-m types. otherwise, a medical biologist must consider the possibility of selection of a mutant with a chromosomal overproduced beta-lactamase. but within the same beta-lactam susceptibility pattern such as for klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca or citrobacter amalonaticus, the spectrum of inactivation will be highly  variable according to the type of enzyme overproduced. finally, a nice synergy observed between clavulanic acid and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone or even aztreonam  does not mean anytime a transferable esbl. in some cases according to the result  of enterobacterial identification, the epidemiological impact will be very low, because without multidrug resistance (mdr).

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in enterobacteriaceae, recommending esbl confirmation with etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive esbl screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime mic >1 mg/l or an automated system esbl warning). twenty laboratories submitted 443 enterobacteriaceae with a positive esbl screen test and their confirmation test result (74%escherichia coli, 12%enterobacter cloacae, 8%klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%proteus mirabilis, 2%klebsiella oxytoca). presence of esbl genes was used as reference test. accuracy of local phenotypic esbl detection was 88%.  the positive predictive value (ppv) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (vitek-2: 69%, phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%k.  pneumoniae-27%k. oxytoca). a low ppv (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin mics <2 mg/l. local esbl confirmation had a ppv and negative predictive value (npv) of 93% and 90%, respectively. compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. combination disc was more specific than etest (91% versus 61%). confirmation tests were not reliable for p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca (ppv 33% and 38%, respectively, although npvs were 100%). in conclusion, performance of etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic esbl confirmation of p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic esbl confirmation, and by interpreting  isolates with a positive esbl alarm but an mic <2 mg/l for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as esbl-negative.

AB  == objective: the primary aim of this study was to determine age-stratified rates of co-existing bacterial meningitis in children with urinary tract infection (uti).  the secondary aims of this study were to determine the causative pathogens of uti, and the clinical features and outcome of children with co-existing meningitis. methods: analysis of data collected over a nine-year period at a tertiary pediatric hospital in australia. study population: children below 16 years of age with culture-confirmed uti and a paired csf sample. results: a total of 748 episodes in 735 cases were included in the final analysis. the commonest pathogens causing uti were escherichia coli (67.4%), enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (3.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). only two (1.2%; 95% ci: 0.15-4.36%) of 163 neonates (between 0 and 28 days of age) with uti had co-existing meningitis. both presented with pyrexia, irritability and lethargy, and recovered uneventfully with antibiotic treatment. there were no cases of co-existing meningitis among 499 infants (between 29 days and 12 months  of age) with uti (95% ci: 0.00-0.74%), or any of the 86 children aged 12 months or over (95% ci: 0.00-4.20%). conclusions: these findings indicate that clinicians should have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture in neonates with uti, as the risk of co-existing meningitis is not insignificant in this age  group. in contrast, beyond the neonatal period, the risk is small and a more selective approach is warranted.

TI  == dehydratase mediated 1-propanol production in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == background: with the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, the question of meeting the global energy demand is of great importance in the near future. as an effective solution, production of higher alcohols from renewable sources by microorganisms has been proposed to address both energy crisis and environmental  concerns. higher alcohols contain more than two carbon atoms and have better physiochemical properties than ethanol as fuel substitutes. results: we designed  a novel 1-propanol metabolic pathway by expanding the well-known 1,2-propanediol  pathway with two more enzymatic steps catalyzed by a 1,2-propanediol dehydratase  and an alcohol dehydrogenase. in order to engineer the pathway into e. coli, we evaluated the activities of eight different methylglyoxal synthases which play crucial roles in shunting carbon flux from glycolysis towards 1-propanol biosynthesis, as well as two secondary alcohol dehydrogenases of different origins that reduce both methylglyoxal and hydroxyacetone. it is evident from our results that the most active enzymes are the methylglyoxal synthase from bacillus subtilis and the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from klebsiella pneumoniae, encoded by mgsa and budc respectively. with the expression of these two genes and the e. coli ydjg encoding methylglyoxal reductase, we achieved the production of  1,2-propanediol at 0.8 g/l in shake flask experiments. we then characterized the  catalytic efficiency of three different diol dehydratases on 1,2-propanediol and  identified the optimal one as the 1,2-propanediol dehydratase from klebsiella oxytoca, encoded by the operon ppdabc. co-expressing this enzyme with the above 1,2-propanediol pathway in wild type e. coli resulted in the production of 1-propanol at a titer of 0.25 g/l. conclusions: we have successfully established  a new pathway for 1-propanol production by shunting the carbon flux from glycolysis. to our knowledge, it is the first time that this pathway has been utilized to produce 1-propanol in e. coli. the work presented here forms a basis  for further improvement in production. we speculate that dragging more carbon flux towards methylglyoxal by manipulating glycolytic pathway and eliminating competing pathways such as lactate generation can further enhance the production  of 1-propanol.

AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) have emerged as major causes of health care-associated infections worldwide. this diverse collection of organisms with various resistance mechanisms is associated with increased lengths of hospitalization, costs of care, morbidity, and mortality. the global spread of cre has largely been attributed to dissemination of a dominant strain of klebsiella pneumoniae producing a serine beta-lactamase, termed k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc). here we report an outbreak of kpc-producing cre infections in which the degree of horizontal transmission between strains and species of a promiscuous plasmid is unprecedented. sixteen isolates, comprising 11 unique strains, 6 species, and 4 genera of bacteria, were obtained from 14 patients over the first 8 months of the outbreak. of the 11 unique strains, 9 harbored the same highly promiscuous plasmid carrying the kpc gene bla(kpc). the remaining strains  harbored distinct bla(kpc) plasmids, one of which was carried in a strain of klebsiella oxytoca coisolated from the index patient and the other generated from transposition of the bla(kpc) element tn4401. all isolates could be genetically traced to the index patient. molecular epidemiological investigation of the outbreak was aided by the adaptation of nested arbitrary pcr (arb-pcr) for rapid  plasmid identification. this detailed molecular genetic analysis, combined with traditional epidemiological investigation, provides insights into the highly fluid dynamics of drug resistance transmission during the outbreak. importance the ease of horizontal transmission of carbapenemase resistance plasmids across strains, species, and genera of bacteria observed in this study has several important public health and epidemiological implications. first, it has the potential to promote dissemination of carbapenem resistance to new populations of enterobacteriaceae, including organisms of low virulence, leading to the establishment of reservoirs of carbapenem resistance genes in patients and/or the environment and of high virulence, raising the specter of untreatable community-associated infections. second, recognition of plasmid-mediated outbreaks, such as those described here, is problematic because analysis of resistance plasmids from clinical isolates is laborious and technically challenging. adaptation of nested arbitrary pcr (arb-pcr) to investigate the plasmid outbreak facilitated our investigation, and the method may be broadly applicable to other outbreaks due to other conserved mobile genetic elements. whether infection control measures that focus on preventing transmission of drug-resistant clones are effective in controlling dissemination of these elements is unknown.

TI  == ctx-m-15-producing escherichia coli clone b2-o25b-st131 and klebsiella spp. isolates in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents.
AB  == objectives: the global occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria in water environments is an increasing concern. treated wastewater was sampled daily over a 45 day period from the outflow of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in brno, czech republic, and examined for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria. methods: water samples were cultivated on macconkey agar with cefotaxime (2 mg/l) and individual colonies were examined for esbl production. phenotypic esbl-positive bacteria identified as escherichia coli or klebsiella spp. were tested for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, the  virulence gene afa/dra and the bla(ctx-m) upstream region. genetic relatedness was analysed by pfge, multilocus sequence typing and plasmid analysis. results: a total of 68 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were detected in 34 out of 45 wastewater samples. esbl-producing isolates included 26 e. coli isolates, 4 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate. the pandemic and multiresistant b2-o25b-st131 clone was predominant, being detected among 19 e. coli isolates, and 17 of the b2-o25b-st131 isolates were positive for the fia replicon and the afa/dra operon and had an is26 element flanking bla(ctx-m-15). seventeen of the b2-o25b-st131 isolates showed closely related pfge profiles (defined by 84% band similarity) and belonged to identical clonal groups. conclusions: the results highlight the inadequacy of the treatment process in removing multiresistant bacteria from municipal wastewater and point to a risk of transmission of clinically important multiresistant strains, such as the pandemic st131 clone, to the environment. this is the first study demonstrating the pandemic st131 clone in wastewater.

TI  == molecular characteristics of kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae at the early stage  of their dissemination in poland, 2008-2009.
AB  == after the first report in may 2008, the national reference center for susceptibility testing confirmed 113 cases of infection or colonization by kpc-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae in poland by the end of 2009. the vast majority of patients were found in 18 hospitals; three patients were diagnosed at outpatient clinics. most of the institutions were in the warsaw area, including three hospitals with the highest numbers of cases. when available, the data on previous hospitalizations often indicated that these hospitals were the probable acquisition sites; one patient arrived from new york. the group of 119 unique isolates consisted of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 114), followed by klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), and escherichia coli (n = 2). the k. pneumoniae isolates were dominated by the clone sequence type 258 (st258) (n = 111); others were st11 and st23. the st258 group was heterogeneous, with 28 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) subtypes, approximately 25 plasmid profiles, and nine beta-lactamase patterns differing by kpc variants (kpc-2 mainly), and shv-12, ctx-m-3, and tem-1-like enzymes. plasmids carrying bla(kpc)  genes varied in size (~48 to 250 kb), structure, and conjugation potential. transferable incfii(k) plasmids of ~110 to 160 kb, probably pkpqil or its derivatives, were observed in all k. pneumoniae clones and in k. oxytoca. also prevalent were nontypeable petkp50-like plasmids of ~50 kb, found in k. pneumoniae st258 and e. coli isolates (st93 and st224). two k. pneumoniae-e. coli pairs from single patients might represent the in vivo transfer of such plasmids. the striking diversity of kpc producers at the early stage of dissemination could result from several introductions of these bacteria into the country, their multidirectional evolution during clonal spread, and transfer of the plasmids.

TI  == nosocomial infection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing enterobacteriaceae in northeast brazil.
AB  == introduction: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are enzymes that degrade  beta-lactam antibiotics and have been reported to be an important cause of nosocomial infection in worldwide. methods: during 2009, 659 enterobacteria strains were isolated from different clinical specimens and tested for esbl production. the disk approximation test, combined disk method and addition of clavulanic acid were used for phenotypic detection of the esbl-producing strains  and pcr for detection of the bla(tem) and bla(ctx-m) genes. results: among the isolates, 125 were esbl producers. the bla(ctx-m) and bla(tem) genes were detected in 90.4% and 75% of the strains, respectively. most strains were isolated from urine. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent organism. microorganisms presented high resistance to the antibiotics. conclusions: these results support the need for extending esbl detection methods to different pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family because these methods are only currently standardized by the clsi for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus mirabilis. carbapenems were the antibiotic class of choice for the treatment of infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == genotypic characterization and in vitro activities of tigecycline and polymyxin b for members of the enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenem resistance in members of the enterobacteriaceae is increasing. to evaluate the effects of tigecycline and polymyxin b against carbapenem-non-susceptible pathogens, 89 representative clinical carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from seven  hospitals from four cities in china during 2006-2009: 30 serratia marcescens, 35  klebsiella pneumoniae, seven enterobacter cloacae, six enterobacter aerogenes, five escherichia coli, four citrobacter freundii and two klebsiella oxytoca isolates. twenty-eight s. marcescens isolates were indistinguishable. the 35 k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 12 clonal strains. among the 89 enterobacteriaceae isolates, 82 produced kpc-2, seven produced imp (three produced kpc-2 simultaneously), three did not produce any carbapenemases and nine were deficient in porins. polymyxin b was much more active than tigecycline against carbapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae. the mic(50) and mic(90) of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, polymyxin b and tigecycline were 8 and 32 microg  ml(-1), 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 16 and 128 microg ml(-1), 0.5 and 16 microg ml(-1), and 4 and 16 microg ml(-1), respectively. rates of susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem and polymyxin b were 30.0%, 27.5%, 2.5% and 89.2%  by clsi criteria. the rate of susceptibility to tigecycline was 40% and 17.5% by  food and drug administration (mic </=2 microg ml(-1)) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (mic </=1 microg ml(-1)) criteria, respectively. kpc-2- or imp-producing e. coli transconjugants exhibited reduced susceptibility to carbapenems but were susceptible to polymyxin b and tigecycline with an mic range of 0.5-2 microg ml(-1), 0.25-2 microg ml(-1), 0.5-4 microg ml(-1), 0.5 microg ml(-1) and 0.5-1 microg ml(-1). in conclusion, carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to production of kpc-2, and polymyxin b is active for the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == outcomes and genetic relatedness of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae at detroit medical center.
AB  == background: carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are rapidly emerging in hospitals in the united states and are posing a significant threat. to better understand the transmission dynamics and the acquisition of resistant strains, a  thorough analysis of epidemiologic and molecular characteristics was performed. methods: cre isolated at detroit medical center were analyzed from september 2008 to september 2009. bla(kpc) genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction  (pcr), and repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr) was used to determine  genetic similarity among strains. epidemiologic and outcomes analyses were performed. results: ninety-two unique patient cre isolates were recovered. sixty-eight strains (74%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 were klebsiella oxytoca,  15 were enterobacter species, and 2 were escherichia coli. fifteen isolates (16%) were resistant to colistin, 14 (16%) were resistant to tigecycline, and 2 were resistant to all antimicrobials tested. the mean +/- standard deviation age of patients was 63 +/- 2 years. sixty patients (68%) were admitted to the hospital from long-term care facilities. only 70% of patients received effective antimicrobial therapy when infection was suspected, with a mean time to appropriate therapy of 120 +/- 23 hours following sample culturing. the mean length of hospitalization after sample culturing was 18.6 +/- 2.5 days. of 57 inpatients, 18 (32%) died in the hospital. independent predictors for mortality were intensive care unit stay (odds ratio [or], 15.8; p = .003) and co-colonization with cre and either acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa (or, 17.2; p = .006). among k. pneumoniae cre, rep-pcr revealed 2 genetically related strains that comprised 70% and 20% of isolates, respectively. conclusions: in this large u.s. cohort of patients with cre infection, which reflects the modern continuum of medical care, co-colonization with cre and a. baumannii or p. aeruginosa was associated with increased mortality. two predominant clones of k. pneumoniae accounted for the majority of cases of cre infection.

TI  == molecular analysis of population structure and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella isolates from a three-year surveillance program in florence hospitals, italy.
AB  == we report the results of a three-year surveillance program of klebsiella spp. in  six hospitals in florence (italy). a total of 172 klebsiella isolates were identified and typed by aflp: 122 were k. pneumoniae and 50 were k. oxytoca. most k. pneumoniae (80%) and k. oxytoca (93%) showed unrelated aflp profiles. beside this heterogeneous population structure, we found five small epidemic clonal groups of k. pneumoniae. four of these groups were involved in outbreak events, three of which occurred in neonatal icus. the fifth clonal group spread in three  different wards of two hospitals. only one non-epidemic clonal group of k. oxytoca was detected. the frequencies of isolates with multiple antibiotic resistances increased with time; at the end of the study period, most k. pneumoniae were resistant to all the antibiotics tested. a pcr analysis of seven  ertapenem resistant isolates was unable to detect any of the major genes known to underlie carbapenem resistance in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == bacterial community composition of biological degreasing systems and health risk  assessment for workers.
AB  == biological degreasing system is a new technology based on the degradation capabilities of microorganisms to remove oil, grease, or lubricants from metal parts. no data is available about the potential biological health hazards in such system. thus, a health risk assessment linked to the bacterial populations present in this new degreasing technology is, therefore, necessary for workers. we performed both cultural and molecular approaches in several biological degreasing systems for various industrial contexts to investigate the composition and dynamics of bacterial populations. these biological degreasing systems did not work with the original bacterial populations. indeed, they were colonized by  a defined and restricted group of bacteria. this group replaced the indigenous bacterial populations known for degrading complex substrates. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pantoea agglomerans were important members of the microflora found in most of the biological degreasing systems. these bacteria might represent a potential health hazard for  workers.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == in antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the mic of levofloxacin.  to assess its judgement, we compared the mics of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem,  and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and  pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. mic distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously s. marcescens, e. cloacae and c. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low mic value than imipenem and panipenem. since the estrangements are appeared mic value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. in fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical mic distributions, thus the mic of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for  other fluoroquinolones. the existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low mic value of carbapenems was reported. for the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

AB  == infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. constitute severe problems. carbapenems are  commonly used to treat these infections. however, infections caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria show an increasing trend recently. the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibilities of esbl-producing e.coli and klebsiella spp. to ertapenem and other carbapenems. a total of 239 e.coli, 28 k.pneumoniae and 11 k.oxytoca strains isolated from clinical specimens (208 urine, 16 blood, 26 wound, 17 sterile body fluids, four tracheal aspirates and seven others) of hospitalized patients and outpatients between january 2007-february 2008, were included to the study. the isolates were identified by conventional methods, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by kirby bauer disc diffusion method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) standards. esbl production was tested by double disk diffusion method. when esbl production was indeterminate, cefotaxime-clavulanic acid e test (biomerieux, france) was used. according to the clsi standards modified hodge test was performed for carbapenem resistant isolates and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were detected for ertapenem (etest(r), biomerieux, france), imipenem and meropenem (m.i.c. evaluator strips, oxoid, uk). all of the  isolates were found susceptible to amikacin (278/278; 100%), whereas the susceptibility rates for imipenem/meropenem and ertapenem were 99.3% (276/278) and 98.6% (274/278), respectively. when evaluated individually, ertapenem susceptibilities of e.coli, k.pneumoniae and k.oxytoca strains were 99.2%, 96.4%  and 90.9%, respectively, while these rates were 100%, 96.4% and 90.9%, respectively, for imipenem/meropenem. carbapenem resistance was detected in two e.coli, one k.oxytoca and one k.pneumoniae isolates. while two klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to all of the tested carbapenems (mic > 32 microg/ml), two e.coli isolates were resistant to ertapenem (mic > 32 microg/ml) but susceptible to imipenem (mic= 0.25 microg/ml) and meropenem (mic= 0.5 microg/ml). carbapenemase production was demonstrated by modified hodge test in all of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. in conclusion, esbl-producing gram-negative isolates should be routinely tested with a screening method for carbapenemase activity and confirmation tests should be performed in suspected cases.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria  isolated from bovine mastitis in egypt.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases in egypt. multidrug resistance phenotypes were found in 34 of 112 (30.4%) gram-negative bacterial isolates, which harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (mdr) species were enterobacter cloacae (8 isolates, 7.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 6.3%), klebsiella oxytoca (7 isolates, 6.3%), escherichia coli (5 isolates, 4.5%), and citrobacter freundii (3 isolates, 2.7%). the most commonly observed resistance phenotypes were against ampicillin (97.0%), streptomycin (94.1%), tetracycline (91.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.2%), nalidixic acid (85.3%), and chloramphenicol (76.5%). class 1 integrons were detected in 28 (25.0%) isolates. the gene cassettes within class 1 integrons included those encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfra1, dfra5, dfra7, dfra12, dfra15, dfra17, and dfra25), aminoglycosides (aada1, aada2, aada5, aada7, aada12, aada22, and aac(3)-id), chloramphenicol (cmla), erythromycin (erea2), and rifampicin (arr-3). class 2 integrons were identified in 6 isolates (5.4%) with three different profiles. furthermore, the beta-lactamase encoding genes, bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), and bla(oxa), the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr, and the florfenicol resistance gene, flor, were also identified. to the best of our knowledge, the results identified class 2 integrons, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr from cases of mastitis for the first time. this is the first report of molecular characterization for antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis in africa.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae screened by the vitek 2 system.
AB  == the vitek 2 automated system (biomerieux) is one of the most widely used instruments in clinical microbiology laboratories for the identification and evaluation of the susceptibility profiles of bacteria including the detection of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. currently, the clinical and laboratory standards institute recommends the use of esbl confirmatory tests in addition to standard susceptibility testing. in order to evaluate the accuracy of vitek 2-positive results regarding clinical isolates of e. coli (n = 110) and k.  pneumoniae (n = 72), four additional esbl detection systems were compared: the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems) and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring), and two manual systems as confirmatory tests,  the etest (ab biodisk) and double disc diffusion (dds) test. epidemiological data regarding the tested strains were also collected and their susceptibility phenotypes were determined. the four methods resulted in concordant results for 126 of the 182 strains. however, the different tests displayed distinct results:  the vitek 2 system was in disagreement in 23.9 % of cases with dds, in 15.3 % with etest, in 23 % with the microscan walkaway-96 system and in 23.6 % with the  phoenix automated microbiology system. epidemiological data indicated that the majority of esbl-positive e. coli strains were isolated from patients admitted to internal medicine wards (72.7 %), whilst k. pneumoniae esbl-positive isolates were equally distributed between internal medicine wards (45.8 %) and intensive care units (45.8 %). most of these strains were isolated from urine. in contrast  to esbl-negative isolates, the esbl-positive strains displayed multiple drug resistance, namely to quinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. no significant resistance to carbapenems was detected. overall, this study demonstrates the need for a confirmatory test following positive esbl detection with the vitek 2 system (panel ast-037), which  appears to yield a large number of false-positive results.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 ast-n111 card for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca compared to esbl etests and combination disk methods.
AB  == the vitek 2 ast-n111 card was evaluated for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by testing 51 esbl positive and 50 esbl negative isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and k. oxytoca. the occurrence of beta-lactamase genes was confirmed by pcr and sequencing. the advanced expert system (aes) of the vitek 2 system achieved sensitivity and specificity values of 100% and 96.0%, respectively. the esbl test of the vitek 2 ast-n111 card showed a sensitivity of  92.1% and a specificity of 90.0%. contradictory results obtained with the two vitek 2 tools could be clarified by combination disk tests in nine of 11 isolates. the combined use of aes and esbl tests of the ast-n111 card in association with combination disk tests in case of contradictory results seems to be a reliable method for esbl detection.

TI  == is selective digestive decontamination useful in controlling aerobic gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases?
AB  == aims: to identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb-esbl); to establish whether agnb-esbl, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) on abnormal carriage of agnb-esbl. design and setting:  all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. all agnb were tested for esbl, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. the picu uses sdd (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin e/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. patients who had at least one agnb-esbl were included in the study. results: during the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the picu. there were 39  patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for agnb-esbl. twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with enterobacter cloacae, 7 with citrobacter freundii, 5 with klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with escherichia coli. in the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. molecular typing confirmed that there were five different  strains of k. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. conclusions: sdd is an effective measure to control agnb-esbl and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. when tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving agnb clearance.

TI  == sources of klebsiella and raoultella species on dairy farms: be careful where you walk.
AB  == klebsiella spp. are a common cause of mastitis, milk loss, and culling on dairy farms. control of klebsiella mastitis is largely based on prevention of exposure  of the udder to the pathogen. to identify critical control points for mastitis prevention, potential klebsiella sources and transmission cycles in the farm environment were investigated, including oro-fecal transmission, transmission via the indoor environment, and transmission via the outdoor environment. a total of  305 samples was collected from 3 dairy farms in upstate new york in the summer of 2007, and included soil, feed crops, feed, water, rumen content, feces, bedding,  and manure from alleyways and holding pens. klebsiella spp. were detected in 100% of rumen samples, 89% of water samples, and approximately 64% of soil, feces, bedding, alleyway, and holding pen samples. detection of klebsiella spp. in feed  crops and feed was less common. genotypic identification of species using rpob sequence data showed that klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common species in rumen content, feces, and alleyways, whereas klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella variicola, and raoultella planticola were the most frequent species among isolates from soil and feed crops. random amplified polymorphic dna-based strain  typing showed heterogeneity of klebsiella spp. in rumen content and feces, with a median of 4 strains per 5 isolates. observational and bacteriological data support the existence of an oro-fecal transmission cycle, which is primarily maintained through direct contact with fecal contamination or through ingestion of contaminated drinking water. fecal shedding of klebsiella spp. contributes to  pathogen loads in the environment, including bedding, alleyways, and holding pens. hygiene of alleyways and holding pens is an important component of klebsiella control on dairy farms.

TI  == [prevalence of esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae in large moravian hospitals (czech republic)].
AB  == background: bacterial infections have become an important issue in current medicine. recently, their frequency and severity have significantly increased as  a result of the rising number of resistant bacteria. one of important mechanisms  of resistance is production of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, namely the esbl type. the study aimed at determining the frequency of esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae in three large hospitals in moravia, the eastern part of the czech republic. material and methods: enterobacteriaceae were isolated from clinical material obtained from patients hospitalized in the university hospital  olomouc, teaching hospital ostrava and bata regional hospital zlin throughout 2009. standard microbiology techniques were used for identification. the production of esbls was determined by the modified double-disk synergy test. esbl-positive isolates of escherichia coli from icu patients were subjected to basic genetic analysis. results and conclusion: during the study period, a total  of 12,922 strains from the enterobacteriaceae family were detected. the esbl phenotype was found in 907 cases, i.e. 7 % of all isolates. the most prevalent species of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and escherichia coli. a comparison of general wards and icus revealed a higher percentage of esbl-positive strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and a lower proportion of esbl-positive escherichia coli isolates in intensive care patients. when assessing the patients' clinical material, esbl-producing strains were most frequently detected in urine. genetic analysis of esbl-positive escherichia coli strains from icu patients revealed the ctx-m type of esbl production in most isolates.

TI  == orally administered colistin leads to colistin-resistant intestinal flora and fails to prevent faecal colonisation with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in hospitalised newborns.
AB  == colonisation and infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e) is an emerging problem. the aim of this study was to  investigate whether colistin, which is reported to be effective against multiresistant enterobacteria, prevents esbl-e colonisation in neonates. for prophylaxis of necrotising enterocolitis, oral gentamicin (15 mg/kg/day) is routinely used in all neonates hospitalised at the neonatal intensive care unit of university hospital graz (austria). during the study period from may 2005 to september 2007, three esbl-e outbreaks (total duration 18 months) occurred. during these outbreaks, gentamicin was immediately replaced by oral colistin (8 mg/kg/day) in all hospitalised neonates. all neonates colonised with esbl-e during the study period were retrospectively analysed with regard to the influence of colistin on esbl-e colonisation. genetic relatedness of isolates was assessed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr). during the study period, 30 (4.5%) of 667 neonates were colonised with esbl-e. twelve of twenty-one patients colonised with klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and one of nine patients colonised with klebsiella oxytoca (esbl-ko) had received oral colistin at time of colonisation with esbl-e. amongst esbl-kp, the rate of colistin resistance was significantly higher in the colistin group (p=0.0075). four different clones of esbl-kp and three different clones of esbl-ko were isolated, indicating the occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission. colistin-resistant as well as colistin-susceptible isolates were detected within  the same clones, indicating induction of resistance. at the dosage used, oral colistin did not prevent colonisation with esbl-e and appeared to select colistin-resistant strains or to induce colistin resistance.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in gram negative bacteria.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. infections due to esbl producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. derived from the older tem is derived from temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. in addition, esbl-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. at present, however, organizations such as the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) provide guidelines for the detection of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. in common to all esbl-detection  methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against esbl-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence  of clavulanic acid. carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to esbl-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. esbls represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the  face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.

TI  == chequerboard titration of cephalosporin cxa-101 (fr264205) and tazobactam versus  beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the developmental oxyimino-cephalosporin cxa-101 (fr264205) is notable for having greater antipseudomonal activity than ceftazidime. it is active against enterobacteriaceae too, but is compromised by extended-spectrum, ampc and carbapenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamases. we investigated the tazobactam concentrations needed to potentiate this cephalosporin against strains with these mechanisms. methods: mic chequerboards were prepared between cxa-101 and tazobactam (1-32 mg/l) using clsi agar dilution methodology and a challenge panel of 'difficult' enterobacteriaceae isolates. results: only 20% of 59 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers were susceptible to unprotected cxa-101 at 8 mg/l (5% at 2 mg/l), but 76% were susceptible to cxa-101 + tazobactam at 8 + 4 mg/l and 93% at 8 + 8 mg/l. among 20 ampc-derepressed organisms, three of four serratia spp. were susceptible to cxa-101 at 1-2 mg/l, but other species with the mechanism were more resistant; nevertheless, 70% were  susceptible to cxa-101 + tazobactam at 8 + 4 mg/l and 95% at 8 + 8 mg/l. the six  least-susceptible ampc-derepressed isolates were all enterobacter spp. the mics of cxa-101 for klebsiella oxytoca isolates hyperproducing k1 enzyme were 4 mg/l and were not significantly reduced by tazobactam: those for klebsiella pneumoniae with kpc enzymes were >or=128 mg/l and, in four out of five cases, were not significantly reduced by tazobactam. conclusions: tazobactam achieved concentration-dependent potentiation of cxa-101 versus esbl producers and ampc hyperproducers. if a breakpoint of 8 + 8 mg/l can be justified pharmacokinetically, cxa-101 + tazobactam should be active versus >90% of esbl producers, ampc hyperproducers and k1 hyperproducers. most isolates with kpc or other carbapenemases will remain resistant.

TI  == molecular analysis of type 3 fimbrial genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella and citrobacter species.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states and is caused by a range of uropathogens. biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause cauti is often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. in this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae from cauti strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri and citrobacter freundii. results: phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcd) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (a-e) ranging from one to twenty-three members. the majority of sequences grouped in clade a, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced k. pneumoniae mgh78578. the e. coli and k. pneumoniae mrkabcd gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. all of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkd-encoding adhesin gene.  type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation. conclusions: the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many gram-negative pathogens that cause cauti and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here by examining more strains as well  as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause cauti.

TI  == [detection of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == widespread production of ctx-m type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. consecutive 200 esbl producing enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between february to july 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. among the 200 esbl positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and proteus  mirabilis. esbl positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). the prevalence of bla(ctx-m) beta-lactamase genes were  detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: ctx-ma1 and ctx-ma2 primers for the amplification of ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 and ctx-m-9 enzymes group, and ctx825-f and ctx825-r primers for the amplification of ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-25 enzymes group. bla(ctx-m) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). ctx-m production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no  statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). ctx-m producing strains were either e. coli (n = 132) or klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from ctx-m-1, ctx-m-2 or ctx-m-9 groups. no strains carrying ctx-m-8 or ctx-m-25 group enzymes were detected. ctx-m production rates  in esbl producing e. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for esbl producing klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. the difference between the ctx-m production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, ctx-m prevalence was found high in esbl producing strains of both e. coli and klebsiella spp. since bla(ctx-m) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for ctx-m type esbl production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.

TI  == susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to tigecycline and other selected antibiotics.
AB  == background: tigecycline is a new glycylcycline with broad-spectrum activity. among these new agents, tigecycline is unique in generally having good activity against gram-negative bacteria. tigecycline has been approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and skin structure infections. tigecycline had good activity against most esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and may be a therapeutic alternative to carbapenems in some infections caused by esbl-producing isolates, many of which are also multiresistant to quinolones, aminoglycosides, and classical tetracyclines. material/methods: one hundred and eight clinical isolates of klebsiella spp. (64  k. pneumoniae and 44 k. oxytoca) were included. the susceptibility to selected antibiotics was tested by the disk-diffusion method. tigecycline's mic was determined by the etest. results: of all the analyzed klebsiella spp. strains, 31 (28.7%) produced esbls. most of the klebsiella spp. strains were susceptible to imipenem (100%), tigecycline (92.5%), and the combination of piperacilline and tazobactam (80.6%). tigecycline exhibited high activity against klebsiella strains, with mics ranging from 0.19 to 4 microg/ml. conclusions: tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against the analyzed strains. these data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by klebsiella strains.

TI  == potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in egypt.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. the samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the sharkia governorate of egypt. air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). the results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), s. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), s. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), escherichia  coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), k. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), p. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), p. vulgaris  (3.3% vs 6.7%), pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of aspergillus fumigatus (46.7%  vs 63.3%), a. niger (20% vs 36.7%), a. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), p. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), p. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. in addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed  heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. the results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == comparison of the efficacy of rose bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers rose bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (led) on enterobacteriaceae. twelve enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three escherichia coli, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella oxytoca and three  klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. an enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: led and rose bengal, led and erythrosin, led and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. a blue led unit (460 nm), and rose bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (cfu) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (anova). the enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal. there was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for escherichia coli, 6.76 log10  for klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for klebsiella oxytoca. however, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of cfus per milliliter compared to the control group. the use of the led alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. the enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == use of automated repetitive-sequence-based pcr for rapid laboratory confirmation  of nosocomial outbreaks.
AB  == objective: rapid and reliable diagnosis of genetic relatedness of clinical isolates in microbiologic laboratory is essential in case of nosocomial outbreak  investigation. most molecular techniques used to type microorganisms are technically demanding and time consuming. currently repetitive-sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) technique has been adapted to an automated format on the diversilab system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). aim of this study was to compare the performance of the diversilab system to that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge) in nosocomial outbreaks. methods: 122 clinical isolates (28 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 26 acinetobacter baumannii, 45 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca) were investigated. 70 isolates originated from six well-documented outbreaks, 52 were non-outbreak isolates. results: concordant results for identification of outbreak and non-outbreak mrsa, a. baumannii and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains were achieved with both methods. in the outbreak of esbl-producing k. oxytoca automated rep-pcr was slightly more discriminatory than pfge. rep-pcr identified investigated esbl-producing k. oxytoca outbreak-strains as indistinguishable or closely related, showing similarity of >90%, while pfge identified these strains as indistinguishable. conclusion: automated rep-pcr assays on the diversilab system were used for mrsa, a. baumannii and for the first time esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and proved as  a rapid and reliable method for molecular analysis of nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == [resistance to fluoroquinolone among klebsiella spp strains producing extended-spectrum betalactamases isolated from urine].
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls) klebsiella spp isolated from urines of consulting and hospitalized patients in rabat specialities hospital. a retrospective survey was made over 3 years (2006-2008).  two hundred ant fifty three patients presented with confirmed urinary tractus infection (uti). klebsiella spp was the etiologic agent in 28% (72/253) of reported uti. among them, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae and 14% of klebsiella oxytoca. the frequency of klebsiella spp resistance to fluoroquinolones was 33% and to third generation cephalosporins was 35%. thirteen klebsiella spp strains were producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase witch corresponds to 18% of all the klebsiella. the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains with resistance to fluoroquinolones were 85% (11/13) or 15 % of all klebsiella (11/72). none of those strains was resistant to imipenem. in conclusions resistance of enterobacteries such as klebsiella spp to fluoroquinolones is becoming worrying among consulting and hospitalized patients. eleven strains multiresistant (esbl + resistance to fluoroquinolones), isolated probably because of plasmids carrying genes of esbl and fluoroquinolones resistances. this increasingly frequent resistance mechanism should lead to a more careful use of first line fluoroquinolones for uti.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in brazil.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. in this study, 127 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at sao paulo, brazil, were submitted to analysis by pcr  with specific primers for bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m genes. from the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%)  morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) enterobacter cloacae were identified as esbl producers. bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of k. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. pcr results showed a high variety of esbl groups among strains, in nine different species. the results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.

TI  == use of boronic acid disk tests to detect extended- spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of kpc carbapenemase-possessing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == we evaluated boronic acid (ba)-based methods for their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among clinical isolates of kpc-producing members of the enterobacteriaceae family. a total of 155 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 141), escherichia coli (n = 6), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 6), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) genotypically confirmed to be kpc producers were analyzed. as many as 118 isolates harbored esbls (103 harbored shv-type esbls, 13 harbored ctx-m-type esbls, and 2 harbored both shv- and ctx-m-type esbls); the remaining 37 isolates were genotypically negative for esbl production. the clsi esbl confirmatory test was positive for 79 of the 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 66.9%), while all 37 non-esbl producers were negative (specificity, 100%). when a > or =5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (ctx)-clavulanate (ca) or the ceftazidime (caz)-ca disks containing ba compared with the zone diameter of the ctx or caz disks containing  ba was considered to be a positive result for esbl production, the method detected all 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 100%) and showed no false-positive  results for non-esbl producers (specificity, 100%). double-disk synergy tests, in which disks of ctx, caz, aztreonam, or cefepime in combination with ba were placed at distances of 20, 25, and 30 mm (center to center) from a disk containing amoxicillin (amoxicilline)-clavulanate-ba, were able to detect 116 (98.3%), 101 (85.6%), and 28 (23.7%) of the esbl-positive isolates, respectively; no false-positive results for non-esbl-producing isolates were detected. our results demonstrate that the modified clsi esbl confirmatory test with antibiotic disks containing ba is the most accurate phenotypic method for the detection of esbls in enterobacteriaceae producing kpc carbapenemases.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == [typing of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains and analysis of plasmid profiles].
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify the types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) produced by 12 escherichia coli and 32 klebsiella spp. (28 k. pneumoniae, 4 k. oxytoca) strains isolated from various specimens (urine, blood, tracheal aspirate, abscess, throat, drain/catheter tips, pleural/peritoneal fluids, cerebrospinal fluid, eye) of patients hospitalized in  different units (intensive care, hematology, oncology neonatology, transplantation, pediatric surgery) of istanbul medical faculty hospital, turkey. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by disc diffusion according to  nccls (clsi) guidelines and no resistance to imipenem or meropenem was detected.  mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime were determined by agar dilution method and mic50 and mic90 for cefotaxime were found as 16 microg/ml and 64 microg/ml in both klebsiella spp. and e. coli strains, respectively. the presence of esbl was  confirmed by double-disc synergy testing and e-test esbl. all isolates demonstrated an esbl phenotype by these two methods. isoelectric focusing (ief) method demonstrated that the isolates produced 1-4 different beta-lactamases (pls: 5.4-9.0). the rates of tem, shv, ctx-m beta-lactamases detected by using specific primers in polymerase chain reaction (pcr), were found as 64.3%, 92.9%,  64.3% for k. pneumoniae and 66.7%, 25%, 83.3%, for e.coli strains, respectively.  the profiles generated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr using eric-2 primer revealed several bands, ranging in size from 170 to 1500 bp. according to rapd-pcr results, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and e. coli strains were separated to 10, 3 and 6 groups, respectively. in the conjugation experiments, 31 of the isolates (70.4%) transferred their resistance genes to recipient e. coli strain. plasmid analysis studies showed that resistance genes were carried on a single plasmid (> 48 kb) in 20 transconjugants (64.5%), while the rest of the strains (35.5%) harbored more than one plasmid, with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 kb. these results showed the rapid emergence and high prevalence of ctx-m type enzymes among klebsiella spp. and e. coli strains in our hospital.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae? an evaluation of the vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in kuwait.
AB  == background and aims: clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting esbl bacteria. this study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect esbl bacteria, and compared the vitek system with other detection systems. methods: (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, k oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as esbl-positive by the vitek 2 system. the isolates were retested by the vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (ddd), the disc approximation test, the e-test and the microscan system for the detection of esbls. results: retesting with the vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source  hospitals. the microscan system, ddd, disc approximation test and e-test could detect esbl in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. conclusions: technically, the microscan and vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect esbl as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. e-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. the ddd test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. the vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of esbl bacteria.

AB  == background: accurate and rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is important in guiding proper antimicrobial therapy for infected patients. we evaluated the performance of microscan negcombo type 44 panel (dade  behring, usa), which was developed to confirm esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae using ceftazidime/clavulanate and cefotaxime/clavulanate. methods: from august 30 to september 20, 2007, 206 non-duplicate clinical isolates, including 106 escherichia coli, 81 klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 klebsiella oxytoca, and 8 proteus  mirabilis were subcultured and tested with type 32 and type 44 panels. the results were compared with those of the clsi phenotypic confirmatory test (clsi-pct) and disk approximation test (dat). isolates not susceptible to cefotetan or flagged as "possible esbl, unable to interpret confirm test (possible esbl)" on type 44 panel were tested with boronic acid disks to confirm  ampc beta-lactamases (ampc) production. results: of the 206 isolates tested, 44 (21.4%) produced esbl by clsi-pct or dat, including 27 e. coli, 14 k. pneumoniae, 2 k. oxytoca, and 1 p. mirabilis. thirty-eight isolates flagged as "confirmed esbl" on type 44 panel were all confirmed as esbl-producers. of 14 k. pneumoniae  flagged as "possible esbl", 6 were confirmed as esbl and ampc co-producers and 8  as ampc-producers. conclusions: type 44 panel showed an excellent performance in  detecting esbl-producing e. coli, klebsiella spp., and p. mirabilis. when flagged as "confirmed esbl", no other confirmatory test was necessary to report as esbl;  however, "possible esbl" required a differential test for ampc production.

TI  == genetic organization of transposase regions surrounding blakpc carbapenemase genes on plasmids from klebsiella strains isolated in a new york city hospital.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains carrying klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpc) are endemic to new york city and are spreading across the united states and internationally. recent studies have indicated that the kpc structural gene is located on a 10-kb plasmid-borne element designated tn4401. fourteen klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one klebsiella oxytoca strain isolated at a new york city hospital in 2005 carrying either bla(kpc-2) or bla(kpc-3) were examined for isoforms of tn4401. ten of the klebsiella strains contained a 100-bp deletion in tn4401, corresponding to the tn4401a isoform. the presence of this deletion adjacent to the upstream promoter region of bla(kpc) in tn4401a resulted in a different -35 promoter sequence of tggaga than that of ctgatt present in isoform tn4401b. complete sequencing of one plasmid carrying bla(kpc) from each of three nonclonal isolates indicated the presence of genes encoding other types  of antibiotic resistance determinants. the 70.6-kb plasmid from k. pneumoniae strain s9 carrying bla(kpc-2) revealed two identical copies of tn4401b inserted in an inverse fashion, but in this case, one of the elements disrupted a group ii self-splicing intron. in k. pneumoniae strain s15, the tn4401a element carrying bla(kpc-2) was found on both a large 120-kb plasmid and a smaller 24-kb plasmid.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results indicate that the isolates studied represent a heterogeneous group composed of unrelated as well as closely related  klebsiella strains. our results suggest that endemic kpc-positive klebsiella strains constitute a generally nonclonal population comprised of various alleles  of bla(kpc) on several distinct plasmid genetic backgrounds. this study increases our understanding of the genetic composition of the evolving and expanding role of kpc-producing, healthcare-associated, gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == molecular identification of ctx-m and blaoxy/k1 beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae by sequencing of universal m13-sequence tagged pcr-amplicons.
AB  == background: plasmid encoded blactx-m enzymes represent an important sub-group of  class a beta-lactamases causing the esbl phenotype which is increasingly found in enterobacteriaceae including klebsiella spp. molecular typing of clinical esbl-isolates has become more and more important for prevention of the dissemination of esbl-producers among nosocomial environment. methods: multiple displacement amplified dna derived from 20 k. pneumoniae and 34 k. oxytoca clinical isolates with an esbl-phenotype was used in a universal ctx-m pcr amplification assay. identification and differentiation of blactx-m and blaoxy/k1 sequences was obtained by dna sequencing of m13-sequence-tagged ctx-m pcr-amplicons using a m13-specific sequencing primer. results: nine out of 20 k.  pneumoniae clinical isolates had a blactx-m genotype. interestingly, we found that the universal degenerated primers also amplified the chromosomally located k1-gene in all 34 k. oxytoca clinical isolates. molecular identification and differentiation between blactx-m and blaoxy/k1-genes could only been achieved by  sequencing of the pcr-amplicons. in silico analysis revealed that the universal degenerated ctx-m primer-pair used here might also amplify the chromosomally located blaoxy and k1-genes in klebsiella spp. and k1-like genes in other enterobacteriaceae. conclusion: the pcr-based molecular typing method described here enables a rapid and reliable molecular identification of blactx-m, and blaoxy/k1-genes. the principles used in this study could also be applied to any situation in which antimicrobial resistance genes would need to be sequenced.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing pathogens in a children's hospital: a  5-year experience.
AB  == background: pediatric infection with bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) has not been well described. we sought to determine the proportion of isolates producing esbls and the incidence of infection or colonization with these organisms in our tertiary care pediatric facility over 5  years. in addition, we sought to evaluate the characteristics of children affected. methods: we identified all escherichia coli or klebsiella spp cultured  from children younger than 18 years of age at our facility between january 2003 and december 2007. medical records were reviewed for affected children. results:  of 2697 e coli, k pneumoniae, and k oxytoca cultured, 26 esbl producers were isolated from 16 children. rates of esbl production among cultured isolates significantly increased, from 0.53% in the first half of the study period to 1.4% in the second. incidence of a primary esbl infection also increased significantly, from 0.14/10,000 patient encounters to 0.31/10,000. the majority of children infected or colonized with esbl-producing organisms were those with chronic medical conditions, frequent hospitalizations, or a history of recurrent  infection. however, 4 affected children were less than 5 months old and evaluated in an outpatient setting. conclusion: rates and incidence of esbl infection increased over the study period. whereas most patients belonged to traditional risk groups for antibiotic-resistant infection, infants in the ambulatory setting were also affected, an at-risk population not previously described.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains isolated from urinary tract infections in a private hospital].
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the antibiotic resistance rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. strains isolated from urinary tract infections (utis) in private acibadem hospital, istanbul, turkey. a total of 1100 e. coli and 356 klebsiella spp. strains isolated from 17.028 urine cultures which were processed between october  2006 and august 2007 in the clinical laboratory, were included to the study. identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by  phoenix (becton dickinson, usa) automated system. of e. coli strains 12% (n= 132) were found positive for esbl, while this rate was 12% (n= 41) for klebsiella spp. strains (38 k.pneumoniae, 3 k. oxytoca). the resistance rates of esbl producing e. coli and klebsiello spp. strains were found as follows respectively; 3% and 2.4% for amikacin, 3% and 85.4% for nitrofurantoin, 0% and 4.9% for fosfomycin, 5.3% and 100% for cefoxitin, 21.2% and 58.5% for piperacilin/tazobactam, 34.8% and 41.5% for gentamicin, 68.9% and 58% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), 75.9% and 56.1% for tobramycin, 80.3% and 21.9% for ciprofloxacin and  norfloxacin. all of the esbl positive e. coli and klebsiella spp. strains were resistant to ampicilin, aztreonam, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone  and cefuroxime-sodium; while all of the esbl positive e. coli and klebsiella spp. strains were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. the rates of resistance obtained in this study were higher than the rates obtained in other studies performed in our country. this could be attributed to the different antibiotic use policies of different centers or to more frequent use of antibiotics by the patients applied to private hospitals, owing to their higher socioeconomical status and easier attainment of antibiotics without prescription.

TI  == nationwide surveillance in taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tigecycline in-vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. this study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of  resistant gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and etest  methods. a total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 275) with mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 324) with mic(90) 2 microg/ml and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing proteus mirabilis (n = 15) the mic(90) was 4 microg/ml with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8) the mic(50) and mic(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against esbl- producing k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca.

TI  == development and evaluation of a real-time pcr assay for detection of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase genes.
AB  == we developed a novel real-time pcr assay to detect klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and used this assay to screen clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca for the presence of bla(kpc) genes. the taqman  real-time pcr assay amplified a 399-bp product from the bla(kpc) gene. the amplicon was designed so that the genes for isoenzymes kpc-1, -2, and -3 could be easily distinguished by subsequent restriction digestion of the amplicon with the enzymes bstni and rsai. the assay was validated with reference strains obtained from the centers for disease control and prevention that contained each of the three described isoenzymes and 69 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates (39 k. pneumoniae and 30 k. oxytoca isolates). subsequently, the bla(kpc) pcr assay was used to confirm the presence of bla(kpc) genes in any  meropenem-resistant klebsiella spp. the pcr assay detected bla(kpc) in all of the reference strains, in 6 of 7 meropenem-resistant isolates, and in 0 of 62 meropenem-susceptible clinical isolates. the pcr assay was then used to confirm the presence of bla(kpc) in an additional 20 meropenem-resistant isolates from 16 patients. restriction digestion of the pcr amplicons identified two bla(kpc) gene variants in our patient population: 9 isolates with c and 17 with t at nucleotide 944, consistent with bla(kpc-2) and bla(kpc-3), respectively. the real-time pcr assay is a rapid and accurate method to detect all kpc isoenzymes and was useful  in documenting the presence and dissemination of kpc-producing strains in our patient population.

AB  == the cellular localization of a chimera formed by fusing a monomeric red fluorescent protein to the c terminus of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system outer membrane secretin puld (puld-mcherry) in escherichia coli was determined in vivo by fluorescence microscopy. like puld, puld-mcherry formed sodium dodecyl sulfate- and heat-resistant multimers and was functional in pullulanase secretion. chromosome-encoded puld-mcherry formed fluorescent foci on the periphery of the cell in the presence of high (plasmid-encoded) levels of its cognate chaperone, the pilotin puls. subcellular fractionation demonstrated that  the chimera was located exclusively in the outer membrane under these circumstances. a similar localization pattern was observed by fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells treated with green fluorescent protein-tagged affitin,  which binds with high affinity to an epitope in the n-terminal region of puld. at lower levels of (chromosome-encoded) puls, puld-mcherry was less stable, was located mainly in the inner membrane, from which it could not be solubilized with urea, and did not induce the phage shock response, unlike puld in the absence of  puls. the fluorescence pattern of puld-mcherry under these conditions was similar to that observed when puls levels were high. the complete absence of puls caused  the appearance of bright and almost exclusively polar fluorescent foci.

TI  == cleanliness scores as indicator of klebsiella exposure in dairy cows.
AB  == this study was designed to explore the relationship between cow and udder cleanliness scores and the risk of isolation of klebsiella spp. from lower hind legs and teat ends, respectively. the distribution of klebsiella species was compared among isolates from teat ends, legs, and cases of clinical mastitis obtained from 2 dairy farms in new york state, with 850 and 1,000 cows, respectively. farms were visited twice approximately 4 wk apart in august and september 2007 to obtain cleanliness scores and swabs from legs and teats. isolates of klebsiella clinical mastitis from each farm were collected from july  through october 2007. two studies were conducted. in the first study, whole-cow cleanliness of a purposive sample of 200 lactating cows was scored using a 4-point scale, and swabs were taken from their lower hind legs. in the second study, udder cleanliness of a separate convenience sample of 199 lactating cows was scored in the milking parlor, and swabs were taken from their teat ends before and after premilking udder preparation. prevalence of klebsiella spp. on legs and teat ends before udder preparation was 59 and 60%, respectively. logistic regression was used to explore the association between isolation of klebsiella spp. and cleanliness scores. cow cleanliness scores and udder cleanliness scores were not associated with detection of klebsiella on legs and on teats before udder preparation, respectively. after udder preparation, 43% of  previously klebsiella positive teat end samples remained positive, with significant differences between farms and months. teats from dirty udders were significantly more likely to test positive for klebsiella after udder preparation than teats from clean udders. the proportion of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates was similar for isolates from teat end swabs and clinical mastitis cases, supporting the notion that the presence of klebsiella on teat ends may lead to opportunistic intramammary infections. udder cleanliness scores could be used as a management tool to monitor the risk of exposure to klebsiella spp. on teat ends.

TI  == direct comparison of the bd phoenix system with the microscan walkaway system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostics, sparks, md) is designed for the rapid identification (id) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of clinically significant human bacterial pathogens. we evaluated the performance of the phoenix instrument in comparison with that of the microscan walkaway system (dade behring, west sacramento, ca) in the id and ast of gram-negative clinical strains and challenge isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 150) and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb; 45 clinical isolates and 8 challenge isolates). id discrepancies were resolved with the api 20e and api 20ne conventional biochemical id systems (biomerieux, durham, nc). the standard disk diffusion method was used to resolve discordant ast results. the overall percentages of agreement between the phoenix id results and the microscan results at the genus and species levels for clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae were  98.7 and 97.7%, respectively; following resolution with conventional biochemical  testing, the accuracy of the phoenix system was determined to be 100%. for nfgnb, the levels of agreement were 100 and 97.7%, respectively. both systems incorrectly identified the majority of the uncommon nonfermentative nonpseudomonal challenge isolates recovered from cystic fibrosis patients; these  isolates are not included in the databases of the respective systems. for ast of  enterobacteriaceae, the rate of complete agreement between the phoenix results and the microscan results was 97%; the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0.3, 0.2, and 2.7%, respectively. for nfgnb, the rate of complete agreement between the phoenix results and the microscan results was 89.1%; the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 0.5, and 7.7%, respectively. following the confirmatory testing of nine clinical isolates initially screened by the microscan system as possible extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms (seven klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and two escherichia coli isolates), complete agreement was achieved for eight isolates (one esbl positive and seven negative); one false positive was obtained with the  phoenix instrument. the microscan system correctly detected the 10 esbl challenge isolates, versus the 6 detected by the phoenix system. overall, there was good correlation between the phoenix instrument and the microscan system for the id and ast of enterobacteriaceae and common nfgnb. the phoenix system is a reliable  method for the id and ast of the majority of clinical strains encountered in the  clinical microbiology laboratory. until additional performance data are available, results for all klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca and e. coli isolates screened and confirmed as esbl producers by any automated system should be confirmed by alternate methods prior to the release of final results.

AB  == background: the dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to mbl-producing isolates were analyzed. methods: during a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an mbl-producing strain  belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. we screened for mbl production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. results: fourteen cases of bacteremia and  3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an mbl-producing isolate were studied. most of the patients had previously been colonized with an mbl-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. the isolated pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/ml) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(vim-1) cluster in all isolates. among the 12 k. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have  failed. twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. the attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. conclusions: mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the mic of carbapenems. colonization with an mbl-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.

AB  == objectives: twenty-four of 209 oxyimino-cephalosporin- and/or aztreonam-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected around bolzano had reduced susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems and gave positive metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) tests. their resistance mechanisms were investigated. methods: resistances were identified by vitek 2 and mic tests and isolates were genotyped by pfge. resistance genes were identified by pcr and sequencing, and plasmids were transferred by conjugation and/or transformation. plasmid-borne genes were identified by southern blotting, and their genetic surroundings were investigated by pcr mapping. results: the 24 isolates with positive edta/imipenem synergy tests had bla(vim-1) carried on 40-150 kb plasmids. imipenem mics ranged from 2 to >32 mg/l, while those of meropenem and ertapenem were lower. the isolates included a clonal cluster of 10 klebsiella pneumoniae, two other k. pneumoniae isolates, and diverse isolates of escherichia coli (seven), klebsiella oxytoca (three) and citrobacter freundii (two). six mbl producers were aztreonam-susceptible; the 18 aztreonam-resistant isolates had co-resident extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. bla(vim-1) occurred as the first cassette in class 1 integrons, with aaca4 as the second cassette. quinolone resistance gene qnrs1 was detected in 21 of 24 (87.5%) bla(vim-1)-positive isolates versus 14 of  185 (7.6%) bla(vim)-negative isolates (p < 0.0001), with 13 of the latter belonging to a clonal cluster of e. coli. qnrs1 was located on the same plasmids  as bla(vim-1) and aaca4, but was not closely linked, as judged by pcr mapping. conclusions: bla(vim-1) has become disseminated among enterobacteria in a small italian town. the frequent association of genes conferring carbapenem, aminoglycoside and quinolone resistance on single plasmids will facilitate co-selection.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in nosocomial bacteremia isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca at hacettepe university adult hospital in ankara, turkey. a total of 344 blood culture isolates of e. coli (n=244), k. pneumoniae (n=86) and k. oxytoca (n=34) were included in the study from january 2003 to november 2005. only one isolate from one patient was tested  in the study. the isolates with ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime mic values > or =1  microg/ml were tested by ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid and cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid etest (ab biodisk solna, sweden) strips and evaluated as esbl positive if the ratio was > or =8. of the isolates, 33% (74/224) of e. coli, 31.4% (27/86) of k. pneumoniae and 47% (16/34) of k. oxytoca were detected as esbl producers by any kind of two strips. however, 5.4% (4/74) of e. coli, 3.7% (1/27) of k. pneumoniae and 43.1% (7/16) of k. oxytoca esbl-producing isolates could be detected only by cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid strips. it is important to use cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid as well as ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid ratio for detection of esbl types that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime. since prevalence of esbl production is high  in nosocomial e. coli and klebsiella spp. isolates in our hospital, surveillance  of antibiotic susceptibility patterns is important for the empirical treatment of bacteremic patients.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in the united arab emirates.
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae among patients in the united arab emirates. materials and methods: a total of 130 enterobacteriaceae comprising of escherichia coli (n = 83), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 45) and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) was studied. of these 130 isolates, 64 were from urine. esbl screening was by disc diffusion and confirmatory tests for  esbl phenotype were conducted using bd phoenix esbl system and cephalosporin/clavulanate combination discs. susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was evaluated. results: of the 130 isolates, 53 (41%) were identified as having esbl phenotype; of these, 32 (60%) were e. coli, 20 (36%) k. pneumoniae and 2 (4%) k. oxytoca. esbl phenotype was seen in 100% of endotracheal tubes isolates, 20 (31%) from urine, 7 (58%) from blood and 4 (80%) from catheter tips. amikacin susceptibility was 100%. over 90% of esbl isolates showed resistance to  aztreonam and cephalosporins. all klebsiella isolates were carbapenem sensitive.  one esbl isolate showed intermediate resistance to imipenem and meropenem (both mic 8 microg/ml), cefotetan (mic 32 microg/ml) and piperacillin/tazobactam (mic 32 microg/ml). mic for the carbapenems was lower in non-esbl isolates (0.034 microg/ml) than esbl isolates (0.071 microg/ml). resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was higher in esbl than non-esbl isolates (p < 0.05). conclusion: a high prevalence of esbl-producing bacteria exists among in-patients in the united arab emirates. amikacin and carbapenems remain the most effective drugs, but the presence of carbapenem-resistant esbl-producing e. coli and occurrence of multidrug resistance are of concern. continued surveillance and judicious antibiotic usage are recommended.

TI  == identification of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic escherichia coli reveals a role in biofilm formation.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states. uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), the most common cause of cauti, can form biofilms on indwelling catheters. here, we identify and characterize novel factors that affect biofilm formation by upec strains that cause cauti. sixty-five cauti upec isolates were characterized for phenotypic markers of urovirulence, including agglutination and biofilm formation. one isolate, e. coli ms2027, was uniquely proficient at biofilm growth despite the absence of adhesins known to promote this phenotype. mini-tn5 mutagenesis of e. coli ms2027 identified several mutants with altered biofilm growth. mutants containing insertions in genes involved in o antigen synthesis (rmlc and manb) and capsule synthesis (kpsm) possessed enhanced biofilm phenotypes. three independent mutants deficient in biofilm growth contained an insertion in a gene locus homologous to the type 3 chaperone-usher class fimbrial genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. these type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcdf), which were located on a conjugative plasmid, were cloned from e. coli ms2027 and could  complement the biofilm-deficient transconjugants when reintroduced on a plasmid.  primers targeting the mrkb chaperone-encoding gene revealed its presence in cauti strains of citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. all of these mrkb-positive strains caused type 3 fimbria-specific agglutination of tannic acid-treated red blood cells. this is the first description of type 3 fimbriae in e. coli, c. koseri, and c. freundii.  our data suggest that type 3 fimbriae may contribute to biofilm formation by different gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == application of pcr ribotyping and tdna-pcr for klebsiella pneumoniae identification.
AB  == pcr analysis of 16s-23s internal transcribed spacer (pcr ribotyping) and trna intergenic spacer (tdna-pcr) were evaluated for their effectiveness in identification of clinical strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and differentiation with related species. for this purpose both methods were applied to forty-three clinical isolates biochemically identified as k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae isolated from patients clinical specimens attended at five hospitals in three brazilian cities. references strains of k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and enterobacter aerogenes were also analyzed. both pcr methods showed specific patterns for each species. a conserved pcr ribotype pattern was observed for all clinical k. pneumoniae isolates, while differing from other related analyzed species. tdna-pcr revealed  five distinct patterns among the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates studied, demonstrating a predominant group with 90.6% of isolates presenting the same pattern of k. pneumoniae type strain. both pcr-based methods were not able to differentiate k. pneumoniae subspecies. on the basis of the results obtained, both methods were efficient to differentiate the klebsiella species analyzed, as  well as e. aerogenes. meanwhile tdna-pcr revealed different trna arrangements in  k. pneumoniae, suggesting intra-species heterogeneity of their genome organization, the polymorphism of the intergenic spacers between 16s and 23s rrna genes appears to be highly conserved whithin k. pneumoniae clinical isolates, showing that pcr ribotyping can be an useful tool for identification of k. pneumoniae isolates.

TI  == complex clonal and plasmid epidemiology in the first outbreak of enterobacteriaceae infection involving vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in spain: toward endemicity?
AB  == background: we report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls)  among enterobacterial isolates at ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain). methods and results: during the period from march 2005 through september  2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients;  escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). clonal analysis (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all k. pneumoniae  isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the e. cloacae isolates. carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/ml), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. the bla(vim-1) mbl gene was present in all isolates; in addition,  the bla(shv-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dfrii-aada1-catb2) in k. pneumoniae and e. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) in e. cloacae and  k. oxytoca isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 k. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 e. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 e. coli isolate. a 60-kb plasmid belonging to the inci1 group was detected in the epidemic vim-1-k. pneumoniae clone. plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to inch12 group were found among e. cloacae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae-mbl monoclonal epidemics coexisted with e. cloacae-mbl multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. the spread of the bla(vim-1) gene among enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class i integron platforms. such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.

TI  == dry stress and survival time of enterobacter sakazakii and other enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  == powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. in this study, the generation of sublethally injured enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. the study included 27 strains of enterobacter  sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella enteritidis, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, escherichia vulneris, pantoea spp., klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of sublethally injured  cells generated during desiccation was lower for k. oxytoca, pantoea spp., salmonella enteritidis, and capsulated strains of e. sakazakii than for the other enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. c. freundii, c. koseri, and e. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and salmonella  enteritidis, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. pantoea spp., k. oxytoca, and e. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of e. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.

TI  == construction and characterization of hybrid dehydratases between adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol and glycerol dehydratases.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase are isofunctional enzymes that catalyze the dehydration of 1,2-diols to the corresponding aldehydes. although they bear different metabolic roles, both enzymes consist of three different subunits and possess a common (alphabetagamma)2 structure. to elucidate the roles of each subunit, we constructed expression plasmids for the hybrid dehydratases between diol dehydratase of klebsiella oxytoca and glycerol dehydratase of klebsiella pneumoniae in all the combinations of subunits by gene engineering techniques. all of the hybrid enzymes were produced in escherichia coli at high levels, but only two hybrid enzymes consisting of the alpha subunit from glycerol dehydratase and the beta subunits from diol dehydratase showed high activity. the substrate specificity, the susceptibility to inactivation by glycerol, and the monovalent cation specificity of the wild type and hybrid enzymes were primarily determined  by the origin of their alpha subunits.

TI  == comparison of phoenix and vitek 2 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase detection tests for analysis of escherichia coli and klebsiella isolates with well-characterized beta-lactamases.
AB  == the vitek 2 and phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection systems, which comprise confirmatory tests and expert systems, were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between 102 well-characterized strains of esbl-positive or -negative escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. at least 38 distinct esbls were included. the strains were chosen to include some known to cause false-positive and false-negative clsi esbl confirmatory test results. therefore, enzyme characterizations, rather than clsi  tests, were the reference methods for the phoenix and vitek 2 evaluations. a third arm of the study was conducted with the phoenix test using two normally inactive expert rules intended to enhance esbl detection, in addition to using the currently available software. the phoenix esbl confirmatory test and unmodified expert system exhibited 96% sensitivity and 81% specificity for esbl detection. activation of the two additional rules increased sensitivity to 99% but reduced the specificity to 58%. the vitek 2 esbl confirmatory test exhibited  91% sensitivity, which was reduced to 89% sensitivity by its expert system, while its specificity was 85%. many of the expert system interpretations of both instruments were helpful, but some were suboptimal. the vitek 2 expert system was potentially more frustrating because it provided more inconclusive interpretations of the results. considering the high degree of diagnostic difficulty posed by the strains, both esbl confirmatory tests were highly sensitive. the expert systems of both instruments require modification to update  and enhance their utility.

AB  == kpp95, isolated on klebsiella pneumoniae, is a bacteriophage with the morphology  of t4-type phages and is capable of rapid lysis of host cells. its double-stranded genomic dna (ca. 175 kb, estimated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) can be cut only by restriction endonucleases with a cleavage site flanked either by a and t or by t, as tested, suggesting that it contains the modified derivative(s) of g and/or c. over 26 protein bands were visualized upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins. n-terminal sequencing indicated that the most abundant band (46 kda) is the major coat protein (gp23) which has been cleaved from a signal peptide likely with a length similar to that of t4. phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the central region (263 amino acid residues) of gp23 and the full length of gp18 and gp19 placed kpp95 among the pseudo-t-even subgroup, most closely related to the coliphage js98. in addition to being able to lyse many extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains of k. pneumoniae, kpp95 can lyse klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter agglomerans, and serratia marcescens cells. thus, kpp95 deserves further studies for development as a component of a therapeutic cocktail, owing to its high efficiencies of host lysis plus extended host range.

AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == characterization of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from new zealand sea lion (phocarctos hookeri) pups during and after the epidemics on enderby island, auckland islands.
AB  == the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 breeding seasons of new zealand sea lions (nzsls) on  the auckland islands were marked by a high pup mortality caused by acute bacterial infections. as part of a health survey from 1998/1999 to 2004/2005, tissues and swabs of lesions had been collected at necropsy to identify the bacteria associated with pup mortality. klebsiella pneumoniae was grown in pure culture from 83% of various organs and lesions in 2001/2002 and 76% in 2002/2003, and less frequently in the following seasons (56% in 2003/2004 and 49% in 2004/2005). pup isolates of k. pneumoniae showed identical minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cefuroxime, neomycin, cephalotin, cephalexin and dihydrostreptomycin, suggesting clonal aetiology of the pathogen. isolates also tested negative for production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), which was not in favour of an anthropogenetic origin of the epidemic strain. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of xbai dna macrorestriction fragments was performed on isolates of k. pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca from 35 pups, thee nzsl adult females, and from three human patients for comparison. pfge showed that pup isolates of k. pneumoniae were genetically indistinguishable but  were neither related to k. pneumoniae from humans and from nzsl adults, nor to k. oxytoca from nzsls. it is concluded that the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 epidemics at sandy bay rookery were caused by a single k. pneumoniae clonal lineage, genetically different from the strain carried by adult nzsls. an anthropogenic origin of the k. pneumoniae clone could not be confirmed, but further investigations are required to rule-out such occurrence.

TI  == [hydrolytic and haemolytic activity of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca].
AB  == hydrolytic enzymes and haemolysins are important extracellular substances produced by many bacteria. we investigated 57 k. pneumoniae strains and 40 k. oxytoca strains isolated from clinical materials. we estimated the ability to produce: proteases hydrolyzing milk powder, caseinase, gelatinase, elastase, lecithinase, lipases, dnase and haemolysins on human, sheep and horse erythrocytes on tsa medium with or without 5% egg yolk. we detected that k. oxytoca strains produced proteases hydrolyzing milk powder (37.5%), caseinase (15.0%) and gelatinase (17.5%) more frequently than k. pneumoniae strains (respectively 21.0%, 5.3%, 8.9%). none of the analysed klebsiella spp. strains produced elastase. only k. pneumoniae strains produced lecithinase (5.3%). lipases hydrolyzing tween were produced from 3.5% (for tween 60 and 80) to 7.0% (for tween 20). among k. oxytoca strains only one (2.5%) hydrolyzing tween 20. dnase was produced by 38.6% of k. pneumoniae strains and by 27.5% k. oxytoca strains. haemolytic properties on human erythrocytes were detected in 5.3% k. pneumoniae strains on tsa medium and 29,8% on medium with egg yolk. in k. oxytoca strains haemolytic properties on human erythrocytes were detected only on medium  with egg yolk (12.5%). haemolytic properties on sheep erythrocytes were detected  respectively in 21.0% and 22.8% k. pneumoniae strains and in 7.5% k. oxytoca strains on each medium. haemolytic properties on horse erythrocytes were detected respectively in 33.4% and 52.6% k. pneumoniae strains and in 15.0% and 20.0% k. oxytoca strains.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == [development of beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteria].
AB  == enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, beta-lactamases of class a: tem and shv (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). these can give rise to  plasmid-coded broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) discovered in 1980 (e. coli,  k. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae). the first cefotaximase (ctx-m, men-1) was reported in europe in 1990. this enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. chromosomal hyperpoduction of k1 beta-lactamase differs from all other esbls due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (klebsiella oxytoca). however, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because  of esbls, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded ampc beta-lactamase of class c (mir-1, cmy-1, bil-1, fox-1, mox-1, dha-1, acc-1), resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, morganelle spp., serratia spp.). with the loss of outside-membrane porins (omp) they can become resistant to carbapenem an  tibiotics. the 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of  carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined beta-lactamase of class b (imp-1, vim-1) and of class a (kpc-1) in k. pneumoniae, (sme-1) in serratia marcescens and (imi-1, nmc-a) in e. clocae. carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == potential prophylactic value of bovine colostrum in necrotizing enterocolitis in  neonates: an in vitro study on bacterial attachment, antibody levels and cytokine production.
AB  == necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is an important disease of low birth-weight neonates. the immaturity of the gut mucosa may result in close contact between the host epithelium and microorganisms which are normally confined to the gut lumen. damage of the mucosa due to endotoxin, cytokine production or other factors is believed to then occur. the aim of this study was to determine whether spray-dried bovine colostrum demonstrated potential in vitro as a prophylactic for nec. antiadherence was measured using a tissue culture assay and antibody levels against enterobacteriaceae were determined by elisa. the effect of bovine  colostrum on the production of cytokines implicated in nec was determined by a multiplex bead assay. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae were common in both nec positive and nec negative infants and iga and igg1 antibodies to these species were present in the bovine colostrum. pretreatment with bovine colostrum  produced a significant decrease (p<0.001) in attachment of bacteria to ht-29 cells. bovine colostrum significantly increased the production of il-8 in ht-29 cells and il-8, il-6 and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells (p<0.001). the potential of bovine colostrum to increase the production of inflammatory mediators could limit its usefulness.

AB  == bacteria harbouring the novel qnra plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. in total, 1,468 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in france during 2002-2005 and screened for qnra. overall, 28 isolates (22 enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnra, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of esbl-producing isolates (22% of the e. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-esbl-producing isolates. the prevalence of qnra among consecutive esbl-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). of the qnra-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. twenty-one of the 22 qnra-positive e. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. the qnra genetic environment was similar to that of the in36 integron. the remaining two isolates had qnra variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. the esbl gene associated with qnra was bla(shv-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(per-1) and bla(shv-2a) were found in two isolates. in france, it appears that qnra-positive isolates are predominantly e. cloacae isolates producing shv-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an in36-like integron.

AB  == febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. all microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of febros river. from  the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. considering that these klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. from the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only escherichia  coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-d-glucuronidase test. all other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-d-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of escherichia coli in environmental waters.

AB  == two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (123), escherichia coli (114), klebsiella oxytoca (7), enterobacter cloacae (5) and citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive by the vitek system (gns-526 card), were collected. these strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the royal infirmary of edinburgh (rie), edinburgh, uk (and associated gp practices), hairmyers hospital, glasgow, uk, and the amiri  and farwania hospitals, kuwait. of the 101 rie strains tested, 15 e. coli strains were found to be esbl negative by etest esbl strips. on retesting the 15 e. coli  strains with the vitek gns-532 card, 14 were found to be esbl negative, despite being originally flagged as esbl positive. the remaining 236 esbl-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (ddd) technique for the  detection of esbls. of these, two were false negatives by etest esbl test strips  (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the ddd method. the etest false-negative esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae  were positive by ddd. technically, the vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test  card. etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. the ddd test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the esbl-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. despite the false-positive esbl-producing e. coli strains, the vitek susceptibility card with its integral esbl test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and e. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.

TI  == emergence of dha-1-producing klebsiella spp. in the parisian region: genetic organization of the ampc and ampr genes originating from morganella morganii.
AB  == eleven klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and one klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate showing various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types and producing an inducible dha-1 class c beta-lactamase were isolated in the parisian region between 1998 and 2003. the aim of this study was to compare the genetic organization of the bla(dha-1) genes in this collection of clinical isolates. in  four isolates, the morganella morganii-derived genomic region containing bla(dha-1) was inserted in an entire complex sul1-type integron, including a region common to in6-in7 (cr1), as previously described in a bla(dha-1)-producing salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis kf92 isolate from saudi arabia in 1992. different gene cassette arrays were characterized in each of these integrons. in  two of them, an additional 10-kb fragment was inserted between the cr1 and the m. morganii-derived region and was similar to the sap (abc transporter family) and psp (phage shock protein) operons originated from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the length of the m. morganii region was variable, suggesting that several independent recombination events have occurred and that open reading frame orf513 encodes a recombinase involved in the mobilization of the resistance genes. the genetic organization of bla(dha-1) was identical in the eight other isolates. this structure is likely derived from a complex integron following the  insertion of is26, leading to the deletion of the first part of integron. the horizontal transfer of one plasmid carrying that truncated integron was shown for seven of these isolates.

TI  == activity of human beta-defensins 2 and 3 against esbl-producing klebsiella strains.
AB  == objectives: to test the bactericidal activity of human beta-defensins (hbds) 2 and 3 against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella strains. methods: thirty-six klebsiella pneumoniae and seventeen klebsiella oxytoca esbl-producing isolates from nosocomial infections were tested. the bactericidal activity of recombinantly synthesized hbd-2 and -3 was tested and the results were given either as lethal doses killing > or = 90% of bacteria (ld90s) or as mbcs (> or = 99.9% killing). results: except for one intermediately susceptible strain (mbc = 25 mg/l), all other esbl-producing strains were highly  susceptible to both defensins (ld90s and mbcs < or = 12.5 mg/l). conclusions: the results underline the high efficacy of hbd-2 and -3 against esbl-producing klebsiella, making both defensins attractive candidates as antimicrobial agents to combat these increasingly troublesome bacteria.

TI  == faster identification of pathogens in positive blood cultures by fluorescence in  situ hybridization in routine practice.
AB  == rapid identification of microorganisms in blood cultures is required to optimize  empirical treatment at an early stage. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish)  can reduce the time to identification of microorganisms in growth-positive blood  cultures. in this study, we evaluated the performance, time to identification, and potential clinical benefits of fish compared to those of conventional culture methods in routine practice. after gram staining, blood culture fluids were simultaneously further identified with fish and with conventional culture methods. results and points in time of fish and culture identification (provisional and final identifications) were collected and compared. for 91% of microorganisms, the genus or family name was identified, and for 79%, the species name could be attributed. the sensitivity and specificity of the individual probes exceeded 95%, except for the enterobacteriaceae probe (sensitivity, 89%).  cross-hybridization was obtained with the klebsiella pneumoniae probe for klebsiella oxytoca. the time gains of fish and final culture identification were  more than 18 h for bacteria and 42 h for yeasts. with fish, staphylococcus aureus was differentiated from coagulase-negative staphylococci 1.4 h faster than by provisional identification (p < 0.001). in conclusion, fish allows rapid and reliable identification of the majority of microorganisms in growth-positive blood cultures. the substantial time gain of identification with fish may allow same-day adjustment of antimicrobial therapy, and fish is especially useful if no provisional identification is obtained. with further extension of the number of probes and a reduction in turnaround time, fish will become a very useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of bloodstream infections.

TI  == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB  == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of  the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by  those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low  prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for  the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == predictive modelling of growth and measurement of enzymatic synthesis and activity by a cocktail of selected enterobacteriaceae and aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == the possibility was examined of developing a predictive model that would predict  food spoilage by combining microbial growth (increase in cellular number) with extracellular enzymatic activity of a cocktail of five strains of enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris and one aeromonas hydrophila  strain. estimations of growth and enzyme activity were made within a three-dimensional matrix of conditions: temperature 2-20 degrees c, ph value 4.0-7.5 and water activity (a(w)) 0.95-0.995. a mathematical model was constructed which predicted growth based on increases in cell number. however, although notable effects of extracellular lipases and proteases were detected, it was not possible to model enzymatic activity and prepare a combined model because the data did not follow the characteristic profile that would allow curve-fitting. nevertheless, the model for microbial growth and information relating to enzyme activity will be made freely available in a database on the internet.

TI  == occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical isolates of klebsiella species from harar region, eastern ethiopia.
AB  == extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) producer and multidrug resistant klebsiella spp. are becoming a major nosocomial pathogen globally. there are no documented reports yet on the occurrence of esbl enzymes in klebsiella spp. species from ethiopia. this study was undertaken to isolate and determine the occurrence of esbls and multi-drug resistant klebsiella spp. in different clinical samples obtained from patients. a cross-sectional survey was conducted in four different hospitals of harar region (hiwot fana, misrak-arbegnoch, police and army) from december 2003 to february 2004. three hundred and eighty four clinical specimens (202 sputum, 164 urine and 18 pus) were collected from patients admitted in different wards. antimicrobial susceptibilities were performed on 57 clinical isolates by standard disk diffusion procedures against eight antimicrobial agents. the esbls detection was made by using cefotaxime and  ceftazidime alone and in combination with clavulanate. a total of 57 (15%) klebsiella spp. were isolated from 384 patients. of the 57 isolates, 33 (58%) were from sputum, 18 (31.5%) from urine and 6 (10.5%) from pus. of the 57 klebsiella spp., 54 (94.7%) were identified as k. pneumoniae and 3 (5.3%) as k. oxytoca. resistance was found against cephalosporins [cefotaxime (39.0%), cefoxitin (39.0%), ceftazidime (40.0%), ceftriaxone (40.0%), cephalothin (42.0%)], chloramphenicol (70.0%), gentamicin (61.0%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (65.0%). analyzed klebsiella isolates were characterized also by a high degree of multi-resistance (67.0%). in 19/57 (33.3%) of the klebsiella isolates, esbl production was detected. rates of detection of esbl producers were 42.1, 26.3, 26.3 and 5.3% in hiwot-fana, misrak-arbegnoch, police and army hospitals, respectively. multi-drug resistant isolates were more  prevalent among the esbls producers (95.0%) than non-producers (53.0%) (p=0.24).  in conclusion, our results show that awareness of esbl production by klebsiella spp. is clinically important. in the absence of infection control measures, esbl  producing organisms readily pass horizontally from patient to patient. these strains also transiently colonize the hands of hospital staff members, thereby facilitating patient-to-patient transmission of the organism.

TI  == impact of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy on mortality in infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: variability by  site of infection.
AB  == background: infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species (esbl-ek) have increased markedly in recent years. risk factors for mortality among esbl-ek infections have not been studied. methods: this retrospective cohort study was conducted in a 625-bed tertiary care medical center and a 344-bed urban community hospital to determine  whether inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (iiat) (>48 hours between the time a culture was obtained and initiation of an agent to which the infecting organism was susceptible) is associated with mortality in esbl-ek infections. all hospitalized patients with an esbl-ek infection between june 1, 1997, and december 31, 2002, were eligible for inclusion. subsequently, we conducted a nested case-control study to identify risk factors for iiat. results: of 187 subjects, 32 (17.1%) died while in the hospital. clinical site of infection was a significant effect modifier in the association between iiat and mortality. the presence of iiat was an independent risk factor for mortality, but only for nonurinary esbl-ek infections (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 10.04 [1.90-52.96]). independent risk factors for iiat were (1) infection with a  multidrug-resistant esbl-ek (ie, resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, aminoglycosides, and quinolones) (14.58 [1.91-111.36]) and (2) health care-acquired esbl-ek infection (4.32 [1.49-12.54]). conclusions: inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy is an independent risk factor for mortality in esbl-ek infections, but only among nonurinary infections. multidrug resistance was a strong risk factor for iiat.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == major structural proteins of type 1 and type 3 klebsiella fimbriae are effective  protein carriers and immunogens in conjugates as revealed from their immunochemical characterization.
AB  == fimbriae are filamentous structures present on the cell surface of many bacteria, including genus klebsiella. the use of fimbriae as protein carriers in conjugates may allow to formulate effective multivalent vaccines and suitable diagnostics. however, the evidences have been reported that fimbriae may enhance the inflammatory response. this prompted us to examine the degree of cytokine induction by the type 1 and type 3 klebsiella fimbriae and their conjugates. fimbriae were assessed as carrier proteins for escherichia coli k12 endotoxin core oligosaccharide. maldi-ms revealed the molecular mass of fimbrial monomer major protein, which was 15,847 da for type 1 and 18,574 da for type 3 fimbriae of klebsiella. these two types of fimbriae were moderate inductors of il-6 and interferon and almost inactive with regard to the stimulation of tnf when tested  in human whole blood assay. coupling of fimbriae with e. coli k12 core oligosaccharide gave immunogenic conjugates with respect to a saccharide ligand and protein carrier, although only 10% of the pilin monomers possessed the attached oligosaccharide. rabbit antiserum reacted with a broad spectrum of lipopolysaccharides, as measured by elisa and immunoblotting assays. the antibodies against glycoconjugates were bactericidal for the wild, s-type bacteria of some species. regarding the induction of cytokines by conjugates only the tnf level was noticeably elevated. these results prompt for the practical use of fimbriae, as effective protein carriers for conjugates to obtain broad-spectrum antisera for diagnostic applications.

AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus mirabilis. strains  of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a korean tertiary care hospital between june and december 2002. induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the bladha allele was detected by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns were also analyzed. among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7%  of e. coli, 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of p. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were bladha-1 allele positive. to  the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bladha-1 in p. mirabilis.  the mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. presence of multiple pfge patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated bladha-1 in klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.

TI  == phage associated bacteriocins reveal a novel mechanism for bacteriocin diversification in klebsiella.
AB  == ninety-six isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca were recovered from wild mammals in australia. 14.6% of these bacteria produce killing phenotypes that suggest the production of bacteriocin toxins. cloning and sequencing of the  gene clusters encoding two of these killing phenotypes revealed two instances of  a bacteriocin associated with a bacteriophage gene, the first such genetic organization described. the newly identified klebicin c gene cluster was discovered in both k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca. the newly identified klebicin d  gene cluster was detected in k. oxytoca. protein sequence comparisons and phylogenetic inference suggest that klebicin c is most closely related to the rrnase group of colicins (such as colicin e4), while klebicin d is most closely related to the trnase group of colicins (such as colicin d). the klebicin c and d gene clusters have similar genetic and regulatory organizations. in both cases, an operon structure is inferred consisting of a phage-associated open reading frame and klebicin activity and associated immunity genes. this novel bacteriophage/bacteriocin organization may provide a novel mechanism for the generation of bacteriocin diversity in klebsiella.

AB  == biodegradation of endosulfan, a chlorinated cyclodiene insecticide, is generally  accompanied by production of the more toxic and more persistent metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. since our reported endosulfan degrader, klebsiella pneumoniae ke-1, failed to degrade endosulfan sulfate, we tried to isolate an endosulfan sulfate degrader from endosulfan-polluted soils. through repetitive enrichment and successive subculture using mineral salt medium containing endosulfan or endosulfan sulfate as the sole source of carbon and energy, we isolated a bacterium capable of degrading endosulfan sulfate as well as endosulfan. the bacterium ke-8 was identified as klebsiella oxytoca from the results of 16s rdna  sequence analysis. in biodegradation assays with ke-8 using mineral salt medium containing endosulfan (150 mg l(-1)) or endosulfan sulfate (173 mg l(-1)), the biomass was rapidly increased to an optical density at 550 nm of 1.9 in 4 days and the degradation constants for alpha- and beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan sulfate were 0.3084, 0.2983 and 0.2465 day(-1), respectively. analysis of the metabolites further suggested that k. oxytoca ke-8 has high potential as a biocatalyst for bioremediation of endosulfan and/or endosulfan sulfate.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == evaluation of a new screen agar plate for detection and presumptive identification of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == a new agar screen plate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection was evaluated with 50 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species: enterobacter cloacae (n = 10), escherichia coli (n = 10), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 25), and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). fecal samples  were artificially inoculated with 2 concentrations (25 and 250 colony forming units [cfu]/plate) of the test strains and then applied to the new agar screen plates. by this approach, the new agar formula detected growth that was suggestive of esbl activity in 44 of 50 (88%) and 50 of 50 (100%) of esbl strains with 25 and 250 cfu/plate, respectively. a limitation of the agar screen plates was a lack of some specificity. among 15 strains with resistant phenotypes other  than esbl (k1 producers of k. oxytoca, 6 strains; 9 strains with ampc phenotype), growth was recorded in 7 (25 cfu/plate) and 11 (250 cfu/plate) of 15 strains. in  conclusion, the new agar screen plate is a sensitive and convenient method to directly screen for esbl organisms in rectal swabs or stool samples, with the potential for incorporation into routine clinical laboratory service.

AB  == the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among 357 clinical isolates of escherichia coli and 175 of klebsiella spp. was studied using both the national committee for clinical laboratory standards disk diffusion method and the semiautomated wider system. we highlight the predominance of e. coli (50, 92.6%) among positive samples and the largely outpatient origin of these (40, 80%), including 39 samples of urine (97.5%) and one of urethral exudate. there were only four esbl-producing isolates of klebsiella spp. (7.4%), and three were  in outpatient urine samples (75%, 2 k. oxytoca and 1 k. pneumoniae). the positive and negative predictive values for the wider system were 81% and 98.5%, respectively. we stress the high incidence of esbl in our setting, the predominance of cases in the outpatient setting, and the acceptable detection of  esbl by means of the wider system in e. coli and klebsiella spp.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == recommended test panel for differentiation of klebsiella species on the basis of  a trilateral interlaboratory evaluation of 18 biochemical tests.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca are the two most frequently encountered klebsiella species giving rise to infections in humans, but other klebsiella species can also be found in clinical specimens: klebsiella ozaenae, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, klebsiella terrigena, klebsiella planticola, klebsiella ornithinolytica, and enterobacter aerogenes (klebsiella mobilis). however, many of these species are indistinguishable by the conventional methods  employed routinely in the clinical microbiological laboratory. several investigators have suggested various additional tests, but as yet there is no standardized test panel for identifying all klebsiella species and subspecies. in the present study, performed in three national klebsiella reference laboratories, we have evaluated a test panel consisting of 18 biochemical tests on 242 strains  comprising all klebsiella species and subspecies. the test panel was designed to  identify organisms preliminarily identified as belonging to the genus klebsiella  on the basis of conventional methods or automated identification systems. with the described test panel it is possible to find one or more positive test results differentiating any klebsiella species, except klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, from  its closest relative.

TI  == the genes and enzymes for the catabolism of galactitol, d-tagatose, and related carbohydrates in klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and other enteric bacteria display convergent evolution.
AB  == enteric bacteria (enteriobacteriaceae) carry on their single chromosome about 4000 genes that all strains have in common (referred to here as "obligatory genes"), and up to 1300 "facultative" genes that vary from strain to strain and from species to species. in closely related species, obligatory and facultative genes are orthologous genes that are found at similar loci. we have analyzed a set of facultative genes involved in the degradation of the carbohydrates galactitol, d-tagatose, d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine in various pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of these bacteria. the four carbohydrates are transported into the cell by phosphotransferase (pts) uptake systems, and are metabolized by closely related or even identical catabolic enzymes via pathways that share several intermediates. in about 60% of escherichia coli strains the genes for galactitol degradation map to a gat operon at 46.8 min. in strains of salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, the corresponding gat  genes, although orthologous to their e. coli counterparts, are found at 70.7 min, clustered in a regulon together with three tag genes for the degradation of d-tagatose, an isomer of d-fructose. in contrast, in all the e. coli strains tested, this chromosomal site was found to be occupied by an aga/kba gene cluster for the degradation of d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine. the aga/kba and the tag genes were paralogous either to the gat cluster or to the fru genes for degradation of d-fructose. finally, in more then 90% of strains of both klebsiella species, and in about 5% of the e. coli strains, two operons were found at 46.8 min that comprise paralogous genes for catabolism of the isomers d-arabinitol (genes atl or dal) and ribitol (genes rtl or rbt). in these strains  gat genes were invariably absent from this location, and they were totally absent in s. enterica. these results strongly indicate that these various gene clusters  and metabolic pathways have been subject to convergent evolution among the enterobacteriaceae. this apparently involved recent horizontal gene transfer and  recombination events, as indicated by major chromosomal rearrangements found in their immediate vicinity.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == discrimination of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca phylogenetic groups and other klebsiella species by use of amplified fragment length polymorphism.
AB  == bacteria of the genus klebsiella are opportunistic pathogens responsible for an increasing number of multiresistant infections in hospitals. the two clinically and epidemiologically most important species, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, have recently been shown to be subdivided into three and two phylogenetic groups, respectively. the aim of this study was an in depth evaluation of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) genetic characterization method for epidemiological and phylogenic analyzes of klebsiella isolates. first, we investigated the variability of aflp patterns for klebsiella  strains within and between different outbreaks. second, by use of carefully characterized phylogenetically representative strains, we examined whether different klebsiella species and phylogenetic groups can be discriminated using aflp. twenty-four strains originating from seven presumed outbreaks and 31 non-associated strains were investigated. the aflp fingerprints of all epidemiologically associated strains showed three or fewer fragment differences,  whereas unrelated strains differed by at least four fragments. cluster analysis of the aflp data revealed a very high concordance with the phylogenetic assignation of strains based on the gyra sequence and ribotyping data. the species k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. terrigena and the possibly synonymous pair  k. planticola/k. ornithinolytica each formed a separate cluster. similarly, strains of the phylogenetic groups of k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca fell into their corresponding clusters, with only two exceptions. this study provides a preliminary cut-off value for distinguishing epidemiologically non-related klebsiella isolates based on aflp data; it confirms the sharp delineation of the  recently identified phylogenetic groups, and demonstrates that aflp is suitable for identification of klebsiella species and phylogenetic groups.

TI  == epidemiology of conjugative plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases in the united states.
AB  == a sample of 752 resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli strains from 70 sites in 25 u.s. states and the district of columbia was examined for transmissibility of resistance to ceftazidime and the nature of the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase involved. fifty-nine percent of the k. pneumoniae, 24% of the k. oxytoca, and 44% of the e. coli isolates transferred resistance to ceftazidime. plasmids encoding ampc-type beta-lactamase were found  in 8.5% of the k. pneumoniae samples, 6.9% of the k. oxytoca samples, and 4% of the e. coli samples, at 20 of the 70 sites and in 10 of the 25 states. act-1 beta-lactamase was found at eight sites, four of which were near new york city, where the act-1 enzyme was first discovered; act-1 beta-lactamase was also found  in massachusetts, pennsylvania, and virginia. fox-5 beta-lactamase was also found at eight sites, mainly in southeastern states but also in new york. two e. coli strains produced cmy-2, and one k. pneumoniae strain produced dha-1 beta-lactamase. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis suggested that ampc-mediated resistance spread both by strain and plasmid dissemination. all ampc beta-lactamase-containing isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, but so were 11% of strains containing transmissible shv- and tem-type extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases. a beta-lactamase inhibitor test was helpful in distinguishing the two types of resistance but was not definitive since 24% of clinical isolates producing ampc beta-lactamase had a positive response to clavulanic acid. coexistence of ampc and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was the main reason for these discrepancies. plasmid-mediated ampc-type enzymes are thus responsible for  an appreciable fraction of resistance in clinical isolates of klebsiella spp. and e. coli, are disseminated around the united states, and are not so easily distinguished from other enzymes that mediate resistance to oxyimino-beta-lactams.

AB  == nccls screening and confirmation methods for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) apply only to escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., yet esbls have been found in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the effectiveness of nccls methods for detecting esbls in 690 gram-negative isolates of enterobacteriaceae that excluded e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. isolates were collected between january 1996  and june 1999 from 53 u.s. hospitals participating in project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology). the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates were determined by using the nccls broth microdilution method (bmd), and those isolates for which the mic of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam was >or=2 microg/ml or the mic of cefpodoxime was >or=8 microg/ml (positive esbl screen test) were further tested for a clavulanic acid (ca) effect by bmd and the disk diffusion method (confirmation tests). although 355 (51.4%) of the isolates were esbl screen test positive, only 15 (2.2%) showed a ca effect. since 3 of the 15 isolates were already highly resistant to the five nccls indicator drugs, esbl detection would have an impact on the reporting of only 1.7% of the isolates in the study. only 6 of the 15 isolates that showed a ca effect contained a bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), or bla(oxa) beta-lactamase  gene as determined by pcr (with a corresponding isoelectric focusing pattern). extension of the nccls guidelines for esbl detection to enterobacteriaceae other  than e. coli and klebsiella spp. does not appear to be warranted in the united states at present, since the test has poor specificity for this population and would result in changes in categorical interpretations for only 1.7% of enterobacteriaceae tested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == a molecular phylogeny for seven taxa of enteric bacteria (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia plymuthica) was made from multiple isolates per taxa taken from a collection of environmental enteric bacteria. sequences from five housekeeping genes (gapa, groel, gyra, ompa, and pgi) and the 16s rrna  gene were used to infer individual gene trees and were concatenated to infer a composite molecular phylogeny for the species. the isolates from each taxa formed tight species clusters in the individual gene trees, suggesting the existence of  'genotypic' clusters that correspond to traditional species designations. these sequence data and the resulting gene trees and consensus tree provide the first data set with which to assess the utility of the recently proposed core genome hypothesis (cgh). the cgh provides a genetically based approach to applying the biological species concept to bacteria.

TI  == carbapenem-resistant strain of klebsiella oxytoca harboring carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase kpc-2.
AB  == we investigated a klebsiella oxytoca isolate demonstrating resistance to imipenem, meropenem, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aztreonam. the mics of both imipenem and meropenem were 32 microg/ml. the beta-lactamase activity against imipenem and meropenem was inhibited in the presence of clavulanic acid.  isoelectric focusing studies demonstrated five beta-lactamases with pis of 8.2 (shv-46), 6.7 (kpc-2), 6.5 (unknown), 6.4 (probable oxy-2), and 5.4 (tem-1). the  presence of the bla(shv) and bla(tem) genes was confirmed by specific pcr assays  and dna sequence analysis. transformation and conjugation studies with escherichia coli showed that the beta-lactamase with a pi of 6.7, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (kpc-2), was encoded on an approximately 70-kb conjugative plasmid that also carried shv-46, tem-1, and the beta-lactamase with  a pi of 6.5. the bla(kpc-2) determinant was cloned in e. coli and conferred resistance to imipenem, meropenem, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aztreonam. the amino acid sequence of kpc-2 showed a single amino acid difference, s174g, when compared with kpc-1, another carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from k. pneumoniae 1534. hydrolysis studies showed that purified kpc-2 hydrolyzed not only carbapenems but also penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. kpc-2 had the highest affinity for meropenem. the kinetic studies revealed that kpc-2 was inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam. an examination of the outer membrane proteins of the parent k. oxytoca strain demonstrated that it expressed detectable levels of ompk36 (the homolog of ompc)  and a higher-molecular-weight ompk35 (the homolog of ompf). thus, carbapenem resistance in k. oxytoca 3127 is due to production of the bush group 2f, class a, carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase kpc-2. this beta-lactamase is likely located on a transposon that is part of a conjugative plasmid and thus has a very high potential for dissemination.

TI  == confirmation of escherichia coli and its distinction from klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees c.
AB  == aims: in the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. the test for gas production has recently been questioned. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of e. coli. methods and results: the impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees c using 547 environmental isolates. these were mainly e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae strains. another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (tmax) and for gas formation. escherichia coli and even k. pneumoniae  grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. growth of the mainly gas negative ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (trm). tmax of k. oxytoca was clearly lower than tmax of k. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees c. conclusions: false-positive e. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. significance and impact of the study:  erroneous positive results on routine analysis for e. coli can occur.

TI  == evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of escherichia coli o157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
AB  == we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for  all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm  gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched  samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).

TI  == comparison of the e-test method with an automated bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility detection system for screening extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers.
AB  == some automated systems used in clinical microbiology laboratories are able to detect products responsible for antimicrobial resistance. in this study, 626 isolates (436 escherichia coli, 134 klebsiella pneumoniae and 56 klebsiella oxytoca strains) were examined for the presumptive detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by 2 methods: the sceptor system (bd, sparks, md, usa) and the e-test. esbl production was detected in 26 e. coli strains (5.96%), 60 k. pneumoniae strains (44.77%) and 15 k. oxytoca strains (26.78%) by  ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate e-test. using the e-test, esbl production was detected in 25 of 201 e. coli strains (12.43%), 55 of 75 k. pneumoniae (73.33%) and 14 of 27 k. oxytoca strains (51.85%) that were alerted as esbl-producing strains by the sceptor system. esbl positivity was detected in 1 e. coli, 5 k. pneumoniae and 1 k. oxytoca strains, that were not warned as being esbl producers by the sceptor system. these data suggest that clinical microbiology laboratories should not only rely on these rapid automated systems but also use another method for screening esbl producers, such as the e-test. the rates of these esbl-producing isolates in this study were lower than those in other studies reported from other parts of turkey, but higher than those reported from the usa  and europe.

TI  == type ii protein secretion and its relationship to bacterial type iv pili and archaeal flagella.
AB  == homologues of the protein constituents of the klebsiella pneumoniae (klebsiella oxytoca) type ii secreton (t2s), the pseudomonas aeruginosa type iv pilus/fimbrium biogenesis machinery (t4p) and the methanococcus voltae flagellum  biogenesis machinery (fla) have been identified. known constituents of these systems include (1). a major prepilin (preflagellin), (2). several minor prepilins (preflagellins), (3). a prepilin (preflagellin) peptidase/methylase, (4). an atpase, (5). a multispanning transmembrane (tm) protein, (6). an outer-membrane secretin (lacking in fla) and (7). several functionally uncharacterized envelope proteins. sequence and phylogenetic analyses led to the  conclusion that, although many of the protein constituents are probably homologous, extensive sequence divergence during evolution clouds this homology so that a common ancestry can be established for all three types of systems for only two constituents, the atpase and the tm protein. sequence divergence of the  individual t2s constituents has occurred at characteristic rates, apparently without shuffling of constituents between systems. the same is probably also true for the t4p and fla systems. the family of atpases is much larger than the family of tm proteins, and many atpase homologues function in capacities unrelated to those considered here. many phylogenetic clusters of the atpases probably exhibit uniform function. some of these have a corresponding tm protein homologue although others probably function without one. it is further shown that proteins  that compose the different phylogenetic clusters in both the atpase and the tm protein families exhibit unique structural characteristics that are of probable functional significance. the tm proteins are shown to have arisen by at least two dissimilar intragenic duplication events, one in the bacterial kingdom and one in the archaeal kingdom. the archaeal tm proteins are twice as large as the bacterial tm proteins, suggesting an oligomeric structure for the latter.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic analysis of a hospital's extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates over a 2-year period.
AB  == study objective: to evaluate the microbiologic and clinical outcomes of patients  with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates over a 2-year period. design: retrospective analysis. setting: tertiary care teaching hospital. patients: twenty-one patients with cultures of confirmed esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, or klebsiella oxytoca. measurements and  main results: antimicrobial susceptibilities of piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotetan, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin (nitrofurantoin for urinary isolates only) of confirmed esbl producers at our institution were determined, as well as clinical outcomes of patients with esbl-producing isolates. microbiologic and medical records were reviewed for patient sex and age, antimicrobial susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy, and clinical and microbiologic outcomes. from january 2000-december 2001, 31 isolates were confirmed as esbl producers (6  e. coli, 11 k. pneumoniae, and 14 k. oxytoca). a statistically significant increase occurred over the 2-year period from 9 (0.6%) of 1414 isolates in 2000 to 22 (1.8%) of 1218 isolates in 2001 (p = 0.0055). all isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, and more than 88% were susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, or nitrofurantoin. less than 70% of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. all  patients treated with a carbapenem experienced clinical cure. piperacillin-tazobactam alone and in combination resulted in an overall clinical  cure rate of 55%, with a 50% cure rate for isolates susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. all patients in whom antibiotic therapy failed had been  treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime, either alone or in combination  with a fluoroquinolone. conclusion: carbapenems remain the treatment of choice for esbl-producing pathogens. piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime should not be  routinely administered for the treatment of these organisms.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == cloning, characterization, and functional expression of the klebsiella oxytoca xylodextrin utilization operon (xyntb) in escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli is being developed as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. potential substrates  include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and xylobiose that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. adjacent genes encoding xylobiose uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic e. coli. the xylosidase encoded by xynb contains the cog3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. the xynt gene encodes a membrane  protein containing the melb domain (cog2211) found in na(+)/melibiose symporters  and related proteins. these two genes form a bicistronic operon that appears to be regulated by xylose (xylr) and by catabolite repression in both k. oxytoca and recombinant e. coli. homologs of this operon were found in klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus lactis, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, and bacillus subtilis  based on sequence comparisons. based on similarities in protein sequence, the xyntb genes in k. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to l. lactis. functional expression of xynb allowed ethanologenic e. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4-o-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further  degradation by the xynb xylosidase. the rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant e. coli was increased when a full-length xynt gene was included with  xynb, consistent with xynt functioning as a symport. hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with xylobiose as the preferred substrate. xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant e. coli than k. oxytoca m5a1 (the source of xynt and xynb). xynb exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3% that of xylosidase.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology of local enterobacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. between 1 january, 1998, and 31 december, 2001, we studied the sensitivity of 2,238 enterobacteria to 26 different antibiotic agents in northern lebanon, in the microbiology department and laboratory of the islami  hospital, tripoli, lebanon. we used the diffusion disk method and complied with the guidelines of the french microbiology society antibiogram committee. urinary  samples were the most frequent source (67.5%), followed by blood cultures (12.7%). the dominant species in blood cultures was s. typhi (44.7%). we found 194 strains that produced extended-spectrum beta lactamases (esbl), with the highest prevalence in serratia spp. (44.3%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (23.7%), escherichia coli (20.7%) and klebsiella oxytoca (11.3%). the global susceptibility of these strains to aminopenicillin was 15%; it reached 30% when combined with clavulanic acid. susceptibility of the esbl strains to these agents was 0%. the global susceptibility (and that of the esbl strains, when greater than 0%) to other antibiotics was as follows: ticarcillin 38.5%, piperacillin 38.5%, piperacillin-tazobactam 88% (64%), imipenem 99.4%, (100%), cefalexin 41%,  cefoxitin 65% (40.3%), cefuroxime 75%, amikacin 89%, chloramphenicol 30%, gentamicin 78% (42%), tetracycline 28% (16%), minocycline 30% (18.4%), colistin 67% (75%), nitrofuran 40% (45%), cotrimoxazol 40% (13%), nalidixic acid 53% (5.6%), pefloxacin 63% (23%), ciprofloxacin 71% (39%), and levofloxacin 72% (47%).

TI  == identification of klebsiella oxytoca using a specific pcr assay targeting the polygalacturonase pehx gene.
AB  == bacteria of the genus klebsiella are important opportunistic pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. distinctive identification of the species k. oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, k. planticola, k. ornithinolytica and k. terrigena is difficult based on phenotypic tests and misidentifications are frequent in routine clinical microbiology. we developed a specific method to discriminate k. oxytoca from the  other species of the genus klebsiella, based on the pcr amplification of the polygalacturonase (pehx) gene. a pcr amplicon of 344 bp was obtained in all 35 k. oxytoca strains tested, but in none of the 29 k. pneumoniae, 12 k. planticola/k.  ornithinolytica and 7 k. terrigena strains tested. the test was also negative for polygalacturonate-degrading species of the genus erwinia. analysis of 24 strains  designated as k. pneumoniae from international collections (nctc, pzh) revealed previous misidentification of six k. oxytoca strains. key biochemical tests fully confirmed the pehx pcr results. the new k. oxytoca identification assay should be useful for both clinical and ecological monitoring of k. oxytoca strains, as well as for controlling the previous identification of collection strains.

AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == analysis of three outbreaks due to klebsiella species in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to investigate the clinical, microbiological, and epidemiologic features of three outbreaks caused by klesiella during 3 years. setting: neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital. patients: thirty affected neonates. methods: data were collected through chart reviews and conversations with physicians. screening samples were obtained from the staff, the neonates, and the environment. antibiogram typing and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction-based fingerprinting were used to type the strains. results: the first outbreak had 13 k. pneumoniae strains isolated. the second outbreak had 10 k. oxytoca strains isolated. the third outbreak had 20 k. pneumoniae strains isolated. more than half of the patients had low birth weights, were premature, and underwent mechanical ventilation and intravenous catheterization. approximately three-fourths of the patients died. the isolates tested were completely susceptible to meropenem, cefoxitin, and ciprofloxacin and were resistant to cephalothin. more than half of these strains were resistant to many  beta-lactam antibiotics, amikacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. typing procedures yielded 3 antibiotypes and 3 genotypes among the isolates of the first outbreak, 3 antibiotypes with 1 subtype and 2 genotypes with 1 subtype in the second outbreak, and 2 antibiotypes and 2 genotypes in the third outbreak. conclusions: klebsiella outbreaks mainly affected premature neonates with intravenous catheters, mechanical ventilation, or both. the high mortality rate (76.7%) was notable. resistance to multiple antibiotics, but mainly to broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics, was observed, particularly in k. pneumoniae isolates. molecular typing indicated that the three outbreaks were not related to one other.

AB  == background & objectives: ampc beta-lactamases are group i cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. plasmid mediated ampc beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, salmonella, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 116 isolates of klebsiella species and 32 isolates of esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3gc) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of ampc beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and ampc beta lactamase production from ampc producing klebsiella and esch. coli isolates to a recipient  esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of esch. coli were found to be ampc beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of klebsiella and esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3gcs. all the strains were found to be  sensitive to imipenem. eighty four (72%) of klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the ampc producing strains of klebsiella spp. of the 12 ampc producing strains of esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the occurrence of ampc beta-lactamase producing klebsiella and esch. coli strains in children in chennai. since ampc beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of klebsiella and esch. coli infections. also failure to identify ampc beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate  antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. detecting plasmid  mediated ampc beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for ampc detection are not well defined. if an investigational ampc beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm ampc production.

TI  == production of cellulose and curli fimbriae by members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., and klebsiella spp. isolated from the human  gut were investigated for the biosynthesis of cellulose and curli fimbriae (csg). while citrobacter spp. produced curli fimbriae and cellulose and enterobacter spp. produced cellulose with various temperature-regulatory programs, klebsiella  spp. did not show pronounced expression of those extracellular matrix components. investigation of multicellular behavior in two citrobacter species and enterobacter sakazakii showed an extracellular matrix, cell clumping, pellicle formation, and biofilm formation associated with the expression of cellulose and  curli fimbriae. in those three strains, the csgd-csgba region and the cellulose synthase gene bcsa were conserved. pcr screening for the presence of csgd, csga and bcsa revealed that besides klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca, all  species investigated harbored the genetic information for expression of curli fimbriae and cellulose. since citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., and klebsiella spp. are frequently found to cause biofilm-related infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, the human gut could serve as a reservoir for dissemination of biofilm-forming isolates.

TI  == type iv-like pili formed by the type ii secreton: specificity, composition, bundling, polar localization, and surface presentation of peptides.
AB  == the secreton or type ii secretion machinery of gram-negative bacteria includes several type iv pilin-like proteins (the pseudopilins) that are absolutely required for secretion. we previously reported the presence of a bundled pilus composed of the pseudopilin pulg on the surface of agar-grown escherichia coli k-12 cells expressing the klebsiella oxytoca pullulanase (pul) secreton genes at  high levels (n. sauvonnet, g. vignon, a. p. pugsley, and p. gounon, embo j. 19:2221-2228, 2000). we show here that pulg is the only pseudopilin in purified pili and that the phenomenon is not restricted to the pul secreton reconstituted  in e. coli or to pulg. for example, high-level expression of the endogenous e. coli gsp secreton genes caused production of bundled pili composed of the pseudopilin gspg, and the pul secreton was able to form pili composed of pulg-like proteins from secreton systems of other bacteria. pulg derivatives in which the c terminus was extended by the addition of eight different peptides were also assembled into pili and functioned in secretion. three of the c-terminal peptides were shown to be exposed along the entire length of the assembled pili. hence, the c terminus of pulg may represent a permissive site for the insertion of immunogenic epitopes or other peptide sequences. one of these pulg variants, with a six-histidine tag at its c terminus, formed nonpolar, nonbundled pili, suggesting that bundle formation and polar localization are not  correlated with the ability of pulg to function in secretion. we propose that the pulg pilus is an artifactual manifestation of a periplasmic "pseudopilus" and that cycles of pseudopilus extension and retraction within the periplasm propel pullulanase through secretin channels in the outer membrane. abnormally long pili that extend beyond the outer membrane are produced only when pilus length control and retraction are deregulated by overproduction of the major pseudopilus subunit (pulg).

TI  == quality control for beta-lactam susceptibility testing with a well-defined collection of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in spain.
AB  == eighteen enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 16 of them with well-defined beta-lactam resistance mechanisms, were sent to 52 spanish microbiology laboratories. interpretative categories for 8 extended-spectrum beta-lactams were collected. participating laboratories used their own routine susceptibility testing procedures (88% automatic systems, 10% disk diffusion, and 2% agar dilution). control results were established by two independent reference  laboratories by applying the nccls microdilution method and interpretative criteria. interpretative discrepancies were observed in 16% of the results (4.4%  for cefepime, 3.0% for aztreonam, 2.8% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.7% for cefotaxime [ctx] and ceftazidime, 1.1% for ceftriaxone, 0.9% for meropenem, and 0.3% for imipenem). high consistency with reference values (<5% of major plus very major errors) was observed with (i) american type culture collection quality control strains; (ii) strains with low-efficiency mechanisms inactivating extended-spectrum beta-lactams, such as oxa-1-producing escherichiacoli or shv-1-hyperproducing klebsiella pneumoniae; (iii) strains with highly efficient mechanisms, such as shv-5 porin-deficient k. pneumoniae, ctx-m-10 in enterobacter cloacae hyperproducing ampc, and p. aeruginosa with the mexab oprm efflux phenotype or hyperproducing ampc. low consistency (>30% major plus very major errors) was detected in k1-producing klebsiella oxytoca, ctx-m-9-producing e. coli, and in oprd(-) p. aeruginosa strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains accounted for 86% of very major errors. recognition of the esbl phenotype was particularly low in enterobacter cloacae strains (<35%), due to the lack of nccls-specific rules in this genus. a k1-producing k. oxytoca  was misidentified by 10% of laboratories as an esbl producer. the use of well-defined resistant strains is useful for improving proficiency in susceptibility testing in clinical laboratories.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == mutations which uncouple transport and phosphorylation in the d-mannitol phosphotransferase system of escherichia coli k-12 and klebsiella pneumoniae 1033-5p14.
AB  == mutants of escherichia coli k-12 were isolated which lack the normal phosphotransferase system-dependent catabolic pathway for d-mannitol (mtl). in some mutants the pts genes for the general proteins enzyme i and histidine protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems were deleted. other mutants expressed truncated mannitol-specific enzymes ii (ii(mtl)) which lacked the iia(mtl) or iiba(mtl) domain(s), and the mtla genes originated either from e. coli k-12 or from klebsiella pneumoniae 1033-5p14. the  dald gene from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 was cloned on single-copy plasmids and transformed into the strains described above. this gene encodes an nad-dependent  d-arabinitol dehydrogenase (dald) which converts d-arabinitol into d-xylulose and also converts d-mannitol into d-fructose. the different strains were used to isolate mutations which allow efficient transport of mannitol through the nonphosphorylated ii(mtl) complexes by selecting for growth on this polyhydric alcohol. more than 40 different mutants were analyzed to determine their ability  to grow on mannitol, as well as their ability to bind and transport free mannitol and, after restoration of the missing domain(s), their ability to phosphorylate mannitol. four mutations were identified (e218a, e218v, h256p, and h256y); all of these mutations are located in the highly conserved loop 5 of the iic membrane-bound transporter, and two are located in its gihe motif. these mutations were found to affect the various functions in different ways. interestingly, in the presence of all ii(mtl) variants, whether they were in the  truncated form or in the complete form, in the phosphorylated form or in the nonphosphorylated form, and in the wild-type form or in the mutated form, growth  occurred on the low-affinity analogue d-arabinitol with good efficiency, while only the uncoupled mutated forms transported mannitol at a high rate.

TI  == sequencing of 16s rdna of klebsiella: taxonomic relations within the genus and to other enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the 16s rdnas of 20 strains of klebsiella were sequenced and used for construction of a phylogenetic tree together with already published enterobacteriaceae 16s rdna sequences. the taxonomy within the klebsiella genus,  as reflected by the 16s rdna tree, was in agreement with existing dna-dna hybridisation and numerical taxonomy data, indicating that for klebsiella, 16s rdna sequencing is a valid method for identification and taxonomical purposes. five closely related clusters were found in the klebsiella genus; cluster i, k. oxytoca; cluster ii, k. terrigena, cluster iii, k. planticola and k. ornithinolytica; cluster iv, enterobacter aerogenes (k. mobilis); and cluster v,  k. pneumoniae. the position of calymmatobacterium granulomatis within the genus and closest to k. pneumoniae was confirmed. for the species k. oxytoca, data seem to indicate a subdivision into two subspecies. in addition, a biochemically aberrant klebsiella strain (bec441) that was included in the analysis could not be assigned to any of the known species, but was found to be closest related to k. oxytoca. furthermore, the high sequence similarity between the two environmental species k. planticola and k. ornithinolytica does not justify a distinction of the two species. finally, within a 165-bp stretch of the 16s rdna  sequences, species-specific nucleotides were found.

AB  == objective: to detect the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in family enterobacteriaceae and analyze the antibiotic susceptibility of those esbls-producing strains. methods: esbls were determined by the double-disk confirmatory test and 8 antibiotic susceptibilities were tested with the disk disffusion method in those strains producing esbls. results: forty-seven esbls-producing strains comprised of 25 of e. coli, 14 of k. pneumoniae, 5 of e.  cloacae, 1 of k. oxytoca, 1 of k. rhinoscleromatis, and 1 of s. liquefaciens. the susceptibility rates of those strains were: 100% for imipenem and meropenem, 89.4% for piperacillin/tazobactam, 72.4% for cefoxitin and 65.9% for cefotetan. conclusion: e. coli and k. pneumoniae are the prime strains producing esbls in enterobacteriaceae. imipenem and meropenem are the best drugs to deal with those  esbls-producing strains. piperacillin/tazobactam is better than cephamycins and other beta-lactama/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.

TI  == use of multienzyme multiplex pcr amplified fragment length polymorphism typing in analysis of outbreaks of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae in an intensive care unit.
AB  == we developed and optimized a new modified amplified fragment length polymorphism  (aflp) typing method to obtain a multibanding fingerprint that can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. both to maximize the discriminatory power and to  facilitate the computer-assisted analysis, bacterial dna was digested with four different restriction enzymes. after ligation of adaptors to the dna fragments, pcr testing of various single primers was performed. two single primers that gave optimal results with regard to band resolution and discriminatory power were selected and combined. the computer-assisted analysis of fingerprint patterns was performed with pearson's product-moment correlation values of densitometric curves, without assigning bands to peaks. thus, the analysis is not subject to human interpretation errors. with this method, we investigated two outbreaks of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae in an intensive care unit and various sporadic isolates of k. pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. cluster analysis of isolates analyzed in different experiments and on different gels showed that fingerprint patterns clustered correctly according to subspecies or to the outbreaks. multienzyme multiplex pcr aflp revealed that the first outbreak was caused by two different types of strains. outbreak two was caused by yet another  strain of k. pneumoniae. in conclusion, the typing method used here is easy to perform and highly reproducible, and due to generation of complex banding patterns, it has a higher discriminatory power. furthermore, the multienzyme multiplex pcr fingerprints are easy to analyze, and a reliable database can be stored in the computer to facilitate comparison of future isolates of klebsiella  spp. the method can be performed in every clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == ammonium hydroxide hydrolysis: a valuable support in the maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis of lipid a fatty acid distribution.
AB  == lipid a is the lipophilic moiety of lipopolysaccharides (lpss), the major components of the external membrane of almost all gram-negative bacteria. it is responsible for the toxicity of lps and has a heterogeneous structure composed of a bis-phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone that is acylated at the positions 2, 3 of the glcn i (proximal) and glcn ii (distal) residue with o- and  n-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids (primary substitution). these fatty acids are further acylated by means of their 3-hydroxy groups (secondary substitution). the toxicity of lipid a is dependent on its primary structure; the number, the length, and the distribution of the fatty acids on the disaccharide backbone strongly influence the endotoxic activity. in this paper a general and easy methodology to obtain secondary fatty acid distribution, which is one of the most difficult issues in the structural determination of lipid a, is proposed. the method combines ammonium hydroxide hydrolysis and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (maldi)-mass spectrometry analysis and has been successfully proven with five different lipid a species. the procedure exploits the lower stability under mild alkaline conditions of acyl and acyloxyacyl esters with respect to that of the acyl and acyloxyacyl amides. the partially degraded lipid a species obtained are analyzed by maldi-ms. the generality of this approach was tested on five lipid as, namely those arising from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas reactans, and burkholderia caryophylli.

TI  == beta-lactamases involved in resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. clinical isolates collected between 1994 and 1996, in barcelona (spain).
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae that lack inducible chromosomal bla genes, and to determine the enzymes responsible for resistance. from all clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae strains isolated between 1994 and 1996, 88 of 7054 escherichia coli, seven of 581 klebsiella pneumoniae and 23 of 166 klebsiella oxytoca strains were studied because of their decreased susceptibilities to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (as reflected in intermediate susceptibilities and/or positive synergy tests and/or irregular crenellated inhibition zones). the most frequent mechanism implicated in decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins displayed by e. coli and k. oxytoca was hyperproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase, followed by plasmid-mediated shv-1 hyperproduction in e. coli. in our hospital, the incidence of plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) between 1994 and 1996 was low. esbls were found in only 10 (0.14%) e. coli strains (six ctx-m-9, two tem-12 and two shv-2), in one (0.17%) k. pneumoniae strain (shv-2) and in no  k. oxytoca strains. the relatively wide variety of beta-lactamases that were detected among these common bacteria isolated from a single medical centre, including non-tem- and non-shv-derived esbls, appears epidemiologically remarkable.

AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == characterisation of the diol dehydratase pdu operon of lactobacillus collinoides.
AB  == the three genes (pducde) encoding the diol dehydratase of lactobacillus collinoides were sequenced. they exhibited strong identities with the ddrabc and  pducde genes of klebsiella oxytoca and salmonella enterica, respectively. these genes are part of a putative operon with at least four other genes. an eighth open reading frame was identified as homologous to the pocr gene (encoding the operon regulatory protein). although the enzyme was detected in exponential growth phase, pducde activity was increased at the end of exponential phase in presence of 1,2-propanediol.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of iv catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. design: case series. animals: 100 dogs. procedure: catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. the distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% nacl) solution. the saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. all bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. results: bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. most bacteria  that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (serratia odorifera, s. liquefaciens, s. marcescens, acinobacter anitratus, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp). only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus spp). high percentages of organisms were resistant  to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. conclusions and clinical  relevance: results suggest that iv catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == extended spectrum beta lactamase production & multidrug resistance in klebsiella  species isolated from children under five with intestinal & extraintestinal infections.
AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (es beta l) are enzymes produced in some gram-negative bacilli that mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins (3gc) and aztreonam. these are common in klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli and in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae.  es beta l production is accompanied by resistance to other antibiotics as these are encoded by multi drug resistance conjugative plasmids. the present study was  undertaken to study the incidence of multi drug resistant and es beta l producing klebsiella spp. in children under five years of age suffering from intestinal and extraintestinal infections. methods: a total of 90 strains of klebsiella spp. (76 isolates of k. pneumoniae and 14 of k. oxytoca) were tested for resistance to 3gc antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), amikacin, ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamycin and streptomycin by disc diffusion method. isolates found resistant to 3gc antibiotics were tested for the production of es beta l by double disc diffusion synergy test. transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and es beta l production from klebsiella isolates to an esch. coli strain (k12 j62-2). results: all the 90 isolates showed multi drug resistance; 87 (96.6%) isolates showed resistance or decreased susceptibility to at least one of the three 3gc. es beta l production was detected in four strains of k. pneumoniae and two k. oxytoca. es beta l activity  could be experimentally transferred to recipient esch. coli in all the 6 isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was co-transferred along with resistance to gentamycin. interpretation & conclusion: this study has shown the incidence of es beta l producing klebsiella strains in children in chennai, and possibly poses a threat in the treatment and management of klebsiella associated  infections. the incidence of es beta l producing strains of klebsiella and other  members of enterobacteriaceae should be carefully monitored in children to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics especially 3gc and aminoglycoside antibiotics. hence, tests for the detection of es beta l producing klebsiella strains should be carried out routinely for better therapeutic management.

TI  == rapd typing of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates using standardized reagents.
AB  == objective: to perform quality assessment of standardized random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis for epidemiologic typing of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. methods:  thirty k. pneumoniae, 15 k. oxytoca, 30 s. marcescens and 33 p. aeruginosa epidemiologically unrelated isolates and four collections of clinically related isolates of each species were included in the study. rapd analysis was performed  using ready-to-go rapd analysis beads with primer eric-1r and ready-to-go primer  2 for k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, primer set eric-2/1026 and ready-to-go primer 2 for s. marcescens, and primers d-10514 and d-14306 for p. aeruginosa. results:  all epidemiologically unrelated k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca isolates were distinguished. twenty-nine types were distinguished among the 30 unrelated s. marcescens isolates and 32 types among the 33 unrelated p. aeruginosa isolates. indistinguishable banding patterns were obtained in repeated analyses of two isolates and from 11 serial subcultures of three isolates of each species included in the study. the rapd data from the clinically related isolates correlated with the epidemiologic origin of the isolates. conclusions: the use of ready-to-go rapd analysis beads resulted in reproducible and stable banding patterns with a high discriminatory capacity, and the rapd typing results corresponded with the epidemiologic origin of the isolates.

AB  == the cellular and lipopolysaccharide (lps) fatty acid compositions of the type strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. terrigena, k. planticola, and "k. trevisanii" were studied. the cellular fatty acids of klebsiellae were presented by straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated, cyclopropane, and hydroxy fatty acids. hexadecanoic, methylenehexadecanoic, octadecenoic and hexadecenoic acids prevailed. the k. pneumoniae strain mainly differed from the strains of other species by two and more times lower level of dodecanoic acid in  cells. variations of cyclopropane and unsaturated fatty acid contents in cells were observed. lps fatty acids profiles of klebsiellae mainly consisted of straight-chain saturated and hydroxy fatty acids with predominance of tetradecanoic and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acids. lps fatty acids profiles of k. oxytoca, k. terrigena, k. planticola, and "k. trevisanii" strains were very similar and differed from that of the k. pneumoniae strain by higher levels of dodecanoic acid (approximately 5-6 times) and absence of 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. the obtained data indicated more close relatedness of k. oxytoca, k. terrigena, and k. planticola and some their remoteness from k. pneumoniae.

TI  == betalasen: microdilution panel for identifying beta-lactamases present in isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a dried investigational use-only microdilution panel named betalasen (a short named derived from the panel's purpose, to identify beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae) containing 10 beta-lactam drugs with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors was developed to identify beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii group, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. the mics obtained with a collection of 383 organisms containing well-characterized beta-lactamases were used to develop numeric codes and logic pathways for computerized analysis of results. the resultant logic pathways and betalasen panel were then used to test and identify beta-lactamases among 885 isolates of enterobacteriaceae recovered in cultures obtained at six different hospital laboratories across the united states. beta-lactamases present in 801 (90.5%) of the 885 isolates were identified by betalasen by using the existing logic pathways and codes or after minor modifications were made to the existing codes. the 84 strains that gave codes that betalasen could not identify were collected, reidentified, and retested by using betalasen. three strains had been  misidentified, 54 strains gave different codes upon repeat testing that could be  identified by betalasen, and 27 strains repeated new codes. the beta-lactamases in these strains were identified, and the new codes were added to the betalasen logic pathways. these results indicate that betalasen can identify clinically important beta-lactamases among most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the results  also show that good quality control and attention to proper performance of the tests are essential to the correct performance of betalasen.

TI  == multiplex pcr for detection of enterobacteriaceae in blood.
AB  == background: rapid and sensitive methods are needed to detect the small numbers of bacteria that may sometimes contaminate units of blood during collection. a multiplex 5'-nuclease taqman pcr assay (pe applied biosystems) was used to detect several bacterial species that may contaminate blood. study design and methods: oligonucleotide primers were made for regions of the 16s rrna gene conserved in four different bacterial species: yersinia enterocolitica and serratia, klebsiella, and enterobacter species. two probes were designed: sl-1 detected serratia, klebsiella, and enterobacter species, and ye-3 detected y. enterocolitica. results: when taqman pcr was performed with chromosomal dna isolated from pure cultures of serratia liquefaciens, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans, the limit of detection with probe sl-1 was 1 to 2 cfus. for s. marcescens, the sensitivity was 8 cfus. the limit of detection for y. enterocolitica with probe ye-3 was 2 cfus. when total chromosomal dna was extracted from whole-blood samples spiked with different numbers of y. enterocolitica, s. liquefaciens, e. cloacae, or k. pneumoniae bacteria, the taqman pcr detected 12 to 16 organisms in 1 ml of blood. conclusion: the 5'-nuclease taqman pcr assay takes only 3 hours to perform and has the potential to detect very small numbers of bacteria.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: epidemiology, detection, and treatment.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are extremely broad spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes found in a variety of enterobacteriaceae. most strains producing these beta-lactamases are klebsiella pneumoniae, other klebsiella species (i.e., k. oxytoca), and escherichia coli. when producing these enzymes, organisms become highly effective at inactivating various beta-lactam antibiotics. in addition, esbl-producing bacteria are frequently resistant to many classes of antibiotics, resulting in difficult-to-treat infections. other problems due to esbl-producing bacteria are difficulty in detecting the presence  of esbls, limited treatment options, and deleterious impact on clinical outcomes. clinicians should be familiar with the clinical significance of these enzymes and potential strategies for dealing with this growing problem.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae from 19 laboratories using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection methods.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) are enzymes found in gram-negative bacilli that mediate resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. in 1999, the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) published methods for screening and confirming the presence of esbls in klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and escherichia coli. to evaluate the  confirmation protocol, we tested 139 isolates of k. pneumoniae that were sent to  project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology) from 19 hospitals in 11 u.s. states. each isolate met the nccls screening criteria for potential esbl producers (ceftazidime [caz] or cefotaxime [ctx] mics were > or =2 microg/ml for all isolates). initially, 117 (84%) isolates demonstrated a clavulanic acid (ca) effect by disk diffusion (i.e., an increase in caz or ctx zone diameters of > or =5 mm in the presence of ca), and 114 (82%) demonstrated a ca effect by broth microdilution (reduction of caz or ctx mics by > or =3 dilutions). for five isolates, a ca effect could not be determined initially by broth microdilution because of off-scale caz results. however, a ca effect was observed in two of these isolates by testing cefepime and cefepime plus ca. the cefoxitin mics for 23 isolates that failed to show a ca effect by broth microdilution were > or =32 microg/ml, suggesting either the presence of an ampc-type beta-lactamase or porin changes that could mask a ca effect. by isoelectric focusing (ief), 7 of the 23 isolates contained a beta-lactamase with  a pi of > or =8.3 suggestive of an ampc-type beta-lactamase; 6 of the 7 isolates  were shown by pcr to contain both ampc-type and bla(oxa) genes. the ief profiles  of the remaining 16 isolates showed a variety of beta-lactamase bands, all of which had pis of < or =7.5. all 16 isolates were negative by pcr with multiple primer sets for ampc-type, bla(oxa), and bla(ctx-m) genes. in summary, 83.5% of the k. pneumoniae isolates that were identified initially as presumptive esbl producers were positive for a ca effect, while 5.0% contained beta-lactamases that likely masked the ca effect. the remaining 11.5% of the isolates studied contained beta-lactamases that did not demonstrate a ca effect. an algorithm based on phenotypic analyses is suggested for evaluation of such isolates.

AB  == is1397 and iskpn1 are is3 family members which are specifically inserted into the loop of palindromic units (pus). is1397 is shown to transpose into pus with sequences close or identical to the escherichia coli consensus, even in other enterobacteria (salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca). moreover, we show that homologous intergenic regions containing pus constitute is1397 transpositional hot spots, despite bacterial interspersed mosaic element structures that differ among the three species. iskpn1, described here for the first time, is specific for pus from k. pneumoniae, in which we discovered it. a sequence comparison between the two insertion sequences allowed us to define a motif possibly accounting for their specificity.

AB  == the phylogenetic relationships of the type strains of 9 klebsiella species and 20 species from 11 genera of the family enterobacteriaceae were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the 16s rrna and rpob genes. the sequence data were phylogenetically analysed by the neighbourjoining and parsimony methods. the phylogenetic inference of the sequence comparison confirmed that the genus klebsiella is heterogeneous and composed of species which form three clusters that also included members of other genera, including enterobacter aerogenes, erwinia clusters i and ii and tatumella. cluster i contained the type strains of klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae. cluster ii contained klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella planticola, klebsiella trevisanii and klebsiella terrigena, organisms characterized by growth at 10 degrees c and utilization of l-sorbose as carbon source. cluster iii contained klebsiella oxytoca. the data from the sequence analyses along with previously reported biochemical and dna-dna hybridization data support the division of the genus klebsiella into two genera and one genogroup. the name raoultella is proposed as a genus name for species of cluster ii and emended definitions of klebsiella species are proposed.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolates revealed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna, gyra and parc genes sequencing and automated ribotyping.
AB  == the infra-specific phylogenetic diversity and genetic structure of both klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca was investigated using a combination of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis, sequencing of gyra and parc genes, and automated ribotyping. after rapd analysis with four independent primers of 120 clinical isolates collected from 22 european hospitals in 13 countries, k. pneumoniae isolates fell into three clusters and k. oxytoca isolates fell into two clusters, while klebsiella planticola isolates formed a sixth cluster. each cluster was geographically widespread. k. pneumoniae cluster  i (kpi) accounted for 80% of the isolates of this species and included reference  strains of the three subspecies k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis. clusters kpii and kpiii were equally represented, as were the two k. oxytoca clusters. individualization  of each cluster was fully confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of gyra and parc gene sequences. in addition, sequence data supported the evolutionary separation  of k. pneumoniae from a phylogenetic group including k. oxytoca, klebsiella terrigena, k. planticola and klebsiella ornithinolytica. automated ribotyping using mlu i appeared suitable for identification of each klebsiella cluster. the  adonitol fermentation test was found to be useful for cluster identification in k. pneumoniae, since it was negative in all strains of clusters kpiii and in some kpii strains, but always positive in cluster kpi. the usefulness of gyra and parc sequence data for population genetics and cluster identification in bacteria was  demonstrated, even for the phylogenetic positioning of quinolone-resistant isolates.

TI  == primers and a specific dna probe for detecting lactic acid bacteria producing 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde from glycerol in spoiled ciders.
AB  == of the 40 strains isolated from several spoiled ciders where glycerol was degraded, 36 were identified as lactobacillus collinoides, three were lactobacillus hilgardii, and one was lactobacillus mali. however, only 30 l. collinoides and two l. hilgardii could degrade glycerol. the glycerol dehydratase activity was shown. the main product of the transformation was 1.3 propanediol. two dna primers gd1 and gd2 were chosen in the region encoding one of the subunits of glycerol dehydratase of citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae,  klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium pasteurianum. a 279-bp amplicon in polymerase chain reaction amplification was obtained with the  genomic l. collinoides ioeb 9527 dna as template. the amino acid sequence deduced from the amplicon dna sequence showed a very high similarity and identity with the gene of gram-negative and c. pasteurianum species. after labeling, the amplicon was used as dna probe in dot-blot hybridization with the genomic dna of  all the tested strains. only strains that could degrade glycerol hybridized. moreover, polymerase chain reactions using gdi and gd2 revealed only glycerol dehydratase genes of positive l. collinoides and l. hilgardii strains. the primers and the amplicon proved to be suitable and reliable tools to detect the lactic acid bacteria involved in the deterioration of cider.

TI  == the in vitro effect of imipenem and ofloxacin on enzymic activity of klebsiella strains.
AB  == fifty seven klebsiella strains, viz. k. pneumoniae (28), k. planticola (19), k. oxytoca (6), k. ornithinolytica (3) and k. terrigena (1) possessed lipolytic and  urealytic activity. the effect of imipenem and ofloxacin at subinhibitory concentrations (sub-mics) on these enzymic activities of 4 strains was studied. at all the concentrations tested (mainly at 1/4 of the mics) imipenem enhanced lipase activity manifested by cleavage of the substrate tween 20. the effect of ofloxacin was strain- and concentration-dependent but in most cases lipolytic activity was also increased. the antibiotics practically did not affect the urease activity of the strains.

TI  == klebsiella brain abscess in adults.
AB  == background: we analyzed the clinical manifestations and therapeutic outcomes of klebsiella brain abscesses. patients and methods: the clinical data of 15 patients with klebsiella brain abscesses, retrospectively collected over a 14-year period, were studied. results: the 15 patients included 13 cases of klebsiella pneumoniae infection and two cases of klebsiella oxytoca. all but one  case were community-acquired infections. locations of all of these abscesses were supratentorial. 12 cases involved a single abscess, and three involved multiple abscesses. gas formation was also found in two cases (13%). common predisposing factors included metastatic spread, chronic otitis media and neurosurgical procedures. among these 15 patients, 11 were treated surgically and four received antibiotics alone. in total, 11 patients survived and four died, with an overall  mortality rate of 26.7%. conclusion: the clinical presentations and therapeutic outcomes varied according to the different klebsiella species. while debilitating diseases were common in k. pneumoniae infections, they were not common in k. oxytoca infection. and while metastatic septic abscess is a well-known, devastating complication of k. pneumoniae septicemia, usually seen as a brain abscess with a gas-forming appearance, all of these k. oxytoca infections had both otogenic infections and more favorable outcomes.

TI  == natural antibiotic susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. planticola, k. ornithinolytica and k. terrigena strains.
AB  == the natural susceptibility of 221 klebsiella strains to 71 antibiotics was examined. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and the environment,  and belonged to k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (n = 40), k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae (37), k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis (10), k. oxytoca (44), k. planticola (40), k. ornithinolytica (25) and k. terrigena (25). mic values were determined by a microdilution procedure in isosensitest broth according to the german standard (din). all klebsiella spp. were naturally resistant or intermediate to amoxicillin, ticarcillin and to antibiotics to which other enterobacteriaceae are also intrinsically resistant. klebsiella spp. were naturally sensitive or intermediate to several penicillins, all tested cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin. k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and subsp. rhinoscleromatis strains were generally more susceptible to antibiotics than strains of other klebsiella taxa. k pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis was the most susceptible taxon, being highly susceptible to cefuroxime, anti-folates and naturally intermediate to erythromycin and clarithromycin. k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae was most susceptible to glycopeptides. k. oxytoca and k. terrigena strains were least susceptible to cefazoline, cefoperazone and fosfomycin, respectively. the results of the present study describe a database of the natural antimicrobial susceptibility of klebsiella spp., which can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility results of these bacteria. mic patterns to beta-lactams indicate the expression of chromosomally encoded class a gamma-lactamases in all the species, including the subspecies of k. pneumoniae. similar natural susceptibility patterns of k. planticola and k. ornithinolytica to all tested antibiotics support the status of k. ornithinolytica as a biovar of k. planticola.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  == background: infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. knowledge of their occurrence  and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. we performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. objective: to delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. methods: children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. results: seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (tbsa), burn 15%]. twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis,  6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13  involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia,  2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by cdc criteria no organism was recovered. organisms causing infection were: staphylococcus aureus, 19; candida albicans, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 4; enterococcus sp., 3; escherichia coli, 1; klebsiella oxytoca,  1; serratia marcescens, 1; streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; streptococcus pyogenes, 1; aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and candida parapsilosis, 1. burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (tbsa >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors  for infection; young age and site of burn were not. conclusion: the most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. children with flame and inhalation injury, tbsa burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.

TI  == specificities of reactivating factors for adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase.
AB  == adenosylcobalamin-dependent glycerol and diol dehydratases undergo inactivation by the physiological substrate glycerol during catalysis. in the permeabilized cells of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and recombinant escherichia coli, glycerol-inactivated glycerol dehydratase and diol dehydratase are reactivated by their respective reactivating factors in the presence of atp, mg2+, and adenosylcobalamin. both of the reactivating factors consist of two subunits. to examine the specificities of the reactivating factors, their genes or their hybrid genes were co-expressed with dehydratase genes in e. coli cells in various combinations. the reactivating factor of k. oxytoca for diol dehydratase efficiently cross-reactivated the inactivated glycerol dehydratase, whereas the reactivating factor of k. pneumoniae for glycerol dehydratase hardly  cross-reactivated the inactivated diol dehydratase. both of the two hybrid reactivating factors rapidly reactivated the inactivated glycerol dehydratase. in contrast, the hybrid reactivating factor containing the large subunit of the glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor hardly reactivated the inactivated diol  dehydratase. these results indicate that the glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor is much more specific for the dehydratase partner than the diol dehydratase reactivating factor and that a large subunit of the reactivating factors principally determines the specificity for a dehydratase.

TI  == pathways for the utilization of n-acetyl-galactosamine and galactosamine in escherichia coli.
AB  == among enteric bacteria, the ability to grow on n-acetyl-galactosamine (galnac or  aga) and on d-galactosamine (galn or gam) differs. thus, strains b, c and ec3132  of escherichia coli are aga+ gam+ whereas e. coli k-12 is aga- gam-, similarly to klebsiella pneumoniae kay2026, klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and salmonella typhimurium lt2. the former strains carry a complete aga/kba gene cluster at 70.5 min of their gene map. these genes encode an aga-specific phosphotransferase system (pts) or iiaga (agavwe) and a galn-specific pts or iigam (agabcd). both ptss belong to the mannose-sorbose family, i.e. the iib, iic and iid domains are encoded by different genes, and they share a iia domain (agaf). furthermore, the  genes encode an aga6p-deacetylase (agaa), a galn6p deaminase (agai), a tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase comprising two different peptides (kbayz) and a putative isomerase (agas), i.e. complete pathways for the transport and degradation of both amino sugars. the genes are organized in two adjacent operons (kbazagavwefa and agas kbayagabcdi) and controlled by a repressor agar. its gene  agar is located upstream of kbaz, and agar responds to galnac and galn in the medium. all aga- gam- strains, however, carry a deletion covering genes agaw' ef  'a; consequently they lack active iiaga and iigam ptss, thus explaining their inability to grow on the two amino sugars. remnants of a putative recombination site flank the deleted dna in the various aga- gam- enteric bacteria. derivatives with an aga+ gam- phenotype can be isolated from e. coli k-12. these retain the deltaagaw' ef 'a deletion and carry suppressor mutations in the gat and nag genes for galactitol and n-acetyl-glucosamine metabolism, respectively, that allow growth on aga but not on galn.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == a novel complex mutant beta-lactamase, tem-68, identified in a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from an outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiellae.
AB  == twenty-two klebsiella pneumoniae and two k. oxytoca extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates were collected in 1996 from patients in  two pediatric wards of the university hospital in wroclaw, poland. molecular typing has revealed that the k. pneumoniae isolates represented four different epidemic strains. three kinds of enzymes with esbl activity (pi values of 5.7, 6.0, and 8.2) were identified. the pi 6.0 beta-lactamases belonged to the tem family, and sequencing of the bla(tem) genes amplified from representative isolates revealed that these enzymes were tem-47, previously identified in k. pneumoniae isolates from pediatric hospitals in lodz and warsaw. one of the tem-47-producing strains from wroclaw was very closely related to the isolates from the other cities, and this indicated countrywide spread of the epidemic strain. the pi 5.7 beta-lactamase was produced by a single k. pneumoniae isolate  for which, apart from oxyimino-beta-lactams, the mics of beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations were also remarkably high. sequencing revealed that this was a novel tem beta-lactamase variant, tem-68, specified by the following combination of mutations: gly238ser, glu240lys, thr265met, and arg275leu. the new enzyme has most probably evolved from tem-47 by acquiring the single substitution of arg275, which before was identified only twice in enzymes with inhibitor resistance (ir)  activity. tem-68 was shown to be a novel complex mutant tem beta-lactamase (cmt-2) which combines strong esbl activity with relatively weak ir activity and, when expressed in k. pneumoniae, is able to confer high-level resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactams, including inhibitor combinations. this data confirms the role of the arg275leu mutation in determining ir activity and documents the first isolation of k. pneumoniae producing the complex mutant enzyme.

TI  == domain structure of secretin puld revealed by limited proteolysis and electron microscopy.
AB  == secretins, a superfamily of multimeric outer membrane proteins, mediate the transport of large macromolecules across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. limited proteolysis of secretin puld from the klebsiella oxytoca pullulanase secretion pathway showed that it consists of an n-terminal domain and a protease-resistant c-terminal domain that remains multimeric after proteolysis. the stable c-terminal domain starts just before the region in puld that is highly conserved in the secretin superfamily and apparently lacks the region at the c-terminal end to which the secretin-specific pilot protein puls binds. electron  microscopy showed that the stable fragment produced by proteolysis is composed of two stacked rings that encircle a central channel and that it lacks the peripheral radial spokes that are seen in the native complex. moreover, the electron microscopic images suggest that the n-terminal domain folds back into the large cavity of the channel that is formed by the c-terminal domain of the native complex, thereby occluding the channel, consistent with previous electrophysiological studies showing that the channel is normally closed.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin resistance among clinical isolates of enterobacteria in a danish region.
AB  == the susceptibility of enterobacteria to gentamicin was studied in the county of north jutland during 1993-1998. a total of 378 patients had a first-time gentamicin-resistant isolate. the annual number rose from 34 patients in 1993 to  89 in 1998. the prevalence of resistance per 1000 patients with isolates examined was 13.5 for escherichia coli, 15.8 for klebsiella pneumoniae, 26.1 for klebsiella oxytoca, and 150.4 for citrobacter freundii. e. coli accounted for 67% of gentamicin-resistant isolates. k. oxytoca was probably associated with a nosocomial epidemic, whereas a source for c. freundii remained unresolved. an analysis confined to e. coli identified specimens other than urine as risk factors for gentamicin resistance. likewise, resistance to sulfonamides and to fluoroquinolones were strong risk factors for gentamicin resistance among urinary isolates of e. coli. thus, it is likely that aminoglycoside resistance may be promoted by other antibiotic groups due to co-resistance. the therapeutic and prophylactic uses of aminoglycosides have as yet not been undermined, but continuous population-based surveillance and vigilance are recommended.

TI  == multiple interactions between pullulanase secreton components involved in stabilization and cytoplasmic membrane association of pule.
AB  == we report attempts to analyze interactions between components of the pullulanase  (pul) secreton (type ii secretion machinery) from klebsiella oxytoca encoded by a multiple-copy-number plasmid in escherichia coli. three of the 15 pul proteins (b, h, and n) were found to be dispensable for pullulanase secretion. the following evidence leads us to propose that pule, pull, and pulm form a subcomplex with which pulc and pulg interact. the integral cytoplasmic membrane protein pull prevented proteolysis and/or aggregation of pule and mediated its association with the cytoplasmic membrane. the cytoplasmic, n-terminal domain of  pull interacted directly with pule, and both pulc and pulm were required to prevent proteolysis of pull. pulm and pull could be cross-linked as a heterodimer whose formation in a strain producing the secreton required pulg. however, pull and pulm produced alone could also be cross-linked in a 52-kda complex, indicating that the secreton exerts subtle effects on the interaction between pule and pull. antibodies against pulm coimmunoprecipitated pull, pulc, and pule  from detergent-solubilized cell extracts, confirming the existence of a complex containing these four proteins. overproduction of pulg, which blocks secretion, drastically reduced the cellular levels of pulc, pule, pull, and pulm as well as  puld (secretin), which probably interacts with pulc. the pul secreton components  e, f, g, i, j, k, l, and m could all be replaced by the corresponding components  of the out secretons of erwinia chrysanthemi and erwinia carotovora, showing that they do not play a role in secretory protein recognition and secretion specificity.

AB  == escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. were screened for esbl based on routine susceptibility testing results. isolates with intermediate or resistant susceptibilities for extended spectrum cephalosporins or aztreonam were reported  as probable esbl producers. by using the nccls proposed esbl confirmatory method, we tested 61 screen-positive isolates from 42 patients, 30 randomly selected susceptible isolates, and 12 isolates with previously characterized beta-lactamases. ceftazidime contributed to 97% of screen-positive isolates, whereas aztreonam added a single patient isolate. an esbl was confirmed in 86% of k. pneumoniae, 100% of k. oxytoca, and 20% of e. coli screen-positive single patient isolates. none of the susceptible isolates were shown to produce esbl. based on these findings a comment regarding the presence of esbl seems sufficient for klebsiella spp. but confirmatory testing is indicated for e. coli. 0.25 microg/ml was used to indicate the presence of esbl, the specificity of the assay increased to 100%. the nccls esbl phenotypic confirmatory method was reproducible and accurate enough to be used in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == detection, prevalence, purification and characterization of lecithinase of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == lecithinase activity in klebsiella is a rare trait as out of 208 strains of klebsiella belonging to 3 species, viz. k. pneumoniae (168), k. planticola (29) and k. oxytoca (11), only 4 strains of k. pneumoniae produced lecithinase positive colonies on egg-yolk-agar. although cell lysates of 16 k. pneumoniae yielded positive results for lecithinase assay on egg-yolk-agar, 19 strains were  detected positive for lecithinase with elisa using anti-lecithinase serum. release of up to 52.12% cell-bound lecithinase could be achieved with polymyxin-b treatment at 100 micrograms/ml concentration. purified lecithinase was determined to be a high molecular weight (70 kda), crystalizable, anionic (pi, 3.5) protein. it possessed cytolytic, haemolytic and dermonecrotic activities but did not induce fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop or infant mouse guts. it was inactivated by boiling, trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment and alkaline ph. serologically, it was related to lecithinase of aeromonas caviae and phospholipase-c of salmonella.

TI  == the yersinia high-pathogenicity island is present in different members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a pathogenicity island termed high-pathogenicity island (hpi) is present in pathogenic yersinia. this 35 to 45 kb island carries genes involved in synthesis, regulation and transport of the siderophore yersiniabactin. recently, the hpi was also detected in various strains of escherichia coli. in this study, the distribution of the hpi in the family enterobacteriaceae was investigated. among  the 67 isolates pertaining to 18 genera and 52 species tested, nine (13.4%) harbored the island. these isolates were three e. coli, one citrobacter diversus  and five klebsiella of various species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, klebsiella ozaenae, klebsiella planticola, and klebsiella oxytoca). as in yersinia sp., all nine isolates synthesized the hpi-encoded iron-repressible proteins hmwp1 and hmwp2. in the k. oxytoca strain, the right-end portion of the hpi was deleted, whereas the entire core region of the island was present in the eight other enterobacteria strains analyzed. in most of these isolates, the hpi was bordered by an asn trna locus, as in yersinia sp. this report thus demonstrates the spread of the hpi among various members of the  family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == general nitrogen regulation of nitrate assimilation regulatory gene nasr expression in klebsiella oxytoca m5al.
AB  == klebsiella oxytoca can assimilate nitrate and nitrite by using enzymes encoded by the nasfedcba operon. expression of the nasf operon is controlled by general nitrogen regulation (ntr) via the ntrc transcription activator and by pathway-specific nitrate and nitrite induction via the nasr transcription antiterminator. this paper reports our analysis of nasr gene expression. we constructed strains bearing single-copy phi(nasr-lacz) operon fusions within the  chromosomal rhabad-rhasr locus. the expression of deltarhabs::[phi(nasr-lacz)] operon fusions was induced about 10-fold during nitrogen-limited growth. induction was reduced in both ntrc and rpon null mutants, indicating that ntr control of nasr gene expression requires the ntrc and sigma(n) (sigma(54)) proteins. sequence inspection of the nasr control region reveals an apparent sigma(n)-dependent promoter but no apparent ntrc protein binding sites. analysis  of site-specific mutations coupled with primer extension analysis authenticated the sigma(n)-dependent nasr promoter. fusion constructs with only about 70 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the transcription initiation site exhibited patterns of beta-galactosidase expression indistinguishable from phi(nasr-lacz) constructs with about 470 nt upstream. expression was independent of the nac protein, implying that ntrc is a direct activator of nasr transcription. together, these results indicate that nasr gene expression does not require specific upstream ntrc-binding sequences, as previously noted for argt gene expression in salmonella typhimurium (g. schmitz, k. nikaido, and g. f.-l. ames, mol. gen. genet. 215:107-117, 1988).

TI  == genetic dissection of the outer membrane secretin puld: are there distinct domains for multimerization and secretion specificity?
AB  == linker and deletion mutagenesis and gene fusions were used to probe the possible  domain structure of the dodecameric outer membrane secretin puld from the pullulanase secretion pathway of klebsiella oxytoca. insertions of 24 amino acids close to or within strongly predicted and highly conserved amphipathic beta strands in the c-terminal half of the polypeptide (the beta domain) abolished sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-resistant multimer formation that is characteristic  of this protein, whereas insertions elsewhere generally had less dramatic effects on multimer formation. however, the beta domain alone did not form sds-resistant  multimers unless part of the n-terminal region of the protein (the n domain) was  produced in trans. all of the insertions except one, close to the c terminus of the protein, abolished function. the n domain alone was highly unstable and did not form sds-resistant multimers even when the beta domain was present in trans.  we conclude that the beta domain is a major determinant of multimer stability and that the n domain contributes to multimer formation. the entire or part of the n  domain of puld could be replaced by the corresponding region of the outd secretin from the pectate lyase secretion pathway of erwinia chrysanthemi without abolishing pullulanase secretion. this suggests that the n domain of puld is not  involved in substrate recognition, contrary to the role proposed for the n domain of outd, which binds specifically to pectate lyase secreted by e. chrysanthemi (v. e. shevchik, j. robert-badouy, and g. condemine, embo j. 16:3007-3016, 1997).

TI  == the genetic structure of enteric bacteria from australian mammals.
AB  == a total of 246 isolates representing five species of the family enterobacteriaceae, taken from a variety of australian mammal species, were characterized using multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis. genome diversity estimates varied significantly among species, with the klebsiella pneumoniae sample exhibiting the lowest diversity and the citrobacter freundii sample the highest. multi-locus linkage disequilibrium estimates revealed that alleles were  non-randomly associated in all five species samples, but the magnitude of the estimates differed significantly among species. escherichia coli had the lowest linkage disequilibrium estimate and klebisella oxytoca the largest. molecular analyis of variance was used to determine the extent to which population structure explained the observed genetic variation in a species. two population levels were defined: the taxonomic family of the host from which the isolate was  collected and the geographical locality where the host was collected. the amount  of explained variation varied from 0% for k. oxytoca to 22% for k. pneumoniae. host locality explained a significant amount of the genetic variation in the c. freundii (12%), e. coli (5%), hafnia alvei (17%) and k. pneumoniae (22%) samples. host family explained a significant fraction of the variation in e. coli (6%) h.  alvei (7%) and k. pneumoniae (20%). estimates of effective population size for all five species, based on the probability that two randomly chosen isolates will be identical, failed to reveal any relationship between the effective population  size and the genetic diversity of a species.

TI  == the distribution of enteric bacteria from australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  == bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout australia. escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. association analysis revealed that most  other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which e. coli was present. the composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. hosts collected from the northern areas of queensland and the northern territory had more diverse enteric  communities than hosts collected from new south wales or western australia. hosts of the families petauridae and vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the macropodidae or phalangeridae. the probability of occurrence of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. the non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to find out whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as) carry fecal klebsiella strains that belong to serotypes or species specific for as. somatic serotypes (o groups), capsular (k) serotypes, and biochemically identified species were determined for fecal klebsiellae isolated from 187 as patients and 195 control patients. the controls were patients with fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis. the 638 isolates of klebsiella that were obtained represented 161 strains; 81 from as patients and 80 from the controls. the average number of klebsiella strains per patient was 1.7 for the as group and 1.5 for the control group. the most common o group was o1, which was observed for isolates from 23 of 187 as patients and 24 of 195 control  patients. next in frequency was group o2, which was observed for isolates from 17 as patients and 15 control patients. regarding the k serotypes, 59 different types were identified, revealing a heterogeneous representation of klebsiella strains, without a predominance of any serotype. by biochemical identification, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently occurring species, being found in 45 as patients and 45 control patients. next in the frequency was k. oxytoca, which was observed in 26 as patients and in 29 control patients. k. planticola and k. terrigena occurred in only a minority of patients. altogether, when analyzed either separately or simultaneously according to o groups, k serotypes,  and biochemically identified species, no evidence of the existence of as-specific klebsiella strains was obtained. these findings do not indicate participation of  klebsiella in the etiopathogenesis of as.

TI  == secretin puld: association with pilot puls, structure, and ion-conducting channel formation.
AB  == the outer membrane protein puld (secretin) of klebsiella oxytoca is required for  transport of pullulanase across this membrane. we have purified a multimeric puld complex from an escherichia coli strain expressing all the proteins involved in pullulanase secretion. the outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein puls was found to  copurify with puld. the molar ratio of the two proteins is close to 1:1, and the  size of the complex is approximately 1 mda. scanning transmission electron and cryo-electron microscopy analyses showed that the purified complex is a cylindrical structure having a central cavity of approximately 7.6 nm and peripheral radial spokes. fusion of proteoliposomes containing the purified complex with a planar lipid bilayer resulted in the appearance of small, voltage-activated, ion-conducting channels. we conclude that the central cavity seen in the electron microscope is part of a large gated channel and propose that the observed current fluctuations correspond to voltage-induced, relatively minor displacements of domains in the purified complex rather than to a complete opening of the secretin channel.

TI  == membrane association and multimerization of secreton component pulc.
AB  == the pulc component of the klebsiella oxytoca pullulanase secretion machinery (the secreton) was found by subcellular fractionation to be associated with both the cytoplasmic (inner) and outer membranes. association with the outer membrane was  independent of other secreton components, including the outer membrane protein puld (secretin). the association of pulc with the inner membrane is mediated by the signal anchor sequence located close to its n terminus. these results suggest that pulc forms a bridge between the two membranes that is disrupted when bacteria are broken open for fractionation. neither the signal anchor sequence nor the cytoplasmic n-terminal region that precedes it was found to be required for pulc function, indicating that pulc does not undergo sequence-specific interactions with other cytoplasmic membrane proteins. cross-linking of whole cells resulted in the formation of a ca. 110-kda band that reacted with pulc-specific serum and whose detection depended on the presence of puld. however, antibodies against puld failed to react with this band, suggesting that  it could be a homo-pulc trimer whose formation requires puld. the data are discussed in terms of the possible role of pulc in energy transduction for exoprotein secretion.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == plasmid ptkh11, originally obtained by electroporation of a klebsiella oxytoca plasmid preparation into escherichia coli xac, expressed a high level of an ampc-like beta-lactamase. the enzyme, designated cmy-5, conferred resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams in e. coli; nevertheless, the phenotype was cryptic in the k. oxytoca donor. determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of ptkh11 revealed that the 8,193-bp plasmid encoded seven open reading  frames, including that for the cmy-5 beta-lactamase (blacmy-5). the blacmy-5 product was similar to the plasmidic cmy-2 beta-lactamase of k. pneumoniae and the chromosomal ampc of citrobacter freundii, with 99.7 and 97.0% identities, respectively; there was a substitution of phenylalanine in cmy-5 for isoleucine 105 in cmy-2. blacmy-5 was followed by the blc and suge genes of c. freundii, and this cluster exhibited a genetic organization identical to that of the ampc region on the chromosome of c. freundii; these results confirmed that c. freundii ampc was the evolutionary origin of the plasmidic cephamycinases. in the k. oxytoca host, the copy number of ptkh11 was very low and the plasmid coexisted with plasmid pnbl63. analysis of the replication regions of the two plasmids revealed 97% sequence similarity in the rna i transcripts; this result implied that the two plasmids might be incompatible. incompatibility of the two plasmids  might explain the cryptic phenotype of blacmy-5 in k. oxytoca through an exclusion effect on ptkh11 by resident plasmid pnbl63.

TI  == recombinant klebsiella oxytoca strains with improved efficiency in removal of high nitrate loads
AB  == klebsiella oxytoca cect 4460 removes high nitrate loads from industrial wastewaters without accumulation of nitrite under optimal culture conditions; however, under nonoptimal conditions nitrite accumulates. this situation reflects an in vivo-limited functioning of nitrite reductase in this strain. as a way to overcome this limitation, an increase in the nitrite reductase gene dose in k. oxytoca cect 4460 was considered. to achieve this, we cloned and transferred into this strain the klebsiella pneumoniae nasb gene, which encodes assimilatory nitrite reductase (lin et al., j. bacteriol. 176:2551-2559, 1994). the delivery vector was either the wide-host-range plasmid pupe2, in which the nasb gene is expressed from the escherichia coli plac promoter, or a mini-tn5-km vector, which upon random insertion in the host chromosome allowed expression of the nasb gene  from an unidentified chromosomal host promoter. the effect of the increase in the dose of the nasb gene in k. oxytoca cect 4460 on the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium was tested in two recombinant strains. the results obtained showed that k. oxytoca cect 4460 bearing pupe2 accumulated 88% less nitrite than  the wild-type strain, while the recombinant strain bearing the k. pneumoniae nasb gene in the host chromosome showed a 25% lower level of nitrite accumulation in the culture medium than that of the wild type.

TI  == nasr, a novel rna-binding protein, mediates nitrate-responsive transcription antitermination of the klebsiella oxytoca m5al nasf operon leader in vitro.
AB  == in klebsiella oxytoca (pneumoniae), enzymes required for nitrate assimilation are encoded by the nasfedcba operon. previous genetic studies led to the conclusion that nitrate and nitrite induction of nasf operon expression is determined by a transcriptional antitermination mechanism. in the presence of nitrate or nitrite, the nasr gene product is hypothesized to inhibit transcription termination at the factor-independent terminator site located in the nasf operon leader region. to test this model in vitro, we first purified nasr as both a maltose binding protein fusion form (mbp-nasr) and a his6-tagged form (his6-nasr). templates for  in vitro transcription contained the nasf operon leader region, with a substitution of the sigma70-dependent tac promoter for the native sigman-dependent promoter. we found that in vitro transcription of the leader template terminated at the terminator site, and that mbp-nasr and his6-nasr proteins both caused transcription readthrough of this site in response to nitrate or nitrite. half-maximal antitermination required nitrate or nitrite at moderate (1 to 10 microm) concentrations, and several other anions tested, including chlorate, were without effect. previous in vivo analysis of leader deletions identified regions required for both negative regulation (the terminator) and for positive regulation. results from in vitro transcription of these deletion templates correlated fully with the in vivo analysis. finally, electrophoresis mobility shift analysis revealed that his6-nasr bound specifically to nasf leader rna. this binding was independent of nitrate in vitro. these results strongly support the conclusions drawn from previous in vivo analysis, and establish that nasr mediates ligand-responsive transcription antitermination through interaction with nasf leader rna.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == can results obtained with commercially available microscan microdilution panels serve as an indicator of beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli and klebsiella isolates with hidden resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam?
AB  == among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca, there is an ever-increasing prevalence of beta-lactamases that may confer resistance to newer beta-lactam antibiotics that is not detectable by conventional procedures. therefore, 75 isolates of these species producing well-characterized beta-lactamases were studied using two microscan conventional microdilution panels, gram negative urine mic 7 (nu7) and gram negative mic plus 2 (n+2), to determine if results could be utilized to provide an accurate indication of beta-lactamase production in the absence of frank resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. the enzymes studied included bush groups 1 (ampc), 2b (tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1), 2be (extended spectrum beta-lactamases [esbls] and k1), and 2br, alone and in various combinations. in tests with e. coli and k. pneumoniae and the nu7 panel, cefpodoxime mics of >/=2 microg/ml were obtained only for isolates producing esbls or ampc beta-lactamases. cefoxitin mics of >16 microg/ml were obtained for  all strains producing ampc beta-lactamase and only 1 of 33 strains producing esbls. for the n+2 panel, ceftazidime mics of >/=4 microg/ml correctly identified 90% of esbl producers and 100% of ampc producers among isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae. cefotetan mics of >/= 8 microg/ml were obtained for seven of eight producers of ampc beta-lactamase and no esbl producers. for tests performed with  either panel and isolates of k. oxytoca, mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftizoxime were elevated for strains producing esbls, while ceftriaxone and aztreonam mics separated low-level k1 from high-level k1 producers within this species. these results suggest that microdilution panels can be used by clinical  laboratories as an indicator of certain beta-lactamases that may produce hidden but clinically significant resistance among isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and k. oxytoca. although it may not always be possible to differentiate between strains that produce esbls and those that produce ampc, this differentiation is not critical since therapeutic options for patients infected with such organisms  are similarly limited.

TI  == characterization of the type 3 fimbrial adhesins of klebsiella strains.
AB  == the klebsiella pneumoniae fimbrial adhesin, mrkd, mediates adherence to the basolateral surfaces of renal and pulmonary epithelia and to the basement membranes of tissues. although all isolates possessing the mrkd adhesin mediate the agglutination, in vitro, of erythrocytes treated with tannic acid, the mrkd gene is not conserved within species. the ability of a plasmid-borne mrkd gene product to mediate binding to type v collagen is associated frequently with strains of k. oxytoca and rarely with strains of k. pneumoniae. in k. pneumoniae, the mrkd adhesin is located within a chromosomally borne gene cluster and mediates binding to collagen types iv and v. the plasmid-borne determinant, mrkd1p, and the chromosomally borne gene, mrkd1c, are not genetically related. some strains of enterobacteria possess a mrkd1c allele that is associated with hemagglutinating activity but does not bind to either type iv or type v collagen.

TI  == epidemiology of klebsiella bacteraemia: a case control study using escherichia coli bacteraemia as control.
AB  == epidemiological data from 117 episodes of klebsiella bacteraemia were compared with those from matched controls with escherichia coli bacteraemia. cases and controls were obtained from 20,631 blood cultures taken from patients in hvidovre hospital between 1990 and 1992. the data studied included: sex and age, risk factors, portal of entry, outcome, nosocomial acquisition and distribution within the hospital. the incidence of klebsiella bacteraemia was 9.3/10,000 admissions (76% klebsiella pneumoniae; 24% klebsiella oxytoca). patients with klebsiella and e. coli bacteraemia had many common features, including a high incidence of neoplastic disease, biliary tract disease, and renal failure. many had undergone  surgery or received therapy with steroids, antacids or antibiotics. klebsiella bacteraemia was more often found in males, in patients with hospital contact within the previous month, and polymicrobial infection. logistic regression analysis showed that use of invasive plastic devices and diabetes were significantly associated with klebsiella bacteraemia. the urinary tract was the commonest source, followed by the biliary tract; 27% of patients had no obvious focus of infection, and in many of these an invasive device may have been involved. forty-five k-serotypes were found--the largest number being nine strains of type k3; only a few strains had acquired resistance characters to antimicrobial agents. there were no differences between community- and hospital-acquired strains; indicating that our hospital does not have a resident  strain of klebsiella.

TI  == nasfed proteins mediate assimilatory nitrate and nitrite transport in klebsiella  oxytoca (pneumoniae) m5al.
AB  == klebsiella oxytoca can use nitrate and nitrite as sole nitrogen sources. the enzymes required for nitrate and nitrite assimilation are encoded by the nasfedcba operon. we report here the complete nasfed sequence. sequence comparisons indicate that the nasfed genes encode components of a conventional periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport system consisting of a periplasmic binding protein (nasf), a homodimeric intrinsic membrane protein (nase), and a homodimeric atp-binding cassette (abc) protein (nasd). the nasf protein and the related nrta and cmpa proteins of cyanobacteria contain leader (signal) sequences with the double-arginine motif that is hypothesized to direct  prefolded proteins to an alternate protein export pathway. the nase protein and the related nrtb and cmpb proteins of cyanobacteria contain unusual variants of the eaa loop sequence that defines membrane-intrinsic proteins of abc transporters. to characterize nitrate and nitrite transport, we constructed in-frame nonpolar deletions of the chromosomal nasfed genes. growth tests coupled with nitrate and nitrite uptake assays revealed that the nasfed genes are essential for nitrate transport and participate in nitrite transport as well. interestingly, the delta nasf strain exhibited leaky phenotypes, particularly at  elevated nitrate concentrations, suggesting that the nased proteins are not fully dependent on the nasf protein.

TI  == in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of  side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.

TI  == characterization, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding a reactivating factor for glycerol-inactivated adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase.
AB  == diol dehydratase undergoes suicide inactivation by glycerol during catalysis involving irreversible cleavage of the co-c bond of adenosylcobalamin. in permeabilized klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae cells, the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme or the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex is rapidly activated by the exchange of the inactivated coenzyme or cyanocobalamin for free  adenosylcobalamin in the presence of atp and mg2+ (honda, s., toraya, t., and fukui, s. (1980) j. bacteriol. 143, 1458-1465; ushio, k., honda, s., toraya, t.,  and fukui, s. (1982) j. nutr. sci. vitaminol. 28, 225-236). permeabilized escherichia coli cells co-expressing the diol dehydratase genes with two open reading frames in the 3'-flanking region were capable of reactivating glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase as well as activating the enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in situ in the presence of free adenosylcobalamin,  atp, and mg2+. these open reading frames, designated as ddra and ddrb genes, were identified as the genes of a putative reactivating factor for inactivated diol dehydratase. the genes encoded polypeptides consisting of 610 and 125 amino acid  residues with predicted molecular weights of 64,266 and 13,620, respectively. co-expression of the open reading frame in the 5'-flanking region was stimulatory but not obligatory for conferring the reactivating activity upon e. coli. thus, the product of this gene was considered not an essential component of the reactivating factor.

TI  == an allelic variant of the chromosomal gene for class a beta-lactamase k2, specific for klebsiella pneumoniae, is the ancestor of shv-1.
AB  == fecal klebsiella isolates from neonates in 22 swedish special care units were examined by a pcr we developed for detection of the shv-1 beta-lactamase gene. all 105 k. pneumoniae isolates and all 11 k. pneumoniae reference strains (including the k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, ozaenae, and rhinoscleromatis type strains) tested were positive, whereas all 67 k. oxytoca isolates and the k. oxytoca, k. planticola, and k. terrigena type strains tested were negative. resistance to beta-lactams in k. pneumoniae was not transferable by conjugation,  and the beta-lactamase gene was never found on a plasmid. southern blot analysis  showed that the gene had a defined chromosomal location. isoelectric focusing and sequencing of 231-bp pcr amplicons from different isolates revealed many variants of the enzyme, with the two main groups being shv-1 like (pi 7.6; 68 isolates) and len-1 like (pi 7.1; 14 isolates). clavulanic acid markedly reduced the mics of ampicillin for all the k. pneumoniae isolates tested. this fact, mic profiles  (penicillin rather than cephalosporin resistance), pis, and sequence data showed  that the chromosomal beta-lactamase of k. pneumoniae is a class a, group 2 enzyme distinct from the chromosomal ampc enzymes found in several other gram-negative bacteria and from the chromosomal beta-lactamase k1 of k. oxytoca. we propose that the chromosomal beta-lactamase of k. pneumoniae be designated k2 and suggest that an allelic pi 7.6 variant of this enzyme is the ancestor of the shv family of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.

TI  == klebsiella meningitis in taiwan: an overview.
AB  == klebsiella infection has been considered to be an uncommon cause of meningitis. to determine its incidence and clinical features, we reviewed the microbiologic records of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and blood cultures and the medical records of patients with bacterial meningitis admitted between 1981 and 1995. klebsiella  meningitis was diagnosed in 79 patients with 83 episodes. all patients had klebsiella isolated from csf and/or blood and typical symptoms and signs of acute bacterial meningitis. of these, 74 were over 16 years of age and 2 of the 5 children were infants. there was an increased prevalence rate of klebsiella meningitis after 1986. of the 83 episodes, only 9 occurred between 1981 and 1986, accounting for 7.8% of 115 cases with csf and/or blood culture-proven acute bacterial meningitis, whereas in 1987-95, there were 74 episodes accounting for 17.7% of 419 bacteriologically proven cases. k. pneumoniae accounted for 69 episodes, k. oxytoca, 11 episodes and k. ozaenae, 3 episodes. male gender, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis were commonly associated with k. pneumoniae meningitis. neurosurgical procedures were frequently associated with k. oxytoca meningitis. all three patients with k. ozaenae meningitis had a primary disease of the nasopharyngeal pathway. the mortality rate due to k. pneumoniae was 48.5%, k. oxytoca, 10% and k. ozaenae, 0%. in patients with k. pneumoniae meningitis, poor prognostic factors included age over 60 years, diabetes mellitus, bacteremia and severe neurological deficits on the first day of treatment.

TI  == propanediol utilization genes (pdu) of salmonella typhimurium: three genes for the propanediol dehydratase.
AB  == the propanediol utilization (pdu) operon of salmonella typhimurium encodes proteins required for the catabolism of propanediol, including a coenzyme b12-dependent propanediol dehydratase. a clone that expresses propanediol dehydratase activity was isolated from a salmonella genomic library. dna sequence analysis showed that the clone included part of the pduf gene, the pduabcde genes, and a long partial open reading frame (orf1). the clone included 3.9 kbp of pdu dna which had not been previously sequenced. complementation and expression studies with subclones constructed via pcr showed that three genes (pducde) are necessary and sufficient for propanediol dehydratase activity. the function of orf1 was not determined. analyses showed that the s. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was related to coenzyme b12-dependent glycerol dehydratases from citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. unexpectedly, the s. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was found to be 98% identical in amino acid sequence to the klebsiella oxytoca propanediol dehydratase; this is a much higher identity than expected, given the relationship between these organisms. dna sequence analyses also supported previous studies indicating that the pdu operon was inherited along with the adjacent cobalamin biosynthesis operon by a single horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == comparison of screening methods for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and their prevalence among blood isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. in a belgian teaching hospital.
AB  == using a set of 33 well-defined extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing  strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, we compared three screening methods for esbl detection: (i) a double-disk synergy test, (ii) a three-dimensional test (both the double-disk synergy test and the three-dimensional test were performed with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefepime), and (iii) the etest esbl screen (ab biodisk, solna, sweden), based on the recognition of a reduction in the ceftazidime mic in the presence of clavulanic acid. in the double-disk test, all four indicator antibiotics scored equally and 31 of the 33 reference strains were recognized. in the three-dimensional test, ceftriaxone was the only satisfactory indicator and 30 esbl-positive strains were detected by this antibiotic. both systems produced two false-positive results with cefepime. with the etest esbl screen, 15 of 16 tem-related and 11 of 16 shv-related esbl-producing strains scored positive. in 10 cases the clavulanic acid on one end of the strip interfered with the mic determination for ceftazidime, which was read on the opposite end. this mic had to be determined with an extra ceftazidime-only strip. no false-positive results  were noted. eighty-six blood isolates of e. coli and klebsiella species were screened for esbl expression by the double-disk and three-dimensional tests, both with ceftriaxone. six strains with suspicious antibiogram phenotypes also gave positive results by the double-disk test. one e. coli strain remained undetected  by the three-dimensional test. identification of the enzymes suspected of being esbls by isoelectric focusing (all strains) and dna sequencing (1 strain) confirmed the screening test results except for one klebsiella oxytoca strain, which proved to be a hyperproducer of its chromosomal enzyme and which also had a negative etest score. the five true esbl producers were all confirmed by the etest esbl screen. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis proved that the e. coli strains were unrelated, but that two of the three k. pneumoniae strains were closely related.

TI  == rarity of transferable beta-lactamase production by klebsiella species.
AB  == we report a survey of beta-lactamases and their transferability in klebsiella spp. isolated from blood during 1992-95. beta-lactamases were characterized by determination of isoelectric point (pi), by hybridization of plasmid dna preparations with probes for shv and tem sequences and by pcr with shv- or tem-specific primers. there were 80 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and 22 isolates of klebsiella oxytoca. most isolates of k. pneumoniae had a chromosomally encoded shv-1 beta-lactamase (or a closely related enzyme); k. oxytoca also produced chromosomal beta-lactamases, but these were distinct from shv-1. plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases were rare in klebsiella spp., being found  in six (7.5%) isolates of k. pneumoniae and in none of the k. oxytoca. beta-lactamase activities were relatively low (< 100 nmoles nitrocefin hydrolysed per minute per mg of protein) and ampicillin mics were < or = 128 mg/l for most isolates of both species. however, all isolates of k. pneumoniae with plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases, three other isolates of k. pneumoniae and three  isolates of k. oxytoca had high beta-lactamase activities (> 100 nmoles/mg/min) and very high ampicillin mics (> or = 1024 mg/l).

TI  == characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases of certain aerobic bacteria representing human colonic flora.
AB  == we have recently proposed the existence of a bacteriocolonic pathway for ethanol  oxidation [i.e., ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases (adhs) of intestinal bacteria resulting in high intracolonic levels of reactive and toxic acetaldehyde]. the aim of this in vitro study was to characterize further adh activity of some aerobic bacteria, representing the normal human colonic flora. these bacteria were earlier shown to possess high cytosolic adh activities (escherichia coli ih 133369, klebsiella pneumoniae ih 35385, klebsiella oxytoca ih 35339, pseudomonas aeruginosa ih 35342, and hafnia alvei ih 53227). adhs of the tested bacteria strongly preferred nad as a cofactor. marked adh activities were found in all bacteria, even at low ethanol concentrations (1.5 mm) that may  occur in the colon due to bacterial fermentation. the km for ethanol varied from  29.9 mm for k. pneumoniae to 0.06 mm for hafnia alvei. the inhibition of adh by 4-methylpyrazole was found to be of the competitive type in 4 of 5 bacteria, and  ki varied from 18.26 +/- 3.3 mm for escherichia coli to 0.47 +/- 0.13 mm for k. pneumoniae. at ph 7.4, adh activity was significantly lower than at ph 9.6 in four bacterial strains. adh of k. oxytoca, however, showed almost equal activities at neutral ph and at 9.6. in conclusion, nad-linked alcohol dehydrogenases of aerobic colonic bacteria possess low apparent km's for ethanol. accordingly, they may oxidize moderate amounts of ethanol ingested during social  drinking with nearly maximal velocity. this may result in the marked production of intracolonic acetaldehyde. kinetic characteristics of the bacterial enzymes may enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even from endogenous ethanol formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation. the microbial adhs were inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole by the same competitive inhibition as hepatic adh,  however, with nearly 1000 times lower susceptibility. individual variations in human colonic flora may thus contribute to the risk of alcohol-related gastrointestinal morbidity, such as diarrhea, colon polyps and cancer, and liver  injury.

TI  == klebsiella bacteraemia: community versus nosocomial infection.
AB  == in the period 1988-1993, 241 patients had klebsiella bacteraemia at our medical centre. the annual number of patients with positive blood cultures increased from 306 in 1988 to 622 in 1993, representing a 4.5-6% positivity rate of drawn cultures. after e. coli, klebsiella was the leading cause of gram-negative bacteraemia. during this period, the absolute number of klebsiella bacteraemia increased from 25 in 1988 to 84 in 1993; this represents a true increase in klebsiellaa bacteraemia, from 6-7% of positive cultures in the late 1980s to 12-13% in more recent years. there were 210 cases with k. pneumoniae and 31 with  k. oxytoca. a representative sample of 80 records was retrieved and subdivided into two groups: community-acquired klebsiella bacteraemia (cakb) vs. hospital-acquired klebsiella bacteraemia (hakb). urinary tract infection was the  underlying source of 58% of cakb vs 28% of hakb (p < 0.01); pneumonia occurred significantly more often in hakb (25%) than in cakb (7%) (p < 0.01). in hakb, as  compared to cakb, serious manifestations of illness were more common, e.g. shock  (65% vs. 37%, p < 0.046) and respiratory failure (45% vs. 20%, p < 0.046). overall mortality was 32%, 22% of patients with cakb died vs. 42% of those with hakb (p < 0.05). multiple drug resistance was very common: only 57% of all klebsiella strains were susceptible to gentamicin, 66% to ceftriaxone, 70% to ciprofloxacin, and 83% to amikacin. the susceptibility rates of klebsiella spp isolated from patients with hakb were significantly lower (p < 0.001). sepsis due to multiple-drug-resistant klebsiellaa has become frequent, carrying significant  morbidity and mortality. restriction of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in the hospital and the community as well as implementation of infection control measures are needed to contain this problem.

TI  == the secretin-specific, chaperone-like protein of the general secretory pathway: separation of proteolytic protection and piloting functions.
AB  == the chaperone-like protein of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway from klebsiella oxytoca, the outer membrane lipoprotein puls, protects the multimeric secretin puld from degradation and promotes its correct localization to the outer membrane. to determine whether these are separable functions, or whether resistance to proteolysis results simply from correct localization of puld, we replaced the lipoprotein-type signal peptide of puls by  the signal peptide of periplasmic maltose-binding protein. the resulting periplasmic puls retained its ability to protect puld, but not its ability to localize puld to the outer membrane and to function in pullulanase secretion. periplasmic puls competed with wild-type puls to prevent pullulanase secretion, presumably again by causing mislocalization of puld. a hybrid protein comprising  the mature part of puls fused to the c-terminus of full-length maltose-binding protein (male-puls) had similar properties to the periplasmic puls protein. moreover, male-puls was shown to associate with puld by amylose-affinity chromatography. the male-puls hybrid was rendered completely functional (i.e. it  restored pullulanase secretion in a puls mutant) by replacing its signal peptide  with a lipoprotein-type signal peptide. however, this fattyacylated hybrid protein was only functional if it also carried a lipoprotein sorting signal that  targeted it to the outer membrane. thus, the two functions of puls are separate and fully dissociable. incorrect localization, rather than proteolysis, of puld in the absence of puls was shown to be the factor that causes high-level induction of the phage shock response. the erwinia chrysanthemi puls homologue, outs, can substitute for puls, and puls can protect the secretin outd from proteolysis in escherichia coli, indicating the possible existence of a family of puls-like chaperone proteins.

AB  == the gld genes encoding adenosylcobalamin-dependent glycerol dehydrase of klebsiella pneumoniae were cloned by cross-hybridization with a dna fragment of klebsiella oxytoca diol dehydrase genes. since the escherichia coli clones isolated did not show appreciable enzyme activity, plasmids for high level expression of cloned genes were constructed. the enzyme expressed in e. coli was  indistinguishable from the wild-type glycerol dehydrase of k. pneumoniae by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic, immunochemical, and catalytic properties. it was also shown that the recombinant functional enzyme consists of  mr 61,000, 22,000, and 16, 000 subunits. sequence analysis of the genes revealed  four open reading frames separated by 2-12 bases. the sequential three open reading frames from the first to the third (glda, gldb, and gldc genes) encoded polypeptides of 555, 194, and 141 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 60,659(alpha), 21,355(beta), and 16,104(gamma), respectively. high level expression of these three genes in e. coli produced more than 14-fold higher level of fully active apoenzyme than that in k. pneumoniae. it was thus concluded that these are the genes encoding the subunits of glycerol dehydrase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the three subunits were 71, 58, and 54% identical with those of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of diol dehydrase, respectively, but failed to show any apparent homology with other proteins.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases amongst klebsiella spp. from intensive care units in europe.
AB  == consecutive klebsiellae were collected from icu patients at 35 centres in western and southern europe. of 966 isolates obtained, 716 were klebsiella pneumoniae, 248 were klebsiella oxytoca and two were klebsiella ozaenae. most were from belgium, france, germany, holland, italy, portugal, spain, turkey and a few from  greece and the uk. production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) was inferred in 220 isolates on the basis of synergy between ceftazidime and clavulanate. putative esbl producers were received from 23 centres, including 20  of the 27 that contributed more than 10 klebsiellae. over 88% of putative esbl producers were resistant to ceftazidime 2 mg/l, ceftriaxone 1 mg/l and aztreonam  1 mg/l, whereas, amongst esbl-negative isolates, more than 98% of k. pneumoniae and 87% of k. oxytoca were susceptible to these concentrations. putative esbl producers wre also more resistant to cefuroxime and cefoxitin than non-producers, but not to biapenem. mic distributions of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam  and aminoglycosides were bimodal for esbl producers, with some isolates highly sensitive and others very resistant. for example, 70% of putative esbl producers  were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam 16 + 4 mg/l, but 30% were resistant,  some highly so. resistance to this combination, and to ciprofloxacin, was clustered in certain centres. two other groups of cephalosporin-resistant isolates were identified besides esbl producers, viz. (i) nine isolates, from three centres, with ampc beta-lactamases and (ii) 20 k. oxytoca, from 15 centres, that hyperproduced k1 enzyme. examination of the hospitals' own susceptibility data indicated that up to 33% of putative esbl producers had been reported susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins or monobactams. this is disturbing, since esbls have been associated with clinical failure even when only low-level resistance was apparent in vitro.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

TI  == multimers of the precursor of a type iv pilin-like component of the general secretory pathway are unrelated to pili.
AB  == both the mature and precursor forms of pulg, a type iv pilin-like component of the general secretory pathway of klebsiella oxytoca, can be chemically cross-linked into multimers similar to those obtained by cross-linking the components of type iv pili. to explore the possibility that the pulg precursor could form a pilus-like structure, the pulg sequence was altered in a variety of  ways, including (i) replacement of the characteristic hydrophobic region, which is required for the assembly of type iv pilins by the male signal peptide, or (ii) fusion of beta-lactamase (beta lam) to the c-terminus. neither of these changes affected multimerization. pulg precursor could be post-translationally processed by prepilin peptidase (pulo), indicating that the n-terminus of prepulg remains on the cytoplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane where it is accessible to the catalytic site of this enzyme. finally, precursor and mature forms of pulg could be efficiently cross-linked in a mixed dimer, indicating that at least a subpopulation of the two forms of the protein are probably located in  clusters in the cytoplasmic membrane. these results provide further evidence that the cross-linked multimers of the precursor form of pulg are unrelated to type iv pilus-like structures. it is still unclear whether a subpopulation of processed pulg can be assembled into a rudimentary pilus-like structure.

TI  == gram-negative bacteremia in open-heart-surgery patients traced to probable tap-water contamination of pressure-monitoring equipment.
AB  == objective: to determine the cause(s) of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia (gnb) in open-heart-surgery (ohs) patients at hospital a. design: case-control and cohort studies and an environmental survey. results: nine patients developed  gnb with enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), serratia marcescens (2), or klebsiella oxytoca (1) following ohs; five of nine patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. when the gnb patients were compared with randomly selected ohs patients, having had the first procedure of the day (8 of 9 versus 12 of 27, p = .02), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 122 versus 83 minutes, p = .01) or cross-clamp times (median, 75 versus 42 minutes, p = .008), intraoperative dopamine infusion (9 of 9 versus 15 of 27, p = .01), or exposure to scrub nurse 6 (6 of 9 versus 4 of 27, p = .001) were identified as risk factors. when stratified by length of the procedure, only being the first procedure of the day and exposure to scrub nurse 6 remained significant. first procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment that was assembled before surgery and left open and uncovered overnight in the operating room, whereas other procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment assembled immediately before the procedure. at night, operating rooms were cleaned by maintenance personnel who used a disinfectant-water solution sprayed through a hose connected to an automatic diluting system. observation of the use of this hose documented that this solution could have contacted and entered uncovered pressure-monitoring equipment left in the operating room. water samples from the  hose revealed no disinfectant, but grew p aeruginosa. the outbreak was terminated by setting up pressure-monitoring equipment immediately before the procedure and  discontinuing use of the hose-disinfectant system. conclusions: this outbreak most likely resulted from contamination of uncovered preassembled pressure-monitoring equipment by water from a malfunctioning spray disinfectant device. pressure-monitoring equipment should be assembled immediately before use  and protected from possible environmental contamination.

TI  == sulbactam and clavulanic acid: enzyme kinetics and synergy with ampicillin and mezlocillin.
AB  == the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, sulbactam and clavulanic acid, exhibit high affinity (k(i) < 10(-6)mol/l) for the beta-lactamases of gram-negative organisms  with predominantly penicillinase activity and much less affinity (especially clavulanic acid) for organisms with predominantly cephalosporinase activity. in tests to compare the synergy of these beta-lactamase inhibitors with other antibiotics, clavulanic acid and ampicillin or mezlocillin demonstrated greater synergy than sulbactam and ampicillin or mezlocillin, with isolates forming either a plasmid-coded beta-lactamase or a chromosomal enzyme with predominantly  penicillinase activity. however, neither sulbactam nor clavulanic acid were able  to protect ampicillin or mezlocillin adequately against inactivation by beta-lactamase overproducing variants of klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca, irrespective of the extent of synergy seen with the corresponding wild strains. it was interesting to note the synergy between mezlocillin and sulbactam with respect to beta-lactamase overproducing variants of clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae. a statistically significant correlation between the quantities of beta-lactamase formed and synergy between the beta-lactamase inhibitor and the antibiotic with which it was combined was not retained in studies of clinical isolates in any case. these observations correlate well with  the results obtained in routine testing of the combinations of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of klebsiella pneumoniae producing shv-5 beta- lactamase:  parallel outbreaks due to multiple plasmid transfer.
AB  == over a period of 22 months, 32 patients treated in three independent intensive care units of the innsbruck university hospital were infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing members of the family enterobacteriaceae (30 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, and 1 escherichia coli isolate). as confirmed by sequencing of a bla gene pcr fragment, all isolates expressed the shv-5-type beta-lactamase. genomic  fingerprinting of epidemic strains with xbai and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped 20 of 21 isolates from ward a into two consecutive clusters which included 1 of 3 ward b isolates. all six k. pneumoniae isolates from ward c formed a third cluster. stool isolates of asymptomatic patients and environmental isolates belonged to these clusters as well. additionally, 2,600 routine k. pneumoniae isolates from the surrounding provinces (population, 900,000) were screened for shv-5 production. only one of six nonepidemic isolates producing shv-5 beta-lactamase was matched with the outbreak strains by genomic fingerprinting. plasmid fingerprinting, however, revealed the epidemic spread of  a predominant r-plasmid, with a size of approximately 80 kb, associated with 29 of the 30 k. pneumoniae isolates. this plasmid was also present in the single k.  oxytoca and e. coli isolates from ward c and in three nonepidemic isolates producing shv-5. our results underline that strain typing exclusively on the genomic level can be misleading in the epidemiological investigation of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. our evidence for multiple events of r-plasmid transfer between species of the family enterobacteriaceae in  this nosocomial outbreak stresses the need for plasmid typing, especially because shv-5 beta-lactamase seems to be regionally spread predominantly via plasmid transfer.

TI  == insertion of an outer membrane protein in escherichia coli requires a chaperone-like protein.
AB  == only one of the characterized components of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (gsp) in gram-negative bacteria, gspd, is an integral outer membrane protein that could conceivably form a channel to permit protein transport across this membrane. puld, a member of the gspd protein family required for pullulanase secretion by klebsiella oxytoca, is shown here to form outer membrane-associated complexes which are not readily dissociated by sds treatment. the outer membrane association of puld is absolutely dependent on another component of the gsp, the outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein puls. furthermore, the absence of puls resulted in limited proteolysis of puld and caused induction of the so-called phage shock response, as measured by increased  expression of the pspa gene. we propose that puls may be the first member of a new family of periplasmic chaperones that are specifically required for the insertion of a group of outer membrane proteins into this membrane. puls is only  the second component of the main terminal branch of the gsp for which a precise function can be proposed.

AB  == to evaluate whether clinical klebsiella isolates differ from nonclinical strains  with respect to bacteriocin susceptibility patterns, a total of 452 klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains isolated from different sources were examined.  bacteriocin typing was done by a modification of the scrape-and-point method, using a set of eight producer strains. 96% of the strains were typable. forty-one different bacteriocin susceptibility patterns were observed. while two thirds of  the k. oxytoca isolates belonged to only three different bacteriocin types, the k. pneumoniae strains showed a more heterogeneous distribution of patterns. no differences in pattern distribution were observed between isolates from clinical, fecal, or environmental sources. certain bacteriocins showed a very broad spectrum of activity; e.g. 93% of all isolates were susceptible to bacteriocin type 3. the results suggest that nonclinical klebsiella strains do not show other bacteriocin susceptibility types than clinical isolates do.

AB  == of 13 consecutive episodes of gram-negative septicemia (escherichia coli eight, klebsiella oxytoca four, klebsiella pneumoniae one) among 113 infants in three special-care neonatal units studied, five episodes were epidemiologically related according to a novel fingerprinting method for enterobacteria. in ten episodes the invasive phenotype was found in the fecal flora of up to 54% of the fellow infants in the same ward and for periods of up to 70 days. two units exchanged patients, which further promoted the transmission of invasive strains. the attack index was highest for certain e. coli strains, generally low for k. oxytoca strains, but lowest for other e. coli strains. the infants contracting septicemia had lower birth weight (p = 0.04) or were more often classified as high-risk infants than matched non-infected fecal carriers of the invasive strains (p = 0.04). in summary, gram-negative neonatal septicemia was either due to an apparently high-virulent strain capable of attacking the single full-term infant  carrier or a high-colonizing phenotype of lower apparent virulence, which occasionally attacked a high-risk infant among a large number of infants colonized.

AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == surveillance of oral cultures for enterobacteriaceae during bone marrow transplantation.
AB  == bone marrow-transplanted patients can suffer from severe life-threatening infections. oral bacterial cultures were collected from a group of 40 patients prior to and following bone marrow transplantation every 3 days, following initial preparation and eradication of oral infections. the samples were grown on the titertek-enterobac kit specific for enterobacteriaceae. in 426 oral cultures  30.5% grew gram-negative bacteria, 76.6% of them were enterobacteriaceae. young male patients had 8.3% positive cultures at the study start, a percentage which constantly increased during later periods. older patients did not follow the same pattern. also, the allogeneic transplantation group had a higher percentage of enterobacteriaceae than the autologous group (49.0 versus 19.5%). in blood cultures 18 out of the 94 positive ones showed the presence of enterobacteriaceae. the most commonly found microorganisms in oral cultures were  klebsiella oxytoca (23%), enterobacter cloacae (18%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (15%). the decrease in the positive oral cultures from 35.0% during the pretransplantation period to 5.4% close to the transplantation, demonstrates that the preparatory protocol used for the prevention of oral infections was highly effective.

TI  == the type 3 fimbrial adhesin gene (mrkd) of klebsiella species is not conserved among all fimbriate strains.
AB  == the type 3 fimbriae of enteric bacteria mediate agglutination, in vitro, of erythrocytes treated with tannic acid. the gene encoding the polypeptide, mrkd, that mediates this agglutination reaction was placed downstream of an inducible promoter, and the ability of mrkd alone to facilitate hemagglutination was determined. although escherichia coli transformants could be shown to produce the mrkd protein, hemagglutination did not occur in the absence of other mrk gene products. in addition, the mrkd polypeptide did not cross the bacterial outer membrane unless a fimbrial chaperone protein was also present. analysis of the frequency of the mrkd gene within the genus klebsiella indicated that this gene is conserved in strains of klebsiella oxytoca but not in other fimbriate klebsiella species. in the small number of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae that  do possess a related mrkd gene, this determinant could be found on a plasmid in one strain. the ability of type 3 fimbriate bacteria to adhere to type v collagen was found to be a function of a specific mrkd polypeptide. this adhesin is frequently found in strains of k. oxytoca but is rarely associated with the type  3 fimbriae of k. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  == chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional  rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. the intestinal  content isolated from conventional rats reduced r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced r(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. on the other hand, enterobacter aerogenes and micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced s(-)-flosequinan. the sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body  to produce r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan.

TI  == the nasfedcba operon for nitrate and nitrite assimilation in klebsiella pneumoniae m5al.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae can use nitrate and nitrite as sole nitrogen sources through the nitrate assimilation pathway. we previously identified structural genes for assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases, nasa and nasb, respectively. we report here our further identification of four genes, nasfedc, upstream of the nasba genes. the nasfedcba genes probably form an operon. mutational and complementation analyses indicated that both the nasc and nasa genes are required for nitrate assimilation. the predicted nasc protein is homologous to a variety of nadh-dependent oxidoreductases. thus, the nasc protein probably mediates electron transfer from nadh to the nasa protein, which contains the active site for nitrate reduction. the deduced nasf, nase, and nasd proteins  are homologous to the nrta, nrtb, and nrtd proteins, respectively, that are involved in nitrate uptake in synechococcus sp. (t. omata, x. andriesse, and a. hirano, mol. gen. genet. 236:193-202, 1993). mutational and complementation studies indicated that the nasd gene is required for nitrate but not nitrite assimilation. by analogy with the synechococcus nrt genes, we propose that the nasfed genes are involved in nitrate transport in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == convergent evolution of tem-26, a beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum activity.
AB  == tem-26, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase has been characterized in clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli derived from patients on the paediatric oncology unit of st james's university hospital, leeds. the nucleotide sequence of this beta-lactamase gene (blatem26b) was determined, and compared with the nucleotide sequences of other tem-type beta-lactamases. the blatem26b gene was found to differ from blatem12b by a single nucleotide. this difference causes the substitution of glutamic acid in blatem12b for lysine in blatem26b at position 102 in the predicted amino acid sequence. the blatem12b gene was first described in an isolate of klebsiella oxytoca from a patient nursed on the same unit that yielded the strains that carry blatem26b. however, the blatem26b gene differs at no less than six nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence encoding the tem-26 beta-lactamase that was first described in isolates  from cancer patients nursed in the children's hospital, stanford, california, usa. this indicates that the genes encoding tem-26 have evolved from different progenitors.

TI  == production of polyhydroxyalkanoates in sucrose-utilizing recombinant escherichia  coli and klebsiella strains.
AB  == the cloned poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (phb) synthesis pathway from alcaligenes eutrophus has been introduced into sucrose-utilizing strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca. the plasmid-borne genes were well expressed in these environments and were able to mediate the production of significant amounts of phb when the bacteria were grown with sucrose as the sole  carbon source. the molecular weight of the phb polymer made in k. aerogenes and e. coli was approximately 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6). sucrose uptake in k. aerogenes  was measured and found to be similar to that found for other klebsiella strains,  but sucrose uptake in the e. coli strain was not detectable. k. aerogenes is able to utilize sugarcane molasses as the sole carbon source to accumulate phb at the  rate of approximately 1 g of phb per liter of culture fluid per h. a k. oxytoca fadr strain was able to incorporate 3-hydroxyvalerate into a poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (phb-co-v) polymer to levels as high as 56 mol% when grown in a medium containing propionate. total phb-co-v levels could be enhanced by adding propionate at the beginning of stationary phase rather than at the time of inoculation.

AB  == a hybridoma secreting a monoclonal antibody (mab) directed against klebsiella lipopolysaccharide (lps) was derived from spleen cells of mice immunized a smooth, nonencapsulated klebsiella strain (friedlander 201; serogroup o1). the mab, called v/9-5 (immunoglobulin g2a), cross-reacted with lps preparations produced from reference strains for the klebsiella o serogroups o1, o2ab, o2ac, o3, o4, o5, and o12. furthermore, the mab reacted with lpss from serogroup reference strains o6/o8, o9, and o11, which are regarded as being identical to o1, o2, and o4, respectively. when testing the supernatant of clinically isolated klebsiella strains by means of an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that 86 (92.4%) of 93 klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae isolates and 24 (96.0%) of 25 k. oxytoca isolates harbored the cross-reactive epitope. by  contrast, two laboratory strains of k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis did not react with mab v/9-5. the mab proved to be specific for the genus klebsiella, since it did not react with any of a total of 73 strains belonging to other gram-negative bacterial genera. in conjunction with other lps-specific mabs, mab  v/9-5 might become a useful reagent for rapid identification of klebsiellae in clinical specimens. furthermore, the epitope recognized by mab v/9-5 might serve  as a target epitope for the production of human mabs for immunotherapeutic purposes.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation shown by seven enterobacterial species.
AB  == the anaerobic glycerol pathway was studied in seven enterobacterial species selected as representative of different behaviours in terms of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation. the presence of oxidative and reductive pathways of the dha regulon in klebsiella pneumoniae enabled the cells to grow fermentatively on glycerol. the first two enzymes of the dha regulon (glycerol dehydrogenase type i and dihydroxyacetone kinase) represent the oxidative branch, while the latter two (glycerol dehydratase and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase) represent the reductive  branch of glycerol fermentation. the slower utilization of glycerol by k. oxytoca was attributed to low production of 1,3-propanediol. k. oxytoca lacked glycerol dehydratase and demonstrated low 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase activity. k. planticola and k. ozaenae differed from k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca in lacking the ability to grow on glycerol. k. planticola lacked both enzymes of the reductive branch of glycerol fermentation, and k. ozaenae possessed glycerol dehydrogenase only. k. rhinoscleromatis and hafnia alvei, like escherichia coli,  did not possess a dha regulon. the glycerol dehydrogenase type ii of h. alvei was distinct from that of e. coli. the phenotypic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation may have taxonomic applications.

AB  == a new method for multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, based on electrophoretic transfers to nitrocellulose after polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis was  explored. electrophoretic separation was performed on 1-mm-thick slab gels with 6-mul samples of bacterial extracts and was followed by serial 5-min consecutive  transfers. the transferability of 19 metabolic enzymes of klebsiella strains was  studied and allowed the simultaneous examination of one enzyme in the separation  gel and at least five enzymes on nitrocellulose sheets. the resolution of enzyme  bands was increased on nitrocellulose; thus, well-separated bands were recorded for nucleoside phosphorylase, peptidase, and phosphoglucose isomerase whereas their mobility variants could not be clearly distinguished in the separation gel  because of stain diffusion. the study of genetic relationships of 42 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 24 strains of klebsiella oxytoca demonstrated the reliability of the method, since clustering analysis of electrophoretic types, based on electrophoretic polymorphism of 10 metabolic enzymes, showed two main clusters well correlated with the two species. the 57 electrophoretic types described confirm the usefulness of the method for the study of genetic relationships between closely related strains.

TI  == appendix. cloning and sequence of the gene encoding enzyme e-1 from the methionine salvage pathway of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the methionine salvage pathway converts the methylthioribose moiety of 5'-(methylthio)-adenosine to methionine via a series of biochemical steps. one enzyme active in this pathway, a bifunctional enolase-phosphatase called e-1 that promotes oxidative cleavage of the synthetic substrate 2,3-diketo-1-phosphohexane to 2-keto-pentanoate, has been purified from klebsiella pneumoniae and is characterized in the preceding paper (myers, r., wray, j., fish, s., and abeles,  r. h. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 24785-24791). we synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to portions of the amino terminus of e-1. these oligonucleotides were used as polymerase chain reaction primers on whole genomic  dna from klebsiella oxytoca. this resulted in an 82-base pair dna fragment that was used as a hybridization probe to obtain a clone of the e-1 gene from a k. oxytoca gene library. the dna sequence of the e-1 coding region was determined, and the amino acid sequence of e-1 was deduced. e-1 appears to represent a novel  class of enzymes since no homology to known enzymes was found. cloning the gene from k. oxytoca on a multicopy plasmid leads to overproduction of e-1 enzyme that has properties indistinguishable from those of the enzyme from k. pneumoniae.

TI  == the general secretory pathway of klebsiella oxytoca: no evidence for relocalization or assembly of pilin-like pulg protein into a multiprotein complex.
AB  == it has been proposed that the four type iv pilin-like proteins that are required  for extracellular protein secretion by the general secretory pathway (gsp) might  assemble into a trans-periplasm complex resembling a type iv pilus. to test this  idea, we examined the subcellular distribution and oligomeric state of pulg, one  of the type iv pilin-like proteins required for pullulanase secretion in klebsiella oxytoca. fractionation of escherichia coli cells carrying a single copy of each pul gene showed that pulg protein was located in two distinct envelope fractions corresponding to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes. the protein was partially released by treating the membranes with triton x-100 + edta or at high ph, but not by triton x-100 alone or by 8 m urea, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or 1 m nacl. like type iv pilins, non-sedimentable pulg that had been released from the membranes at high ph could be sedimented by centrifugation when the ph was lowered. treatment of whole cells, sphaeroplasts or isolated membranes with a cleavable cross-linking agent produced mainly pulg homodimers. previous studies showed that both pulo, which cleaves and n-methylates the pulg precursor, and pule, a putative atp-binding protein, share extensive sequence identity with proteins known to be required for type iv pilus processing and assembly. however, mutations which disrupted either pule or pulo, or indeed the complete absence of all other components of the pullulanase secretion apparatus,  had little or no effect on any of the properties of pulg protein described above. we conclude that there is no evidence that pulg protein assembles into a stable multiprotein complex or that processing of the pulg precursor causes a detectable change in its subcellular distribution.

AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, several exoproteins synthesized with a signal sequence (elastase, lipase, phospholipases, alkaline phosphatase and exotoxin a) are secreted by a two-step mechanism. they first cross the inner membrane in a signal sequence-dependent way, and are further translocated across the outer membrane in a second step requiring secretion functions encoded by several xcp genes. ten xcp genes have already been characterized (bally et al., 1992a). in this study, two additional xcp genes, xcpp and xcpq, are described. they are located in the 40 min region of the chromosome where they probably define an operon, divergent from the xcpr-z operon previously characterized in this region. these two genes encode two proteins, xcpp and xcpq, similar to pulc and puld of the pul system of klebsiella oxytoca. moreover, the two divergent operons share a common regulation which is growth-phase dependent.

AB  == the in-vitro synergic activities of brl42715, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam combined with ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, or cefoperazone were tested against various bacteria producing known types of beta-lactamase. brl42715 showed the best synergistic activity among the inhibitors tested against strains producing penicillinases of  type i, ii, iii, v, and that from klebsiella pneumoniae, cephalosporinases, and oxyiminocephalosporinases (except that from klebsiella oxytoca). clavulanic acid  combined with the beta-lactams tested showed the best synergic activity of the inhibitors against strains producing type iv penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinase from k. oxytoca. the 50% inhibitory doses of brl42715 were superior to those of clavulanic acid against various types of beta-lactamases except for type iv penicillinase and the oxyiminocephalosporinase from k. oxytoca. the inhibitory activity of brl42715 against cephalosporinases from various bacteria was 10(4) to 10(6)-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. the synergic effects of brl42715 and clavulanic acid on the activity of piperacillin were compared against six clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to piperacillin. the synergic activity of brl42715 was greater than that of clavulanic acid in all six isolates.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and septi-chek release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == relationship between indole production and differentiation of klebsiella species: indole-positive and -negative isolates of klebsiella determined to be clonal.
AB  == klebsiellae are an important cause of nosocomial infections. the two clinically relevant species, klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca, are differentiated by the ability to produce indole from tryptophan, k. oxytoca being indole positive. we report here the detailed biochemical and molecular analysis of two isolates of klebsiella, cultured from the same urine specimen, that differed only in their ability to produce indole. the two isolates were identical as determined by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and they differed from 10 epidemiologically unrelated strains. probing with the escherichia coli tryptophanase operon, tna, revealed seven restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp) among the 12 strains. the two index strains had identical rflp; no single rflp could account for all of the indole-positive or -negative strains. thus, the identification of epidemiologically related strains  of klebsiella differing only in indole production may warrant further examination to determine whether the strains are clonal.

TI  == processing and methylation of puig, a pilin-like component of the general secretory pathway of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the signal sequence of the klebsiella oxytoca puig gene product, which is required for extracellular secretion of the enzyme pullulanase, is similar in many respects to the corresponding segment of the precursors of type iv (me-phe)  pilins. the significance of this similarity is confirmed by the observation that  the puio gene product processes prepuig at the consensus type iv prepilin peptidase cleavage site at the amino-terminal end of the puig signal sequence. like most type iv pilins, processed puig was found to have a methylated amino-terminal phenylalanine residue. site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace amino acids in prepuig that correspond to residues shown by others to be  essential for processing, methylation and assembly of type iv pilins. the glycine residue on the amino-terminal side of the prepuig cleavage site is absolutely required for processing and for pullulanase secretion. the glutamate residue at position 11(+5) is also required for pullulanase secretion but not for processing or methylation. this result contrasts with that reported for corresponding variants of pseudomonas aeruginosa type iv prepilin, which were processed but only inefficiently n-methylated. cleavage of prepuig and pullulanase secretion were both unaffected by replacement of the phenylalanine residue on the carboxy-terminal side of the cleavage site by leucine, isoleucine or valine, by a conservative substitution within the hydrophobic core of the prepuig signal sequence, or by a glutamine to proline substitution within the processed segment. however, replacement of the same glutamine residue by arginine abolished secretion without affecting either processing or methylation.

TI  == phylogenetic tree and sequence similarity of beta-lactamases.
AB  == beta-lactamases are the main cause of beta-lactam resistance in many pathogenic bacteria. these enzymes can be detected in a variety of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. the cyanobacteria are also known to produce a beta-lactamase. recently, the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of some of these beta-lactamases have been clarified. on the basis of  the amino acid sequences of 47 beta-lactamases and the computer-aided analysis, a phylogenetic tree is proposed in this paper. according to the tree, beta-lactamases are classified into six groups. group 1 beta-lactamases are mainly composed of plasmid-mediated enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. however, chromosome-derived beta-lactamases from klebsiella pneumoniae and rhodopseudomonas capsulata take part in this group. group 2 enzymes consist of a  part of the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from streptomyces, and chromosome-mediated enzymes from yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter diversus, and klebsiella oxytoca. chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria form group 3. group 4 is composed of metalloenzymes, whereas group 5 consists of oxa type beta-lactamases. chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-positive bacteria form group 6. comparison of the amino acid sequences among these groups confirmed the phylogenetic tree and the classification: the beta-lactamases in each group have its particular conserved amino acid sequences. in addition, the tree provides more detailed classification and time-scale mutual relationships and predicts new types of beta-lactamases that may be found. furthermore, the classification deduced from the tree is generally in accord with the one based on the amino acid sequences reported previously. however, the class a beta-lactamases are clearly divided into three groups: groups 1, 2, and 6. rdf2 analysis shows that some combinations between beta-lactamases and beta-lactam-interacting proteins as well as eukaryotic proteins have a low but significant evolutionary relatedness.

TI  == bacterial load of cockroaches in relation to urban environment.
AB  == sanitation is an important problem in relation to the control of pests in urban environments. this investigation analysed the potential risk related to the presence of cockroaches and their capacity for disseminating bacteria in six different types of buildings: hospital nursing area and out-patient area, swimming-pool pool-side and toilet area, low-income flats and food-handling places. fifty-six species of bacteria were identified from 157 samples, 14 of these have previously been reported as potentially pathogenic for man and vertebrates. similarities were found between samples collected in (a) the hospital out-patient area and food-handling establishments and (b) the hospital nursing area and flats. pool-sides possessed a poorer bacterial flora. there was  a greater bacterial specific diversity in food-handling establishments, flats and swimming-bath toilet area. enterobacter cloacae. klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca were dominant species in flats and the hospital nursing area.  therefore, cockroaches can play a role in disseminating bacteria, which they can  carry passively on their cuticle.

TI  == a survey of beta-lactamases from 618 isolates of klebsiella spp.
AB  == beta-lactamases from 618 isolates of klebsiella spp. (487 klebsiella pneumoniae and 131 klebsiella oxytoca) were identified by analytical isoelectric focusing. the strains were consecutive isolates from 618 different patients in five hospital centres between 1980 and 1984. most of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from the k. pneumoniae isolates had a pi of 7.1, and most of the k. oxytoca isolates had chromosomal beta-lactamases of pis 7.8, 5.3 and 5.5. plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases were produced by 91.8% of k. pneumoniae isolates and 9.9% of k. oxytoca isolates. the beta-lactamase types identified most frequently were shv-1 in the former species, and tem-1 in the latter species. of  the k. pneumoniae isolates, 101 produced both of these plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, while one strain produced an extended-spectrum shv-like beta-lactamase. of the 131 k. oxytoca isolates, 20 were hyper-producers of chromosomal beta-lactamase. the susceptibility of this genus to beta-lactam antibiotics is controlled almost exclusively by beta-lactamases, the production of which may differ from one strain to another; thus the empirical therapeutic use of beta-lactam antibiotics is not recommended for this genus.

TI  == plasmid dna analysis, biotyping, and antimicrobic susceptibility as subtyping tests for klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == we compared plasmid dna analysis, biotyping by vitek, and disk diffusion antimicrobic susceptibility as subtyping tests of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca. the 92 tested isolates were from alternate, culture-positive  patients over 6 months. no outbreak or cluster of infections was recognized during this interval. plasmid dna was detected in 85% of the isolates. each isolate except one had a reproducible absence of plasmid dna or a reproducible plasmid dna profile on repetitive testing. restriction endonuclease enzyme analysis of plasmid dna was necessary to distinguish differences among some isolates that had only large plasmids. isolates with only large plasmids represented 18% of the collection. of the 78 isolates with plasmid dna, all but two were considered different from one another by plasmid dna analysis. biotyping and antimicrobic susceptibility testing were not highly reproducible. in addition, biotyping did not demonstrate a sufficient variety of patterns among the isolates for subtyping purposes. we conclude that plasmid dna analysis is very useful as a subtyping test for isolates of k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca. neither biotyping nor antimicrobial susceptibility as performed in our laboratory had sufficient discriminatory power and reproducibility for subtyping these organisms.

TI  == [usefulness of plasmids as epidemiologic markers for typing of klebsiella].
AB  == the study was aimed at evaluation of utility of plasmids as epidemiological markers for interspecific differentiation of 200 strains of klebsiella isolated from patients with generalized infections and hospitalized at intensive care ward of the gdansk medical academy. strains isolated from the ward environment were also investigated. in the first phase of this study classical methods of typing were used, such as determination of the biochemical, bacteriocin (susceptibility  to 8 bacteriocins) and phage types, and mic for 9 antibiotics. basing on these methods it was found that 41 types of klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 types of klebsiella oxytoca and 1 type of klebsiella ozenae occur. six groups of bacteria  were differentiated in the group which had the same type. these strains were investigated for plasmid and restrictive patterns. identity of types occurring in individual groups was detected. for one of them, a restrictive pattern was determined by cleavage of plasmid dna by a restrictive eco rv enzyme. in remaining groups such pattern was not found, both after treatment with eco rv and hha i enzyme and this may be associated with modification of the plasmid dna. strains belonging to one of these groups did not contain plasmids in their cells.

TI  == [epidemiologic investigation of infection with klebsiella using phage typing as a method].
AB  == in epidemiological investigations of infections with klebsiella carried on by us  for many years, a lysotyping method was used with a success. the results which are now being presented deal with 638 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca originating from patients treated in hospitals in wroclaw, krakow, gdansk and sosnowiec during the years 1986-1992. susceptibility of strains to the standard set of 14 phages used since ten years decreased significantly, when compared with previously typed strains of klebsiella. out of  312 susceptible strains of klebsiella, majority (302) represented 47 phage types  described previously. sporadic appearance of new phage types was observed. some phagotypes (37, 47, 112, 117, 119, 142, 153 and 157) were represented most frequently and concerned 55% of susceptible strains. high repeatability of phage  types in consecutive groups of typed strains suggests a need for continuation of  this method for typing klebsiella. decreased susceptibility of strains to standard set of phages requires introduction of new typing bacteriophages.

TI  == prospective observational study of klebsiella bacteremia in 230 patients: outcome for antibiotic combinations versus monotherapy.
AB  == combination antimicrobial agent therapy has been advocated for treatment of gram-negative bacteremia, including that caused by klebsiella spp. we performed a prospective, observational, 10-hospital collaborative study to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic combination therapy versus that of monotherapy for 230 consecutive patients with klebsiella bacteremia. the species involved were k. pneumoniae (82%), k. oxytoca (15%), and k. ozaenae (0.4%). of the bacteremias, 26% were polymicrobial in nature. a total of 53% of cases were nosocomial infections. the most common portals were the urinary tract (28%), biliary tract (12%), lung (10%), and abdomen (9%). some 49 and 51% of the patients had received monotherapy and antibiotic combination therapy (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside), respectively; 14-day mortalities in the two groups were 20 and 18%, respectively. however, for the subgroup of patients who experienced hypotension within 72 h prior to or on the day of the positive blood culture, those patients who received combination therapy experienced significantly lower mortality (24%) than did those who received monotherapy (50%). we conclude that monotherapy with an antibiotic that is active in vitro against klebsiella (beta-lactam or aminoglycoside) is sufficient therapy for less severely ill patients (immunocompetent, urinary tract portal, mentally alert, normal vital signs). on the other hand, for severely ill patients who experience hypotension, antibiotic  combination therapy with a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside agent is preferred.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == analysis of eight out genes in a cluster required for pectic enzyme secretion by  erwinia chrysanthemi: sequence comparison with secretion genes from other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (c-ns) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. it is likely that the strains of c-ns causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. we  have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. a swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. the numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. the species of c-ns found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. however, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. there was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. there appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. c-ns were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. other organisms isolated included propionibacterium sp,  alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, pityrosporum sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant c-ns during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

AB  == a high concentration of total and fecal coliforms (5 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(7) cfu/g, respectively) was observed in samples representative of two production lots of mozzarella cheese from a local dairy. contamination was manifested by the swelling of plastic pouches and the formation of gas holes in mozzarella cheese.  aerobic and anaerobic sporeformers, heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, propionibacteria, and yeasts were absent. of the 41 isolates identified, there were 37 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 escherichia coli. exposure at 63 degrees c for 15 min caused the death of all total and fecal coliforms.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == siderophore production of klebsiella species isolated from different sources.
AB  == a total of 481 klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains isolated from different sources was examined for siderophore production. screening for siderophore secretion by chrome azurol s agar revealed that 475 strains (98.8%) produced siderophores. the isolates were further investigated for synthesis of enterochelin and aerobactin by means of specific bioassays. almost all klebsiella strains (99.4%) excreted enterochelin. aerobactin production, however, was rarely observed among k. pneumoniae (6%) and k. oxytoca (4%) isolates. the incidence of  aerobaction-positive strains was similar in clinical, fecal, and environmental isolates. these results suggest that the aerobactin system does not represent a major mechanism of iron supply in klebsiella spp.

TI  == fimbriation, capsulation, and iron-scavenging systems of klebsiella strains associated with human urinary tract infection.
AB  == thirty-two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and seven strains of klebsiella oxytoca isolated from urinary tract infections in elderly adults were analyzed for capsular antigens, iron-scavenging systems, and fimbriation. all strains were capsulated. twenty-seven different k antigens were identified among the strains,  with no particular antigen dominating. all strains produced the iron-scavenging system enterochelin as analyzed by bioassay and dna hybridization. in contrast, the aerobactin iron-sequestering system was not detected in any of the strains. all strains caused hemagglutination of tannin-treated human erythrocytes and reacted with an anti-type 3 fimbriae antiserum as well as in dna hybridization with a type 3 fimbria-specific probe, indicating that the klebsiella strains possessed this fimbrial type. possession of type 1 fimbriae was analyzed by agglutination tests and by hybridization with dna probes from two distinct klebsiella type 1 fimbria gene clusters. phenotypic expression of the type 1 fimbriae was found in 29 of 32 k. pneumoniae strains, whereas 30 strains reacted  with either of the two type 1 fimbrial cluster dna probes. in k. oxytoca, however, only three of seven strains expressed type 1 fimbriae and reacted with the dna probes. the type 3 fimbriae were found to bind to a fraction of epithelial cells exfoliated in normal human urine, whereas the type 1 fimbriae bound strongly to urinary slime. no inhibitors of type 3 fimbrial binding were detected in human urine.

TI  == pullulanase secretion in escherichia coli k-12 requires a cytoplasmic protein and a putative polytopic cytoplasmic membrane protein.
AB  == the previously uncharacterized third and fourth genes (pule and pulf) of the pullulanase secretion gene operon of klebsiella oxytoca strain unf5023 are, respectively, predicted to encode a 55 kda polypeptide with a putative nucleotide-binding site, and a highly hydrophobic 44 kda polypeptide that probably spans the cytoplasmic membrane several times. expression of pule in minicells or under the control of a strong bacteriophage t7 promoter resulted in  the production of a c. 58 kda cytoplasmic protein. a representative pule-beta-galactosidase hybrid protein created by tnlac mutagenesis was also found mainly in the cytoplasm. these results are in line with the predicted absence from pule of a region of sufficient hydrophobicity to function as a signal sequence. the pulf polypeptide could not be detected either in minicells or when the gene was transcribed from the t7 promoter, but the acquirement of three pulf-lacz gene fusions that encoded hybrid proteins with relatively high levels of beta-galactosidase activity indicates that this gene can be transcribed and translated. gene disruption experiments indicated that both pule and pulf are required for pullulanase secretion in escherichia coli k-12. both proteins exhibit considerable homology throughout their entire lengths with other proteins involved in protein secretion, pilin assembly, conjugation and transformation competence in a variety of bacteria. in addition, pule protein has consensus sequences found in a wide variety of nucleotide-binding proteins. this study completes the initial characterization of the pullulanase secretion gene operon,  which comprises 13 genes that are all essential for the transport of pullulanase  across the outer membrane.

AB  == this study was aimed at recognition of frequency of occurrence of p fimbriae in strains of escherichia coli isolated from samples of feces of children with symptoms of diarrhoea and at search of these adhesions in strains representing other than escherichia genera of enterobacteriaceae strains. one hundred forty laboratory strains were investigated. they belonged to genus citrobacter, enterobacter, hafnia, klebsiella, morganella, proteus, providencia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia. also were tested 1277 colonies of enteric rods isolated from the macconkey's medium inoculated with samples of feces from 163 children with symptoms of diarrhoea. mannose-resistant active hemagglutination test was performed with human group o erythrocytes and guinea pig erythrocytes stabilized  with glutaraldehyde. presence of p fimbriae was detected by the slide latex test  with latex covered by p1 glycoprotein. among 140 laboratory strains of enterobacteriaceae in 21 strains (3-e. cloaceae, 2-hafnia, 13-k. pneumoniae, 2-p. rettgeri and in one strains of providencia) presence of mrha adhesins was demonstrated. nine of these strains (2-hafnia, 5-k. pneumoniae and 2-p. rettgeri) reacted specifically in the latex test. among 1142 colonies of e. coli isolated from children with symptoms of diarrhoea, 326 colonies belonged to 13 epec serotypes. with 118 (36.2%) of epec colonies a positive result of mrha reaction was found with human erythrocytes and 34 (10.4%) with guinea pig erythrocytes. positive latex test was obtained with 77 (23.6%) colonies. all these colonies possessed mrha adhesins. remaining 816 colonies of e. coli strains did not represent microorganisms belonging to serotypes accepted as enteropathogenic. from 112 (13.7%) colonies out of 816 not belonging to epec, positive results was  obtained in the mrha test with human erythrocytes and this was the case also with 41 (5.0%) colonies in mrha reaction with application of guinea pig erythrocytes.  the latex test was positive in 65 (7.9%) colonies of e. coli. from remaining 135  colonies other than e. coli, positive result of latex test of presence of p fimbriae was obtained with 54 (40.0%) colonies, including 14 colonies of e. cloacae, 23-k. pneumoniae and 17-k. oxytoca. in all these strains presence of mrha adhesins was demonstrated. these investigations demonstrated that among epec strains significantly more frequently, than not belonging to these serotypes of e. coli, mrha adhesins, including p fimbriae was observed.(abstract truncated at  400 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == characterisation of a pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility gene and evidence for a specialised protein export system widespread in eubacteria.
AB  == type-4 fimbriae (pili) are associated with a phenomenon known as twitching motility, which appears to be involved with bacterial translocation across solid  surfaces. pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants which produce fimbriae, but which have lost the twitching motility function, display altered colony morphology and resistance to fimbrial-specific bacteriophage. we have used phenotypic complementation of such mutants to isolate a region of dna involved in twitching  motility. this region was physically mapped to a spei fragment around 20 min on the p. aeruginosa pao chromosome, remote from the major fimbrial locus (around 75 min) where the structural subunit-encoding gene (fima/pila) and ancillary genes required for fimbrial assembly (pilb, c and d) are found. a gene, pilt, within the twitching motility region is predicted to encode a 344-amino acid protein which has strong homology to a variety of other bacterial proteins. these include the p. aeruginosa pilb protein, the comg orf-1 protein from the bacillus subtilis comg operon (necessary for competence), the pule protein from the klebsiella oxytoca (formerly k. pneumoniae) pulc-o operon (involved in pullulanase export),  and the virb-11 protein from the virb operon (involved in virulence) which is located on the agrobacterium tumefaciens ti plasmid. we have also identified other sets of homologies between p. aeruginosa fimbrial assembly (pil) proteins and b. subtilis com and k. oxytoca pul proteins, which suggest that these are all related members of a specialised protein export pathway which is widespread in the eubacteria.

TI  == klebsiella pneumonia in the modern era: clinicoradiographic correlations.
AB  == a classic clinical and radiographic picture of klebsiella pneumonia has emerged in the literature. patients are typically male, older than 48 years, and have a history of chronic alcoholism. the majority of these pneumonias are community acquired. bulging interlobar fissures and cavitation are radiographic findings said to be distinctive for klebsiella pneumonia. we prospectively studied 15 cases of bacteremically proven klebsiella pneumonia and found clinical and radiographic features strikingly different from those described in the literature. immunosuppression (from corticosteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, neutropenia, hematologic malignancy, and transplantation) now rivals alcoholism as the primary risk factor. cases tended to be nosocomial rather than community acquired. neither bulging interlobar fissure nor cavitation was seen in any case. the right upper lobe was involved in 11 of our 15 cases. pneumonia due to klebsiella oxytoca was more likely to be isolated from patients with bilateral infiltrates, while klebsiella pneumoniae was more likely in patients with unilateral infiltrates.

AB  == 482 klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains isolated from different sources  (human clinical material, feces of healthy subjects, sewage) were investigated for expression of ms-(mannose-sensitive) and mr/k-(mannose-resistant, klebsiella-like) hemagglutinins. regardless of the source of isolation, the majority of k. pneumoniae strains induced mannose-sensitive hemagglutination, but very few k. oxytoca isolates produced this type of hemagglutinin. in both species, most strains induced mr/k-hemagglutination. in general, environmental isolates showed a lesser incidence in production of each hemagglutinin and a higher percentage of non-hemagglutinating strains than fecal and clinical strains. these results suggest clinical isolates to be phenotypically more related to fecal than to environmental strains.

TI  == klebsiella bacteremia: a review of 196 episodes during a decade (1980-1989).
AB  == this report reviews 196 episodes of klebsiella bacteremia in 194 patients during  a 10-year period (1980-1989) in a community teaching hospital in the usa. the median age of patients was 70 years with a mode of 84 years. the prevalence was 0.76 episodes/1000 admissions. nosocomial acquisition of bacteremia occurred in 43% of episodes and 16% of patients were from nursing homes. klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 86% and k. oxytoca for 13% of episodes. most isolates were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin but susceptible to other antimicrobial agents tested. 55 episodes (28%) were polymicrobial; escherichia coli and enterococci were the most common co-isolates. the major portals of entry were the respiratory tract and urinary tract. the majority of patients had major  underlying conditions. the overall mortality was 37%. factors that adversely influenced the mortality rate were nosocomial bacteremia, polymicrobial bacteremia, respiratory tract as the portal of entry, rapidly fatal and ultimately fatal underlying conditions, septic shock, severe leukopenia, increases in total serum bilirubin level or serum creatinine level and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == difficulties in identifying klebsiella strains of clinical origin.
AB  == two hundred and four strains of gram-negative bacteria of clinical origin, initially identified as klebsiella using the api 20 e system, and 10 reference strains were further analysed with the api 20 ec test system and the api 50 ch, api 50 ao, api 50 aa assimilation systems. four clusters corresponding to the species klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. planticola, and k. terrigena were formed after numerical analysis of 155 selected tests and the 26 most discriminating tests were determined. a comparison was made between conventional identification using the api 20 e system and the results of the numerical analysis. the conventional method resulted in incorrect identification  of 13% of the strains tested, especially for the new species: k. planticola and k. terrigena. after numerical analysis, 17 out of 204 strains (8.3%) of clinical  origin were identified as k. planticola. only 1 strain of clinical origin was identified as k. terrigena, and 1 strain as k. ornithinolytica.

AB  == 653 11 beer mugs rinsed mechanically by conveyor belt dishwashing machines and 182 mugs cleaned in open vats were investigated for their content of faecal and total coliforms. ten and more faecal coliform germs could be detected in 4.7% of  the mechanically rinsed tankards and in 12.1% of those cleaned in open vats. respectively, ten and more total coliforms were found in 30.3% and in 67.6%. altogether 213 coliform strains as defined by the german drinking water regulation were characterised biochemically by the api 20 e-system and by their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents. a total of 19 different species from eight genera could be differentiated, whereas 12 strains were unidentifiable by the applied system. klebsiella oxytoca was the most frequently encountered germ,  followed by enterobacter cloacae, k. pneumoniae and ent. sakazakii. 59 of the 213 strains were fully susceptible to all antibiotics used. 44 strains, however, revealed complete or moderate resistance against three and more agents. these results indicate that unhygienic dishwashing procedures may play a decisive role  in the epidemiology of clinically relevant and multiresistant germs.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter in human periodontitis.
AB  == this study examined the occurrence of non-oral gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods in advanced adult periodontitis. speciation and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the microscan micromethod system. a total of 42 taxa of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter were isolated from 427 of 3,050 (14.0%) patients. in 159 (5.2%) patients, these organisms comprised more than 5% of the cultivable subgingival microflora. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter agglomerans accounted for more than 50% of all strains isolated. virtually all study strains demonstrated high in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to 18 other antimicrobial agents tested. in 3 "refractory" periodontitis patients heavily infected with enteric rods, systemic ciprofloxacin therapy (500 mg bid for 10 days) led to resolution of the subgingival infections and improved clinical periodontal status. the present findings indicate that 5% of severe periodontitis lesions may harbor high levels of non-oral, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods. systemic ciprofloxacin appears to be capable of eradicating these potential pathogens from deep periodontal pockets.

TI  == phenotypic properties of klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca isolated from different sources.
AB  == 474 klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains isolated from different sources  (human clinical material, feces of healthy subjects, sewage) were investigated for phenotypic properties. characteristics analyzed were cultural activities, antimicrobial susceptibilities and capsule types. comparison of both species revealed differences in adonitol fermentation and resistance to tetracycline, nalidixic and pipemidic acid. capsule types 2, 7 and 33 were frequently found in  k. pneumoniae, but not in k. oxytoca. on the other hand, k 66 was common in k. oxytoca, but not in k. pneumoniae. with regard to the source of isolation, clinical strains of both species proved to be more resistant to mezlocillin, azlocillin and cephalothin than fecal and sewage strains. similarly, resistances  of k. pneumoniae to cotrimoxazole, nalidixic and pipemidic acid were most frequent in clinical strains. multiple drug resistances were found most often in  clinical isolates. biochemically, different frequencies of positive reactions for urease, lysine decarboxylase activity and acetoin production were found between the groups. capsule typing demonstrated k2 and k7 in k. pneumoniae and k55 and k66 in k. oxytoca to be more common in clinical and fecal isolates than in sewage strains. while cultural characteristics did not allow discrimination of strains from different sources, capsule typing indicated clinical isolates to be more phenotypically related to strains from feces than to sewage isolates.

AB  == isolates of escherichia coli (n = 12), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 10) were used to challenge involuting mammary glands at 7 d of the dry period. bacteria were selected for challenge on the basis of their ability to grow in a pooled source of dry cow secretion obtained at 21 d of involution. challenge bacteria were classified as highly adapted (in vitro growth greater than 7 cfu log10/ml) or poorly adapted (growth less than 2 cfu log10/ml)  for growth in dry cow secretion. intramammary infusion of escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, and k. oxytoca resulted in 0, 40, and 30%, respectively, of quarters  infected. isolates highly adapted for growth in dry cow secretion caused 75% of k. pneumoniae and 67% of k. oxytoca experimental intramammary infections. results indicated that the ability to overcome inhibitory properties of dry cow secretion was related to the establishment of k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca intramammary infections in the dry gland. there was no evidence that growth of e. coli in dry  cow secretion related to pathogenicity in the dry gland. experimental challenge using multiple isolates did confirm the resistance of the involuting mammary gland to e. coli infection.

AB  == recent reports that members of the family enterobacteriaceae that produce high levels of certain beta-lactamases are often resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate  prompted this study to assess the relationship between type and amount of enzyme  produced and susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam,  and cefoperazone-sulbactam. agar dilution mics were determined by using 73 strains of enterobacteriaceae that produced a single beta-lactamase that had been characterized and quantified and a beta-lactamase-negative control strain of escherichia coli. for e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, mics of each combination increased as levels of tem, shv-1, or class iv enzymes increased. however, the percentage of strains that were resistant was highest for ticarcillin-clavulanate (32%), with only 18 and 6% resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam, respectively. strains producing pse-1, regardless of level, were resistant or moderately susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate but were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. hms-1 and ohio-1 beta-lactamases were associated with resistance to ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, respectively. high levels of class iv enzymes in klebsiella oxytoca were associated with resistance to all three combinations. these results indicate that the level and type of beta-lactamase produced by members of the family enterobacteriaceae are important determinants of susceptibility to beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations, especially ticarcillin-clavulanate.

TI  == growth of gram-negative bacteria in dry cow secretion.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria (n = 192) isolated from infected bovine mammary glands were tested for growth in a pooled source of dry cow secretion. growth of klebsiella pneumoniae in dry cow secretion was greater than growth of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. escherichia coli originating during the early dry period exhibited greater growth in dry cow secretion than those originating around calving or during lactation. klebsiella pneumoniae growth did not differ with time of origin of intramammary infection. escherichia coli, k. oxytoca, and  k. pneumoniae growth in a synthetic medium was reduced by apolactoferrin plus ig. growth reduction was greatest for e. coli. citrate reversed growth inhibition. the inhibitory properties of dry cow secretion for e. coli may contribute to the  low number of naturally occurring intramammary infections originating during the  early part of the dry period. inhibitory properties of dry cow secretion are partially explained by lactoferrin acting in conjunction with antibody to prevent iron acquisition by many gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the antibacterial activity in vitro of meropenem was compared with another carbapenem, imipenem, the penem hre 664, and ceftazidime. mics were not influenced by ph nor by inoculum size below 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml: higher inocula caused a modest increase in mic. cation supplementation of mueller-hinton broth was without effect. meropenem was more active than imipenem and the other comparative agents against the majority of gram-negative species (in particular proteus, providencia, morganella, haemophilus, neisseria and pseudomonas aeruginosa, including isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis). against gram-positive organisms, the activity of meropenem was equal to or slightly less  that of imipenem. neither meropenem nor imipenem were influenced by the extended  spectrum beta-lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins produced by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca or serratia marcescens.

TI  == psychrotrophic, proteolytic and lipolytic properties of enterobacteriaceae isolated from milk and dairy products.
AB  == most of the enterobacteriaceae strains (73 out of 75) isolated in a previous study (wessels et al., 1988) were psychrotrophic on agar plates, with the exception of enterobacter cloacae strains. the enterobacteriaceae strains were largely non-proteolytic on milk agar medium although limited numbers of e. cloacae, serratia rubidaea and klebsiella oxytoca strains were capable of proteolytic activity at 25 degrees c. the e. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains positive at 25 degrees c were also proteolytic at 7 degrees c. most of the species tested were non-lipolytic on victoria blue butterfat agar. the majority of serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae strains and a minority of e. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains, however, were lipolytic on this medium.

TI  == in-vitro activity of fce 22101 and other beta-lactam antibiotics against enterobacteriaceae resistant to third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of fce 22101 was compared with those of imipenem, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and latamoxef against 225 enterobacteriaceae (209 clinical isolates and 16 derivatives of escherichia coli k12) chosen for their resistance (mic greater than or equal to 8 mg/l) to third-generation cephalosporins. the beta-lactamases produced by the strains of enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and esch. coli were identified. the mean mics of fce 22101 were 2-8 mg/l for ent. cloacae, citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii. for ent. cloacae, the mics were slightly higher for the cephalosporinase non overproducing (5.5-8 mg/l) than for the cephalosporinase overproducing (4.5 mg/l) strains. the mean mic was 9 mg/l for serratia spp. but for half of the strains the mics were greater than or equal to 16 mg/l. the mics  of fce 22101 were 0.5-1 mg/l for the resistant clinical isolates or isogenic derivatives of k. pneumoniae and esch. coli producing extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (shv-2, shv-3 or ctx-1), whether measured in the presence of clavulanate or not, and against the sensitive controls. this showed that the compound was not affected by these new beta-lactamases. the mics of imipenem, on  the average four to five times lower than those of fce 22101, were found to be very similar for resistant and sensitive strains. the mics of aztreonam were high (32-128 mg/l) for c. freundii, k. oxytoca and cephalosporinase overproducing strains of ent. cloacae. there was cross-resistance between the third-generation  cephalosporins, but the mics of latamoxef remained low (1 mg/l) against m. morganii, klebsiella spp. and esch. coli.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, sm-7338.
AB  == sm-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family enterobacteriaceae at mics of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. it was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species were inhibited by less  than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. sm-7338 inhibited staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates mics were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. group a, b, and c streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. there was no major inoculum size effect, and the mbcs were within a dilution of the mics. sm-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid ph under anaerobic conditions. plasmid beta-lactamases of tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, shv-1, shv-2, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, oxa-2, oxa-3, oxa-4, oxa-5, and oxa-7; staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases p-99 and k-1;  morganella species; and proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze sm-7338. the repeated  transfer of organisms increased the mics of sm-7338, as it did the mics of imipenem.

TI  == prevention of clinical coliform mastitis in dairy cows by a mutant escherichia coli vaccine.
AB  == a prospective cohort study was undertaken in two commercial california dairies. the treatment group, 246 cows, received three doses of a whole cell bacterin of j5 escherichia coli (mutant of e. coli o111:b4) plus freund's incomplete adjuvant vaccine (two in the dry period and one after calving) while 240 unvaccinated cows served as controls. thirty-five cases of clinical coliform mastitis were diagnosed, six in vaccinated cows and 29 in unvaccinated cows. bacteria isolated  from the clinical cases included 15 e. coli five klebsiella pneumoniae, three k.  oxytoca, three k. ozaenae, five enterobacter aerogenes, three serratia marcescens and one serratia spp. four control cows were culled, three of them because of chronic coliform mastitis and one because of postcoliform infection agalactia. incidence rate of clinical gram-negative mastitis was 2.57% in vaccinated cows and 12.77% in unvaccinated cows. the estimated risk ratio, the measure of risk of having clinical gram-negative mastitis for vaccinated cows to unvaccinated cows,  was 0.20 (p less than 0.005), indicating a strong relationship between vaccination and lack of clinical gram-negative mastitis. the results of this trial indicate that the administration of the e. coli j5 vaccine is protective against natural challenge to gram-negative bacteria, and reduces the incidence of clinical gram-negative mastitis in dairy cows during the first three months of lactation.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase gene of klebsiella oxytoca e23004, a strain resistant to cefoperazone and aztreonam, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the molecular mass and pi of this enzyme were 28 kilodaltons and 7.4, respectively. although the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca hydrolyzed many cephalosporins, including broad-spectrum drugs, the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence lacked homology with chromosomal class c beta-lactamase genes (ampc) of e. coli or citrobacter freundii. rather, about 45% nucleotide sequence homology and 40% deduced amino acid sequence homology were observed between the k. oxytoca beta-lactamase and tem-1, a class a beta-lactamase which does not efficiently hydrolyze cephalosporins. values of km, relative vmax, and relative vmax/km for the k. oxytoca beta-lactamase indicated that the enzyme is a penicillinase but that it can hydrolyze cefoperazone effectively and other broad-spectrum cephems weakly. hence, the chromosomal beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca e23004 belongs to class a but differences in its amino acid sequence provide a broader spectrum of activity.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == immunological comparison of constitutive beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria by neutralization in zymogram gels: properties of anti-tem-1 and anti-tem-2 sera.
AB  == the zymogram technique was applied to a beta-lactamase neutralization assay with  anti-tem-1 and anti-tem-2 sera. both were shown to contain neutralizing antibodies directed towards various beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria. the quantitative neutralization allowed classification into five groups of the 28 beta-lactamases used as standards and 61 from clinical isolates. in the first were enzymes such as tem-1 and tem-2 including tle-1, shv-1, shv-2, penicillinases of klebsiella pneumoniae and ctx-1. partial neutralization distinguished two groups containing the carb group of enzymes, which are different from pse-2 and pse-3, and the mal penicillinases of levinea malonatica, which are different from l. amalonatica enzymes. broad spectrum beta-lactamases of k. oxytoca constituted a unique group of partially neutralized enzymes. among  the beta-lactamases not neutralized by either serum were the plasmid-mediated oxa-enzymes, various species-specific beta-lactamases and cephalosporinases. the  antigenic similarities of the enzymes appeared to correlate with the extent of similarities of their catalytic properties, namely those of penicillinases. such  comparisons between the beta-lactamase groups provide an indirect approach to the physiological and structural analysis of established and recently evolved beta-lactamases.

TI  == epidemiology of fecal strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in 22 neonatal wards and influence of antibiotic policy.
AB  == the gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. more than 600 distinct phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. the colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. the major (m) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), e. coli (4 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among m strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. despite the fact that m strains of klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. it thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of  certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.

TI  == kinetic properties of two plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases from klebsiella pneumoniae with strong activity against third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == we determined the kinetic constants for two plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases with strong activity against third-generation cephalosporins: ctx-1 and shv-2. the enzymes had many similar properties: their synthesis was constitutive and they were significantly active against penicillins as well as cephalosporins. the two  enzymes thus differed considerably from the chromosomal cephalosporinases, but bore some resemblance to the commonly-encountered plasmid-coded penicillinases, such as tem beta-lactamases. moreover, like the tem enzymes, the plasmid-mediated ctx-1 and shv-2 enzymes were highly sensitive to the action of the inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam. these inhibitors protected cefotaxime from hydrolysis by these enzymes. both ctx-1 and shv-2 lacked activity against the cephamycins, cefoxitin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefotetan. the ctx-1 and shv-2 enzymes had a low activity against oxacillin and were not sensitive to chloride ions. thus, they were not related to the oxa type beta-lactamases. for the third-generation cephalosporins the rates of hydrolysis were high and thus bore no relation with those observed for the other presently-known beta-lactamases, with perhaps the exceptions of those produced by k. oxytoca. imipenem was very resistant to the action of these ctx-1 and shv-2 beta-lactamases.

TI  == the use of purine compounds as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen by klebsiella  species.
AB  == sixty-one strains of enterobacteriaceae were tested for purine assimilation, including twenty-five klebsiella pneumoniae, seventeen k. oxytoca and nineteen others. only k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca were able to use guanosine triphosphate, xanthine, hypoxanthine, or uric acid as sole sources of carbon and  nitrogen. when guanosine triphosphate was used as sole source of nitrogen and carbon, the lag phase was prolonged. the addition of glucose did not affect the maximum number of viable cells for k. pneumoniae atcc 29665, but produced an increase for strain k. oxytoca atcc 13030. in the case of uric acid, atcc 29665 had a more distinct lag phase of growth than atcc 13030. apart from this, they appeared to be very similar. on solid chemically defined gtp medium, some strains of klebsiella were able to produce a water-soluble brown pigment.

TI  == use of chromatofocusing for separation of beta-lactamases. viii. analytical chromatofocusing of chromosomal cephalosporinases from four klebsiella strains.
AB  == although still there are klebsiella strains which do not harbour plasmids and produce constitutive chromosomal beta-lactamases, recently clinical isolates were found in ever increasing numbers carrying mainly tem-, carb- and oxa type r-factors. we selected four chromosomal cephalosporinase producing klebsiella strains to study the pi values of the enzymes and their simultaneous separability from accompanying proteins by chromatofocusing techniques. we compared pi values  of the pure and the crude preparations: k. pneumoniae k1 sc 10436: pipure = 6.4,  picrude = 6.42; k. aerogenes k1 1082 e: pipure = 6.5, picrude = 6.5; k. oxytoca 1082 e: pipure = 6.42, picrude = 6.4; k. oxytoca 20: pipure = 7.62, picrude = 7.6. excellent agreement of the pi values among each other, but occasional differences with those obtained by analytical isoelectrofocusing are attributed to methodological diversities and to the presence of satellite enzymes, known to  exist in klebsiella.

AB  == cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at  concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to  hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == [effects of beta-lactamases on the antibacterial activity of carumonam and aztreonam against klebsiella sp. in comparison with 4 other beta-lactams].
AB  == carumonam and aztreonam are two similar monocyclic beta lactam antibiotics. we have studied their antibacterial activities on klebsiella, in comparison with cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefotetan and imipenem. in the case of k. pneumoniae (53 strains) the antibacterial activities of the two monobactams are very similar. on the contrary, with k. oxytoca (22 strains) carumonam is significantly more active. this situation seems to be justified by an improved stability of carumonam to beta lactamases. in addition, the antibacterial activities of imipenem and of cephamycins remain quite constant within all the strains. then the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime is fluctuant, which is in relation with  a clear susceptibility to the klebsiella beta lactamases.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the nifla operon of klebsiella oxytoca ng13 and characterization of the gene products.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the regulatory operon nifla of a nitrogen fixer klebsiella oxytoca ng13 was determined, and the transcriptional start point was assigned by s1 mapping. the nifl protein (a repressor) was coded by an open reading frame of 1,485 bases, corresponding to a protein of 495 amino acids with  a calculated molecular weight of 55,242. the open reading frame (1,572 bases) of  the nifa protein (an activator), corresponding to a molecular weight of 58,649, was confirmed by in vitro transcription-translation experiments, using the wild type and artificially deleted nifa genes. the initiation codon (atg) of nifa overlapped the termination codon(tga) of nifl, sharing the two bases t and g. a conserved dna contact point [gln-(x)3-ala-(x)3-gly-(x)5-val] common in many dna binding proteins was found in the c-terminal region of the nifa sequence. the promoter sequences of nifla, nifb and niff in k. oxytoca coincided exactly with those of k. pneumoniae in the consensus regions at -12 and -26, although the overall homology in the promoter regions was 96%. changes of four amino acids were found between the nifa coding sequences of k. oxytoca and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == phenotypic characteristics of coliform and noncoliform bacteria from a public water supply compared with regional and national clinical species.
AB  == during the summer and fall of 1984, elevated total coliform counts were observed  in the distribution system of a public water supply serving 350,000 people in south central connecticut. as part of an investigation of possible health risks associated with the presence of bacteria in the water supply, bacterial isolates  from the distribution system were compared with bacterial isolates of the same species obtained from a large regional teaching hospital and from a national compendium of clinical isolates. characteristics analyzed included phenotypic metabolic activity, antimicrobial susceptibilities to clinically utilized antibiotics, temperature tolerance at 44.5 degrees c, and beta-glucuronidase activity in single-test form and on a selective medium. environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter agglomerans from all sources were temperature tolerant and yielded positive fecal coliform tests. only e. coli showed beta-glucuronidase activity (both in a single biochemical test and on a selective medium). no single characteristic analyzed was sufficient to establish an organism as either environmental or clinical in origin.

TI  == [klebsiella oxytoca beta-lactamases: study of their action on 3d-generation cephalosporins].
AB  == indole-positive klebsiella pneumoniae or k. oxytoca are usually resistant to penicillins as a result of the production of a chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamase with a low level of synthesis (specific activity approximately 50  to 100 mu/mg). although most strains are susceptible to the majority of cephalosporins, some strains exhibit resistance to cephalosporins including third-generation drugs. these resistant strains produce a chromosomally-mediated  beta-lactamase with a high level of synthesis (specific activity approximately 5,000 mu/mg or higher). four beta-lactamases have been identified on the basis of their isoelectric points: pi = 5.5, 5.7, 6.0 and 6.3; nevertheless they have similar kinetic constants, and are inhibited by clavulanic acid. these enzymes hydrolyze most third-generation cephalosporins, in the following order of decreasing velocities: cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefodizime, cefpirome; ceftazidime, and cefoxitin, cefotetan, latamoxef, cephamycins which are totally resistant to these enzymes.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  == cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. in this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men,  6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high  performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal activity (sba) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. the mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. at eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. the total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. up to ten hours, the sba of ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. at one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a sba of 1:4 for staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the addition of netilmicin, median sba against staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. netilmicin enhanced  the sba of ceftazidime. the combination was not effective against streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

AB  == all strains of staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). augmentin is active  against penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. according to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "rsr" and "rrr" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are  chiefly found among enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter and indole + proteus; in  these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of proteus vulgaris strains. "rrs" and "rri" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == new, simple medium for selective recovery of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca from human feces.
AB  == a culture medium was developed which selectively favored the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca in escherichia coli-rich fecal cultures, without the use of antibiotics. the discriminative capacity of this medium was based on the presence of only two carbon sources, citrate and inositol, which can be utilized by nearly all k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca strains but not by e. coli. the medium consisted of simmons citrate agar (sca) with 1% inositol (scai). klebsiella strains from fecal samples subcultured on scai grew unhampered as yellow, dome-shaped, often mucoid colonies, whereas e. coli appeared as tiny, watery colonies. apart from some enterobacter strains, no other types of bacteria were found to mimic the typical appearance of klebsiellae. recovery experiments from stool samples revealed a limiting ratio of klebsiella to e. coli of 1:10(6)  or more when samples were plated on scai versus ratios of 1:10(2) to 1:10(3) on blood agar or macconkey agar. compared with an existing klebsiella culture method, the combination of sca and macconkey-inositol-carbenicillin (mic) agar, klebsiella yields with scai were not lower than those with the combination of mic and sca. furthermore, the efficiency of the scai method was twice that of the latter combination. the scai plate could be a valuable tool in studies on the epidemiology of k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, for example in nosocomial infections, especially those concerning immunocompromised patients.

AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin b nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. the susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. the strains included representatives of escherichia coli with different o- and k-antigens, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, salmonella typhimurium, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  pseudomonas maltophilia. in contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin b nonapeptide.

TI  == hemagglutinins of klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the occurrence and characteristics of hemagglutinins were investigated in 310 klebsiella strains (195 k. pneumoniae- and 115 k. oxytoca-strains). mannose-sensitive (ms)-hemagglutinins as well as mannose-resistant (mr/k)-hemagglutinins could be demonstrated, only 13 klebsiella-strains were not  able to hemagglutinate. ms-hemagglutinins were much more often found in k. pneumoniae- than in k. oxytoca-strains, whereas the mr/k-hemagglutinin-frequency  was equally high. features (resistance to formaldehyde, trypsin, pronase, glycosidases, sodium metaperiodate and heating) and pathogenic significance of these hemagglutinins (fimbriae) were discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of ropy bacteria in raw milk.
AB  == approximately 4.2% of 4,000 maryland-virginia raw milk tanker samples developed ropiness when incubated at 10 degrees c. of the 56 bacterial isolates 30 were identified by species. klebsiella oxytoca and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated most frequently. other ropy isolates were identified as pseudomonas spp., chromobacterium, flavobacterium multivorum, presumptive yersinia pestis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pasteurella-actinobacter spp. six of the klebsiella oxytoca isolates were mesophilic (optimum temperatures of 32.0 to 37.8 degrees c) with two isolates having psychrotrophic tendencies (optimum temperature of 26.8 degrees c). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates appeared to be psychrotropic in their temperature requirements (optimum temperature of 23.0 to 31.0 degrees c). klebsiella oxytoca was significant in preliminary development of the ropy condition. all klebsiella oxytoca isolates developed ropiness within 24 h. the pseudomonas spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates required at long as 7 days to develop detectable ropiness at 10 degrees  c. a recommended klebsiella oxytoca differentiation agar is presented as a rapid  screening method during outbreaks where klebsiella oxytoca is the organism of significance.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on t-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == studies on t-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. peak mic  of t-1982 against s. pyogenes (group a) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. peak mics of t-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against b. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against e. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against k. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. serum levels and urinary excretions of  t-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. when given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of t-1982 attained the peak  level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (t 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form  into urine within 6 hours. 4. twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with t-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis,  bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant e. coli. the efficacy rate was 96.3%. in this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes) and gram-negative rods (h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae p. vulgaris, b. pertussis, s. marcescens, e. coli) were eradicated by the treatment  with t-1982. 6. no noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of got in 1 case.

TI  == management of septicemia in rhesus monkeys with chronic indwelling venous catheters.
AB  == twenty venous-catheterized, septicemic rhesus monkeys from two laboratories were  studied. the most common isolates from the bloodstream were klebsiella oxytoca from the monkeys in one laboratory and staphylococcus aureus from those in the other. five septicemic monkeys from the two laboratories, each with a central venous catheter, received repeated courses of antibiotics to which the infecting  organisms were sensitive. their catheters, however, were not removed. all five monkeys improved clinically, permitting continued use of the catheters. however,  until the catheters were removed, bacteria were isolated repeatedly from the bloodstream. two therapeutic regimens for the management of bacterial septicemia  then were compared. under both regimens, animals with positive blood cultures were treated for 10 days with appropriate antibiotics based on bacterial sensitivity testing. in one group of 10 monkeys, the indwelling venous catheters  remained in situ during treatment. in a second group of 10 monkeys, catheters were removed at the time antibiotic therapy was initiated. when catheters were not removed, septicemia recurred 3 to 5 days after antibiotics were discontinued. in contrast, when catheter removal accompanied antibiotic therapy, resolution of  the septicemia occurred within 3 to 5 days. thus, catheter removal was required for elimination of bacteria from the bloodstream of septicemic monkeys with long-term indwelling central venous catheters.

TI  == [heterogeneity of the fatty acid composition of bacteria in the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, hafnia and serratia].
AB  == the analysis of the chromatograms of methyl esters of fatty acids in bacterial strains of the tribe klebsielleae showed the heterogeneity of the fatty acid composition of bacteria belonging to the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, hafnia  and serratia. the bacteria of this tribe could be subdivided into 5 provisory groups in accordance with the composition and profile of their fatty acids. group i comprised k. pneumoniae k1, k. ozaenae and k. rhinoscleromatis strains forming  a separate group characterized by the absence of cyclopropane fatty acids; group  ii comprised k. pneumoniae strains of other capsular serovars (k2, k8, k11, k13,  k41, k47), as well as k. aerogenes and k. oxytoca strains. the fatty acid composition of the strains of group iii, comprising e. aerogenes and e. cloacae,  was similar to that of e. coli o1; only among the fatty acids of these bacteria acid c20:0 could be detected. h. alvei strains were included into group iv; their fatty acid profiles were similar to those of the genus enterobacter, but had a higher content of acids c15:0 and c18:0. s. marcescens strains were similar to the strains of group ii in their fatty acid composition, but considerably differed from the latter by a higher content of hexadecanoate (c16:0) and a lower level of c18:1; for this reason they were regarded as provisory group v.

TI  == effect of decreased salivation and ph on the adherence of klebsiella species to human buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == to assess the role of reduced salivary flow and intraoral ph on gram-negative bacterial colonization of the oropharynx, we studied in vitro klebsiella adherence to normal human buccal epithelial cells at various ph values and to buccal cells from patients with pathological xerostomia (decreased saliva flow).  reduced ph significantly increased adherence of klebsiella pneumoniae 84 to normal buccal epithelial cells (p less than 0.001). in contrast, two clinical isolates of k. oxytoca showed no significant ph-dependent change in adherence. a  corollary of this was that patients with pathological xerostomia had significantly increased adherence of k. pneumoniae 84 to their buccal epithelial  cells as compared with normal controls (p less than 0.01). these results suggest  that reduced salivary flow and the concomitant reduction of intraoral ph may predispose patients to bacterial colonization with k. pneumoniae.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == [prerequisites for enhancement of the efficacy of fosfomycin by glucose-6-phosphate in treatment of experimentally infected animals (author's transl)].
AB  == in chemotherapy of otherwise fatally infected mice (intraperitoneally) the effective dose50 (ed50) of fosfomycin (2 single doses, subcutaneous application 1 and 6 h post infect.) was decreased significantly by supplementing the antibiotic solution with 100 mg glucose-6-phosphate (g-6-p) per kg animal and per injection  if also the mic of the infecting strain (klebsiella oxytoca and k. aerogenes ii)  was lowered by addition of g-6-p (25 mg/l) to the nutrient medium (table 1 and 2). with strains not exhibiting any influence on the mic no such effect was observed (table 1). from this it is concluded that the enhancement of antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vivo is based on the same mechanism as in vitro. this mechanism is the initiation of a second route of transportation into  the bacterial cell (7), the hexose-6-phosphate transport system that apparently is inducible not only in vitro but also in vivo. blood levels of g-6-p sufficient or above to induce this system in vitro (5 mg/l) were being held with doses of 100 mg/kg body weight in dogs during 70 to 120 min (fig. 3) and 45 to 70 min (fig. 4) when applied subcutaneously or intravenously respectively. these periods of contact area adequate to induce a considerable decrease of the mic. with the strain used (k. oxytoca) the mic of 128 mg/l was lowered by contact with g-6-p during 60 or 120 min to 16 or 8 mg/l respectively (fig. 5). for full induction of the hexose-6-phosphate system resulting in a mic of 2 mg/l however, 8 h were necessary. from the above findings it is concluded that clinical studies are necessary. as g-6-p is a (short-lived) physiological product of cell metabolism and nontoxic such studies are justifiable in cases where therapeutic use of fosfomycin can be regarded as an indication.

(i) k. aerogenes was the most common among klebsiella species, k. ozaenae and k. atlantae occurred frequently, k. pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis,  k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca were found rarely. the strains isolated from urine showed the most heterogeneous species distribution. enterobacter species were in  the order of frequency e. cloacae, e. liquefaciens, e. aerogenes. (ii) k. aerogenes strains belonged to 10, k. atlantae strains to 6 phage types; phage type ii.a1 was the most frequent phage types. typability varied between 23.7% and 48.0% with the different klebsiella species, except k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca strains. none of the strains of these species were typable by phages. among the enterobacter species examined, only one e. liquefaciens strain was typable by phages. strains of genus enterobacter were lysed by the diagnostic phage c14 in 64%, no lysis was observed in the strains of genus klebsiella. (iii) multiple resistance was demonstrated in 36.6% of klebsiella strains and in 16.5% of enterobacter strains. the majority of the multiresistant strains was isolated from urine in both genera. multiresistant strains belonged to the species k. aerogenes, e. cloacae and e. liquefaciens. strains resistant to ampicillin were divided into 6 groups on the basis of cephaloridine and cephalothin resistance. the rate of multiresistant strains was higher among the klebsiella and enterobacter strains not typable by phages than in the typable ones.

AB  == altogether 268 strains of klebsiella were investigated with respect to their ability to ferment dulcitol and to produce indole, gelatinase, and brown pigment  on a medium containing gluconate and ferric citrate. in addition the capacity of  the strains to use m-hydroxybenzoic acid as sole source of carbon and energy was  tested. of the 83 indole-positive klebsiella strains 72 (87%) were able to grow on the m-hydroxybenzoic acid medium, whereas only 2 (1%) of the indole-negative strains did so. late liquefaction of gelatin occurred in 66 (80%) of the indole-positive strains. the ability of the indole-positive klebsiella strains to use m-hydroxybenzoic acid as sole carbon source supports the view that these strains should be grouped in a separate taxon, which may be named klebsiella oxytoca; it also provides a simple additional test for the identification of these strains.

TI  == taxonomic position of klebsiella atlantae and klebsiella edwardsii.
AB  == the taxonomic position of two species of the genus klebsiella (k. atlantae and k. edwardsii) is being introduced. 211 strains of different origin were studied: 80  strains of k. pneumoniae, 46 strains of k. oxytoca, 50 strains of k. atlantae and 35 strains of k. edwardsii. sixty biochemical characteristics were determined 40  of these pertaining to carbohydrate metabolism. it was discussed whether both are to be considered species or biotypes of another klebsiella species, however, by determining citrate as carbon source, by mr test and by tests on malonate, gluconate, methyl-xyloside, 1 (--) sorbose, inulin, amylose, methyl-d-mannoside,  glycogen, melezitose, vp test, amygdalin, d-tartrate and gas from glucose, we arrived at the conclusion that both could be considered species of the genus. these conclusions were confirmed by the determination of biotypes of both (according to c. richard). later, we expect to study their participation in human infective processes and their sensitivity by antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [taxonomic study of enterobacteria belonging or related to the genus klebsiella (author's transl)].
AB  == this work studies the classification, by numerical procedure, of 122 strains belonging or related to the genus klebsiella. four classes can be defined: j (= k. pneumoniae: 29 strains for the most isolated from human faeces), k (related to k. pneumoniae and to k. oxytoca: 24 strains isolated from water), l (related to k. pneumoniae although, tetrathionate-reductase+, m-hydrobenzoate+: 37 strains isolated from water or soil), m (= k. oxytoca: 22 strains for the most isolated from water). the importance of the origins of the strains is emphasized.

TI  == [frequency and drug sensitivity of "klebsiella oxytoca" in human clinical material (author's transl)].
AB  == 962 klebsiella strains were isolated from a total of 15422 clinical samples. 782  of these were characterized as the species klebsiella pneumoniae, 170 as "klebsiella oxytoca" and 10 as klebsiella ozaenae. 95 of the klebsiella oxytoca strains originated from samples of the respiratory tract, 13 from purulent materials, 1 from blood and 61 from urine samples. among further biochemical criteria indole formation, lacking gas formation at 45 degrees c in lactose peptone water medium and delayed gelatine liquefaction were used to differentiate klebsiella oxytoca from other enterobacteriaceae. in addition the drug resistance patterns were determined.

TI  == [carbohydrate containing media for the detection of urease in "klebsiella"].
AB  == sone strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca grown on nutrient agar may appear "urease negative" in a ferguson type reagent medium after a 24 h incubation at 37 degrees c. amongst such 147 so called urease negative strains, urease has been detected within a few hours in 79 strains, when bacteria have grown on media containing carbohydrates (kligler iron agar, drigalski lactose agar, ss agar and worfel-ferguson sucrose medium). acid production by carbohydrate fermentation increases urease production by klebsiella: ph 4 is the  most convenient ph for urease synthesis by these bacteria. the other 68 strains have been considered as urease-less klebsiella. the best results are obtained from culture on worfel-ferguson sucrose medium: urea hydrolysis is positive--on an average-after 1 hour and 30 minutes when detected in a ferguson type reagent medium, and after 2 hours and 35 minutes when detected in a christensen reagent medium.
