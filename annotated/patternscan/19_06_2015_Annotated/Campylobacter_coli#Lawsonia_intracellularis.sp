TI  == prevalence of campylobacter spp. relative to other enteric pathogens in grow-finish pigs with diarrhea.
AB  == salmonella spp., lawsonia intracellularis, and brachyspira spp. are pathogens commonly associated with diarrhea in growing and finishing pigs. brachyspira spp. infection has recently reemerged as a significant concern due to an increase in the incidence of swine dysentery; however, the mechanisms underlying this increase in dysentery remain largely unknown. pigs are also well-recognized as potential carriers of campylobacter spp., particularly campylobacter coli, yet enteric disease in swine associated with infection by these bacteria is considered uncommon and diagnosis has historically been based upon exclusion of other causes. accordingly, campylobacter culture is often excluded in routine diagnostic testing of cases of porcine enterocolitis and the incidence of infection is therefore largely unknown. in this study, feces from 155 cases of clinical diarrhea in grow-finish pigs submitted to the iowa state university veterinary diagnostic laboratory were cultured for campylobacter spp. in addition to other testing as indicated for routine diagnostic investigation. campylobacter culture was positive from 82.6% (128/155) of samples with c. coli accounting for  75% of isolates and campylobacter jejuni for the remaining 25%. in 14.8% (23/155) of cases a campylobacter spp. was the sole infectious agent detected; however, there was no association with any particular campylobacter spp. interestingly, for those cases with a laboratory diagnosis of brachyspira-associated disease, 100% (15/15) were also culture positive for campylobacter spp. suggesting a possible interrelationship between these bacteria in the pig gut. no association  was noted between campylobacter culture results and infection with either salmonella spp. or l. intracellularis.

TI  == development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis of porcine proliferative enteropathy.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using a sonicated pure culture of lawsonia intracellularis as the antigen (so-elisa). a total of 332 serum samples, consisting of 232 experimentally infected animals and 100 animals naturally infected with l. intracellularis, were used to assess the diagnostic sensitivity. three hundred and fifty-five sera from uninfected animals were used to determine  the diagnostic specificity. the receiver operating characteristic and mean +3 standard deviation of optical density (od) values from uninfected animals were used for selecting cut-off points. the diagnostic accuracy of so-elisa was considered to be high as the area under the curve index was 0.991 with 0.0029 standard error. the optimal cut-off for so-elisa was set at 0.45 od with 89.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity based on a combination of good sensitivity and  high specificity. no cross-reactivity was found in sera from pigs exposed to brachyspira pilosicoli, b. hyodysenteriae, campylobacter mucosalis, c. jejuni, or c. coli. inter- and intracoefficient of variation of all control sera tested with so-elisa was less than 10%. the observed agreements between so-elisa and the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay tested with experimental challenge animals and field samples were 95.08% with 0.88 kappa and 90.65% with 0.74 kappa value, respectively. so-elisa was able to detect the seroconversion of infected animals  at 2 to 4 weeks after exposure to l. intracellularis. based on the validation results, so-elisa could be used as an alternative serology for proliferative enteropathy diagnosis.

TI  == the comparative importance of e. coli antigen in granulomatous colitis of boxer dogs.
AB  == granulomatous colitis of boxer dogs is characterized by mucosal and submucosal infiltration by abundant large macrophages and lymphocytes and plasma cells. involved intestine is thickened, corrugated and ulcerated. the macrophages that occur in colon, cecum and regional lymph nodes are pas-positive, lipid-rich, contain cholesterol, and some of the time can be seen to hold bacteria. paraffin  tissue blocks of formalin-fixed colon and colic lymph nodes from 10 cases were cut at 5 microm and immunostained by a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique, employing primary antibodies against escherichia coli, e. coli 0157: 2, campylobacter, c. jejuni-coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, salmonella, shigella, pseudomonas and lawsonia intracellularis. the macrophages in the lamina propria and submucosa, as well as those in aggregates in regional lymph nodes, showed immunoreactivity with polyclonal e. coli antibody in all 10 cases. tissues lacking granulomas were negative, as were those reacted with the other eight antibodies, with the exception that there was rare focal staining for campylobacter, lawsonia and salmonella in a few dogs. we believe these results identify the causative agent of this granulomatous disease of boxer dogs, a disease with great histologic and etiologic similarity to granulomatous leptomeningitis of beagle dogs, and malacoplakia and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis of man. macrophages that are immunopositive for e. coli antigen occur in crohn's disease as well, where their significance is less well understood.

TI  == proliferative enterocolitis associated with dual infection with enteropathogenic  escherichia coli and lawsonia intracellularis in rabbits.
AB  == both enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and an obligate intracellular bacterium, previously referred to as an intracellular campylobacter-like organism and now designated lawsonia intracellularis, have been reported as causes of enterocolitis in rabbits. an outbreak of enterocolitis in a group of rabbits, characterized by an unusually high rate of mortality, was found to be associated  with dual infection with epec and l. intracellularis. the epec strain was found to have eaea gene homology but was negative for afra homology. the absence of the afra gene, which encodes the structural subunit for the af/r1 pilus, indicates that this rabbit epec strain is distinct from the prototypic rdec-1 strain. this  finding suggests that rabbit epec strains widely reported in western europe, which lack af/r1 pili, are also present in rabbits in the united states. dual infection with these two pathogens in rabbits has not been previously reported and may have contributed to the unusually high mortality observed in this outbreak.
