TI  == apoprotein isolation and activation, and vibrational structure of the helicobacter mustelae iron urease.
AB  == the micro aerophilic pathogen helicobacter mustelae synthesizes an oxygen-labile, iron-containing urease (urea2b2) in addition to its standard nickel-containing enzyme (ureab). an apoprotein form of the iron urease was prepared from urea2b2-expressing recombinant escherichia coli cells that were grown in minimal  medium. temperature-dependent circular dichroism measurements of holoprotein and  apoprotein demonstrate an enhancement of thermal stability associated with the urea2b2 metallocenter. in parallel to the situation reported for nickel activation of the standard urease apoprotein, incubation of urea2b2 apoprotein with ferrous ions and bicarbonate generated urease activity in a portion of the nascent active sites. in addition, ferrous ions were shown to be capable of reductively activating the oxidized metallocenter. resonance raman spectra of the inactive, aerobically-purified urea2b2 holoprotein exhibit vibrations at 495cm(-1) and 784cm(-1), consistent with nu(s) and nu(as) modes of an fe(iii)ofe(iii) center; these modes undergo downshifts upon binding of urea and were unaffected by changes in ph. the low-frequency mode also exhibits an isotopic shift from 497 to 476cm(-1) upon (16)o/(18)o bulk water isotope substitution. expression of subunits of the conventional nickel-containing klebsiella aerogenes urease in cells grown in rich medium without nickel resulted in iron incorporation into a portion of the protein. the inactive iron-loaded species exhibited a uv-visible spectrum similar to oxidized urea2b2 and was capable of being reductively activated under anoxic conditions. results from these studies more clearly define the formation and unique properties of the iron urease metallocenter.

TI  == bacterial homologue of human blood group a transferase.
AB  == a bacterial version of human blood group a transferase was identified and found to be able to accept five naturally existing h-antigen core structures as good substrates, demonstrating its versatility for synthesis of blood group a antigens. furthermore, this enzyme was applied in the engineering of bacterial cell surface polysaccharides by remodeling blood group b mimicry into blood group a mimicry.

TI  == production and application of new monoclonal antibodies specific for a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to establish monoclonal antibodies that could be used to produce a diagnostic test composed of one kind of monoclonal antibody recognizing a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen. the need to develop such a test  arose from disadvantages of the diagnostic test that uses a polyclonal antibody or plural kinds of monoclonal antibodies, such as the lower specificity for h. pylori antigen and the difficulty of reproduction with consistent quality. mice were immunized with sonicated cells of the coccoid form of h. pylori, and fecal samples from h. pylori-positive subjects were screened by a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (eia) for antibody production from 32 hybridoma clones. the three stable clones produced antibodies (21g2, 41a5, and 82b9) that reacted with  the same soluble antigen. gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular masses of the cellular antigen and the fecal antigen were the same, 260 kda. the  antigen was labile in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat treatments. a single-step direct sandwich eia using a single monoclonal antibody, 21g2, was developed. the eia could detect the antigen in 41 h. pylori clinical isolates and in fecal samples from seven h. pylori-positive subjects. several kinds of helicobacter species (helicobacter felis, helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter mustelae, and helicobacter cinaedi) except h. pylori, major bacteria in feces (campylobacter jejuni, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and escherichia coli), and fecal samples from six h. pylori-negative subjects showed negative results. these results indicate that the new monoclonal antibodies and the new specific eia would be useful as a noninvasive method of diagnosis of h. pylori infection.

TI  == essential role of helicobacter pylori gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase for the colonization of the gastric mucosa of mice.
AB  == constitutive expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (ggt) activity is common  to all helicobacter pylori strains, and is used as a marker for identifying h. pylori isolates. helicobacter pylori ggt was purified from sonicated extracts of  h. pylori strain 85p by anion exchange chromatography. the n-terminal amino acid  sequences of two of the generated endo-proteolysed peptides were determined, allowing the cloning and sequencing of the corresponding gene from a genomic h. pylori library. the h. pylori ggt gene consists of a 1681 basepair (bp) open reading frame encoding a protein with a signal sequence and a calculated molecular mass of 61 kda. escherichia coli clones harbouring the h. pylori ggt gene exhibited ggt activity at 37 degrees c, in contrast to e. coli host cells (mc1061, hb101), which were ggt negative at 37 degrees c. ggt activity was found  to be constitutively expressed by similar genes in helicobacter felis, helicobacter canis, helicobacter bilis, helicobacter hepaticus and helicobacter mustelae. western immunoblots using rabbit antibodies raised against a his-tagged-ggt recombinant protein demonstrated that h. pylori ggt is synthesized in both h. pylori and e. coli as a pro-ggt that is processed into a large and a small subunit. deletion of a 700 bp fragment within the ggt-encoding gene of a mouse-adapted h. pylori strain (ss1) resulted in mutants that were ggt negative yet grew normally in vitro. these mutants, however, were unable to colonize the gastric mucosa of mice when orally administered alone or together (co-infection)  with the parental strain. these results demonstrate that h. pylori ggt activity has an essential role for the establishment of the infection in the mouse model,  demonstrating for the first time a physiological role for a bacterial ggt enzyme.

TI  == cancer-associated strains of helicobacter pylori stimulate dna synthesis in iec-6 cells.
AB  == objective: to determine whether water extracts of helicobacter pylori strains, which express caga, can influence dna synthesis in untransformed intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. design: we used water extracts produced from h. pylori strains (a, b, c), collected from gastric mucosa of gastric cancer patients. strain a was caga+/vaca+ whereas strains b and c were caga+/vaca-. water extracts from helicobacter mustelae and escherichia coli were used as controls. methods: iec-6 cells (small intestinal epithelial cell line from germ-free rats) were incubated with various concentrations of the bacterial extracts for 24 h. the cells were labelled with [3h]methylthymidine for 4 h and thereafter processed for autoradiography. dna synthesis was evaluated by the labelling index (li%). results: water extracts from caga-positive strains of h. pylori, with or without  the capacity to produce vacuolating toxins, increased the li in a dose-related manner (p < 0.05). the water extracts of e. coli significantly increased the li (p < 0.001), whereas the water extracts of h. mustelae did not affect dna synthesis. conclusions: cancer-associated, caga-positive strains of h. pylori stimulate dna synthesis in epithelial cells in vitro, independently of their ability to produce vaca toxin. our findings suggest that unknown mitogenic components of h. pylori may contribute to the increased cell proliferation observed in the histological stages preceding gastric cancer.

TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == protein hpn: cloning and characterization of a histidine-rich metal-binding polypeptide in helicobacter pylori and helicobacter mustelae.
AB  == helicobacter pylori is a human gastrointestinal pathogen involved in gastritis, duodenal ulcers, and gastric neoplasia. this microorganism produces large amounts of a urease which, like all known ureases, has nickel in the active site. we have identified a protein in clinical isolates of h. pylori and an identical protein in the ferret pathogen helicobacter mustelae that strongly binds ni2+ and zn2+. this protein has been named hpn to emphasize its origins in h. pylori and its affinity for nickel. the encoding hpn gene, cloned and expressed in escherichia coli er1793, has an open reading frame (180 bp) that specifies a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 7,077 da and with the same amino-terminal sequence as that of wild-type hpn. the deduced sequence of hpn consists of 60 amino acids, of which 28 (47%) are histidines. the hpn gene does not map with the urease gene  cluster on the h. pylori chromosome. an hpn-negative, isogenic h. pylori strain,  generated by hpn gene deletion and grown on blood agar, had the same urease activity that wild-type cells did. thus, the role of hpn in helicobacters is unknown.

TI  == sepa, the major extracellular protein of shigella flexneri: autonomous secretion  and involvement in tissue invasion.
AB  == in addition to ipa proteins and icsa, which are involved in entry into epithelial cells and intercellular spread, respectively, shigella secretes a 110 kda protein, designated sepa. we report the identification, cloning, and nucleotide sequence determination of the sepa gene, analysis of sepa secretion, and construction and characterization of a sepa mutant. the sepa gene is carried by the virulence plasmid and codes for a 150 kda precursor. upon secretion, which does not involve accessory proteins encoded by the virulence plasmid, the precursor is converted to a mature protein of 110 kda by two cleavages removing an n-terminal signal sequence and a c-terminal fragment. extensive similarities were detected between the sequence of the first 500 residues of mature sepa and the n-terminal region of iga1 proteases from neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae, the tsh haemagglutinin of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli, and the hap protein involved in adhesion and penetration of h. influenzae.  the c-terminal domain of the sepa precursor, which is not present in the secreted protein, exhibits sequence similarity with pertactin of bordetella pertussis and  the ring-forming protein of helicobacter mustelae. construction and phenotypic characterization of a sepa mutant indicated that sepa is required neither for entry into cultured epithelial cells nor for intercellular dissemination. however, in the rabbit ligated ileal loop model, the sepa mutant exhibited an attenuated virulence, which suggests that sepa might play a role in tissue invasion.

TI  == urease-mediated destruction of bacteria is specific for helicobacter urease and results in total cellular disruption.
AB  == the survival of helicobacter mustelae, proteus mirobilis, escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni in the presence of urea and citrate at ph 6.0 was examined.  h. mustelae, which has urease activity similar to h. pylori, had a markedly reduced survival, median 2.5% (0-78%) (p < 0.001) when incubated under these conditions. only 7% of the ammonia produced by h. mustelae urease activity was recovered from the buffer, a similar percentage to that previously reported with  h. pylori. none of the other organisms, all of which had lower urease activity, had impaired survival under these conditions. electron microscopical studies demonstrated extensive structural damage to h. pylori following exposure to urea  and citrate at ph 6.0. this structural damage to the organisms makes it unlikely  that the low recovery of ammonia was due to retention of ammonia within the bacteria and suggests that the ammonia may have been incorporated into glutamate  or other amino acids. incorporation of ammonia into these compounds would deplete the cell of the key metabolic intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate and could thus explain the mechanism of the urease-dependent destruction of the organism.

TI  == identification and molecular characterization of a major ring-forming surface protein from the gastric pathogen helicobacter mustelae.
AB  == the spiral microaerophilic bacterium helicobacter mustelae is linked to gastritis and gastric ulcers in ferrets. electron microscopy of h. mustelae showed the presence of a laterally extensive array of 8.5-nm-diameter rings on the cell surface, which was shown to be composed of a 150kda protein. this protein was purified, and the sequence of 10 amino-terminal residues was determined. polyclonal antibody against the purified 150 kda protein labelled the ring structures on the homologous strain by means of immunogold. cross-reactive proteins were identified in three h. mustelae strains, but not in helicobacter pylori or helicobacter felis. the hsr gene encoding this protein was cloned, and  the protein expressed in escherichia coli independently of vector promoters. the  1519-codon nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined, and comparison with the chemically derived protein sequence indicated a 47-residue leader peptide, and a mature protein with a molecular weight of 152,300. thus the cell surface of h. mustelae differs markedly from other members of the genus helicobacter in being covered by an array of 8.5 nm rings composed of a 150kda protein.

TI  == inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
AB  == helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.

TI  == isolation and biochemical and molecular analyses of a species-specific protein antigen from the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori.
AB  == a protein of mr 26,000 which was present in large quantities in extracts of cells of helicobacter pylori was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography or anion-exchange chromatography. the protein appeared to be associated with the soluble fraction of the cell, and antibodies raised against the protein were reactive with whole-cell lysates of a variety of h. pylori strains in a simple immunodot blot assay. this reaction was species specific. protein sequence determination of the amino terminus and internal cyanogen bromide fragments and amino acid composition analysis were performed. an oligonucleotide derived from these data was used to clone a fragment encoding most of the coding sequence. expression in escherichia coli was dependent on vector promoters. the dna sequence of the fragment was determined. dna probes derived from the cloned fragment hybridized to genomic dna of all h. pylori strains tested, but not to dnas of helicobacter mustelae, wolinella succinogenes, various campylobacter species, and a panel of gram-negative enteric bacteria. the apparent uniqueness of this protein may be exploited for the development of species-specific diagnostics for this gastric pathogen.
