TI  == [an electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  == transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei and edwardsiella tarda. different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. for the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses  by e. coli indigenous strains m-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. this observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
