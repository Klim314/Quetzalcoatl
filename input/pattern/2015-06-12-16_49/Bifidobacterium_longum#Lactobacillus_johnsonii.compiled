TI  - A randomized double-blind trial on perioperative administration of probiotics in  colorectal cancer patients.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether probiotic bacteria, given perioperatively, might adhere to the colonic mucosa, reduce concentration of pathogens in stools, and modulate the local immune function. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in 31 subjects undergoing elective colorectal resection for cancer. Patients were allocated to receive either a placebo (group A, n = 10), or a dose of 10(7) of a mixture of Bifidobacterium longum (BB536) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (La1) (group B, n = 11), or the same mixture at a concentration of 10(9) (group C, n = 10). Probiotics, or a placebo, were given orally 2 doses/d for 3 d before operation. The same treatment continued postoperatively from day two to day four. Stools were collected before treatment, during surgery (day 0) and 5 d after operation. During the operation, colonic mucosa samples were harvested to evaluate bacterial adherence and to assess the phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocyte subsets by surface antigen expression (flow cytometry). The presence of BB536 and La1 was evaluated by the random amplified polymorphism DNA method with specific polymerase chain reaction probes. RESULTS: The three groups were balanced for baseline and surgical parameters. BB536 was never found at any time-points studied. At day 0, La1 was present in 6/10 (60%) patients in either stools or by biopsy in group C, in 3/11 (27.2%) in group B, and none in the placebo group (P = 0.02, C vs A). There was a linear correlation between dose given and number of adherent La1 (P = 0.01). The rate of mucosal colonization by enterobacteriacae was 30% (3/10) in C, 81.8% (9/11) in B and 70% (7/10) in A (P = 0.03, C vs B). The Enterobacteriacae count in stools was 2.4 (log10 scale) in C, 4.6 in B, and 4.5 in A (P = 0.07, C vs A and B). The same trend was observed for colonizing enterococci. La1 was not found at day +5. We observed greater expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and naive and memory lymphocyte subsets in group C than in group A with a dose response trend (C > B > A). Treatment did not affect DC phenotype or activation, but after ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharides, groups C and B had a lower proliferation rate compared to group A (P = 0.04). Moreover, dendritic phenotypes CD83-123, CD83-HLADR, and CD83-11c (markers of activation) were significantly less expressed in patients colonized with La1 (P = 0.03 vs not colonized). CONCLUSION: La1, but not BB536, adheres to the colonic mucosa, and affects intestinal microbiota by reducing the concentration of pathogens and modulates local immunity.
TI  - Reconstitution conditions for dried probiotic powders represent a critical step in determining cell viability.
AB  - AIMS: Resuscitation of dried cultures represents a critical control point in obtaining active and effective probiotic strains. This study examined the effects of various rehydration conditions on the viability of Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La1. METHODS AND RESULTS: Reconstitution conditions for these strains were optimized using a multivariate experimental design approach. Furthermore, using flow cytometry, the cell integrity was followed during reconstitution. By adjusting the pH, availability of a metabolizable sugar, reconstitution duration, powder matrix and ratio of powder to reconstitution solution, the recovery of Bif. longum NCC3001 and Lact. johnsonii La1 following reconstitution was increased eight- and two-fold, respectively, over standard reconstitution in maximum recovery diluent. It was shown that pH had a significant effect on the recovery of Bif. longum NCC3001 and Lact. johnsonii La1. CONCLUSIONS: The recovery of dried probiotic cultures is greatly dependent on the reconstitution conditions. The maximum recovery of 11.7 (10)log CFU g(-1) Bif. longum NCC3001 was achieved at 30-min reconstitution at pH 8, in the presence of 2% L-arabinose and a ratio of 1:100 of powder to diluent. Lact. johnsonii La1 showed highest recovery (9.3 (10)log CFU g(-1)) after reconstitution, when mixed with maltodextrin at pH 4. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To achieve accurate viable probiotic numbers from dried probiotic cultures, the reconstitution conditions should be optimized for the strain used.
TI  - A Mesocosm of Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bifidobacterium longum, and Escherichia coli in the mouse gut.
AB  - The relative contribution of competition and cooperation at the microbe-microbe level is not well understood for the bacteria constituting the gut microbiota. The high number and variability of human gut commensals have hampered the analysis. To get some insight into the question how so many different bacterial species can coexist in the mammalian gut, we studied the interaction between three human gut commensals (Escherichia coli K-12, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533, and Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705) in the intestine of gnotobiotic mice. The bacterial titers and their anatomical distribution were studied in the colonized mice. L. johnsonii achieved the highest cell counts in the stomach, while B. longum dominated the colon. The colon was also the intestinal location in which B. longum displayed the highest number of expressed genes, followed by the cecum and the small intestine. Addition of further bacterial strains led to strikingly different results. A Lactobacillus paracasei strain coexisted, while a second B. longum strain was excluded from the system. Notably, this strain lacked an operon involved in the degradation, import, and metabolism of mannosylated glycans. Subsequent introduction of the E. coli Nissle strain resulted in the elimination of L. johnsonii NCC533 and E. coli K-12, while B. longum NCC2705 showed a transient decrease in population size, demonstrating the dynamic nature of microbe-microbe interactions. The study of such simple interacting bacterial systems might help to derive some basic rules governing microbial ecology within the mammalian gut.
TI  - Fecal microflora of Greek healthy neonates.
AB  - This study aimed to explore, in our geographical region, the development of intestinal microflora and the colonization patterns of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria during the first three months of life and to investigate the effect of the mode of delivery. Fecal specimens from 82 healthy, full-term infants were collected prospectively 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery and subcultured on nonselective and selective media. Identification of isolates was performed by microbiological and molecular methods. For the delivery effect, two groups of vaginally or caesarean-delivered exclusively breast-fed infants were studied. Despite the early high total counts of aerobes and anaerobes, colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was overall limited until 3 months of age. Furthermore, caesarean-delivered infants were less often colonized with lactobacilli at day 4 (4% vs. 59%, p = 0.000) and with bifidobacteria at day 4 (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.015) and 30 (0% vs. 35%, p = 0.042) compared to vaginally delivered ones. No bacterial populations differences were detected to compare colonized infants. Identification results indicated the predominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus paracasei species in neonatal gut microflora up to the first month of life and diversity of Lactobacillus species in vaginally delivered, colonized newborns, at fourth day. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium breve were the most frequently detected Bifidobacterium species in vaginally delivered, breast-fed infants. In conclusion our study revealed a restricted colonization pattern of lactic acid bacteria in Greek infants and a delay in the development of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. microbiota after caesarean section. Further analysis of potential consequences of these findings is required.
TI  - A dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  - A dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. The dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees C, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. The model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (Bifidobacterium animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus kefirgranum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. Five strains were not able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at pH 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. Two strains (Bifidobacterium animalis ATCC 25527 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La-1 NCC 533) showed good survival with both methods. The dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper GI tract transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to pH levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.
TI  - Lactobacillus paracasei normalizes muscle hypercontractility in a murine model of postinfective gut dysfunction.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of probiotics on gut dysfunction in postinfective  irritable bowel syndrome are unknown. We tested whether probiotics influence persistent muscle hypercontractility in mice after recovery from infection with Trichinella spiralis and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Mice were gavaged with Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bifidobacterium longum, or Bifidobacterium lactis in spent culture medium from days 10 to 21 after infection. Additional mice received heat-inactivated Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium, or heat-inactivated Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium. Lactobacilli enumeration, immunohistochemistry, and cytokine detection (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were performed. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium from days 18 to 28 after infection. Contractility was measured on days 21 and 28 after infection. RESULTS: Lactobacillus paracasei, but not Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bifidobacterium lactis, or Bifidobacterium longum, attenuated muscle hypercontractility. This was associated with a reduction in the Trichinella spiralis -associated T-helper 2 response and a reduction in transforming growth factor-beta1, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin E 2 levels in muscle. Attenuation of muscle hypercontractility by Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium was abolished after heat treatment. Improvement of muscle hypercontractility at day 28 after infection was also observed after the administration of Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium from day 18 after infection. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics show strain-dependent attenuation of muscle hypercontractility in an animal model of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. This likely occurs via both a modulation of the immunologic response to infection and a direct effect of Lactobacillus paracasei or a heat-labile metabolite on postinfective muscle hypercontractility. Lactobacillus paracasei may be useful in the treatment of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome.
TI  - The role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - Literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to Helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. Several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill H. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent IL8 release. In vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent H. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. Thirteen clinical trials have been published. In six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. In seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. Trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. Not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. The results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in H. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. Future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
