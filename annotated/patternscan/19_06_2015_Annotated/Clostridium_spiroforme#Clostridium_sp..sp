TI  == coprobacillus catenaformis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new genus and species isolated  from human feces.
AB  == three strains of eubacterium-like isolates from human feces were characterized by biochemical tests and 16s rdna analysis. the phenotypic characteristics of the three strains resembled those of the genus collinsella transferred from the genus eubacterium recently. however, eubacterium-like strains were phylogenetically members of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, and these showed  a specific phylogenetic association with clostridium ramosum and c. spiroforme. c. ramosum and c. spiroforme are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that belong to the genus clostridium, and the g + c contents are 26.0 and 27.4 mol%, respectively. however, the three eubacterium-like strains had g + c contents of 32.1 to 33.1 mol% and were non-spore-forming rods. based on phenotypic characteristics, we can differentiate these species, and furthermore,  a 16s rdna sequence divergence of greater than 9% with a new related genus, coprobacillus, is proposed for the three strains, with one species, coprobacillus catenaformis. the type strain of c. catenaformis is jcm 10604t.
