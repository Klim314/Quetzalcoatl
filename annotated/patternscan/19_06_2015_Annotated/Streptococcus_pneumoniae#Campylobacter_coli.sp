TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == use of genomic dna control features and predicted operon structure in microarray  data analysis: arraylearna - a bayesian approach.
AB  == background: microarrays are widely used for the study of gene expression; however deciding on whether observed differences in expression are significant remains a  challenge. results: a computing tool (arraylearna) has been developed for gene expression analysis. it implements a bayesian approach which is based on the gumbel distribution and uses printed genomic dna control features for normalization and for estimation of the parameters of the bayesian model and prior knowledge from predicted operon structure. the method is compared with two  other approaches: the classical lowess normalization followed by a two fold cut-off criterion and the opwise method (price, et al. 2006. bmc bioinformatics.  7, 19), a published bayesian approach also using predicted operon structure. the  three methods were compared on experimental datasets with prior knowledge of gene expression. with arraylearna, data normalization is carried out according to the  genomic features which reflect the results of equally transcribed genes; also the statistical significance of the difference in expression is based on the variability of the equally transcribed genes. the operon information helps the classification of genes with low confidence measurements. arraylearna is implemented in visual basic and freely available as an excel add-in at http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/arraylearna/ conclusion: we have introduced a novel bayesian model and demonstrated that it is a robust method for analysing microarray expression profiles. arraylearna showed a considerable improvement in  data normalization, in the estimation of the experimental variability intrinsic to each hybridization and in the establishment of a clear boundary between non-changing and differentially expressed genes. the method is applicable to data derived from hybridizations of labelled cdna samples as well as from hybridizations of labelled cdna with genomic dna and can be used for the analysis of datasets where differentially regulated genes predominate.

TI  == [aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  == the diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. during the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. one point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of klebsiella pneumoniae were  producers of this type of b-lactamases. ninety-six point five percent of the 797  isolations of salmonella serotipo enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive  to amoxyline. the gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin b. twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == a survey of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary referral hospital in the united arab emirates.
AB  == published data on antimicrobial resistance are lacking for the united arab emirates (uae). knowledge of local patterns of resistance is essential to optimize guidelines for empirical antimicrobial treatment. awareness of susceptibility patterns in other parts of the world may be important for determining empirical antimicrobial therapy for travelers or patients transferred from abroad. antibiograms from unique isolates of common hospital and community bacteria are described in a tertiary referral hospital in the uae, which had no antimicrobial restrictions and limited resources. antimicrobial resistance rates  were unpredictable and were high for gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, shigella sonnei, campylobacter spp, and also streptococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) comprised less than  5% of s. aureus isolates and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) were not detected during the surveillance period. our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance for the uae and highlight the need for resources for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. one  of the bacteria isolated, a strain of bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an  anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the c. perfringens atcc 13124 used in this study. the anticlostridial factor produced by b. subtilis pb6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees c or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. the optimum growth temperature and optimum ph for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees c and 6.20, respectively. using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the  range from 960 to 983 da. in terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of c. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli.

TI  == analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a japanese hospital.
AB  == prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) genes--tet(l), tet(m), tet(k), tet(o), tet(s), tet(t), and tet(u)--which are known to be distributed to  gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 enterococcus faecalis and 46 enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a japanese hospital. any of the tc(r) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. the tet(m) was detected at highest rates in both e. faecalis (75.0%) and e. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(l), which was harbored in 6.7% of e. faecalis isolates and 30.4%  of e. faecium isolates. the tet(o), tet(s), and tet(t) were detected in e. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(m), while tet(k) and tet(u) were not detected. nucleotide sequences of tet(s) from e. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in listeria monocytogenes. sequences of tet(o) from two e. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. the tet(t), which had been reported only in streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five e. faecalis strains. sequence of the enterococcal tet(t) differed from that of s. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). enterococcal strains with any one tc(r) gene or those with two tc(r) genes showed generally similar mics of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance  level was observed.

TI  == extracellular secretion of polypeptides using a modified escherichia coli flagellar secretion apparatus.
AB  == we developed a modified flagellar type iii secretion apparatus to secrete heterologous polypeptides into the growth medium of escherichia coli. the secretion was facilitated by fusing the 173-bp untranslated dna fragment upstream of the gene flic (encoding flagellin) as well as a transcriptional terminator from flic, into the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest. the polypeptides secreted into the growth medium at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg/l were  from campylobacter jejuni (262 residues in length), streptococcus pneumoniae (434 residues), staphylococcus aureus (115 residues), and n-terminal flic hybrid proteins, for example, the eukaryotic green fluorescent protein (238 residues). the expressed proteins represented >50% of total secreted protein. previously reported protein yields from extracellular secretion of foreign proteins in e. coli have been low, approximately 100 microg/l. the strengths of our method are the concentration and purity of the secreted proteins and its versatility with regard to the proteins' length and origin.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa). subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations  are required to generate clinically important resistance. in these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, which  is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

TI  == human milk glycoconjugates that inhibit pathogens.
AB  == breast-fed infants have lower incidence of diarrhea, respiratory disease, and otitis media. the protection by human milk has long been attributed to the presence of secretory iga. however, human milk contains large numbers and amounts of complex carbohydrates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, mucins, and especially oligosaccharides. the oligosaccharides comprise the third most abundant solid constituent of human milk, and contain a myriad of structures. complex carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases in the mammary  gland; those with homology to cell surface glycoconjugate pathogen receptors may  inhibit pathogen binding, thereby protecting the nursing infant. several examples are reviewed: a fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits the diarrheagenic effect of stable toxin of escherichia coli. a different fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits infection by campylobacter jejuni. binding of streptococcus pneumoniae and of enteropathogenic e. coli to their respective receptors is inhibited by human milk oligosaccharides. the 46-kd glycoprotein, lactadherin, inhibits rotavirus binding and infectivity. low levels of lactadherin in human milk are associated with a higher incidence of symptomatic rotavirus in breast-fed infants. a mannosylated glycopeptide inhibits binding by enterohemorrhagic e. coli. a glycosaminoglycan inhibits binding of gp120 to cd4, the first step in hiv infection. human milk mucin inhibits binding by s-fimbriated e. coli. the ganglioside, gm1, reduces diarrhea production by cholera toxin and labile toxin of e. coli. the neutral glycosphingolipid, gb3, binds to shigatoxin. thus, many complex carbohydrates of  human milk may be novel antipathogenic agents, and the milk glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides may be a major source of protection for breastfeeding infants.

TI  == [hemolytic-uremic syndrome after verotoxin-producing escherichia coli infection].
AB  == the haemolytic uraemic syndrome, first described in 1955 by gasser, is the number one cause of acute renal failure in infants. there are three types of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome: the seasonal epidemic form with prodromic diarrhoea  and generally favourable outcome which usually occurs in infants, a less typical  form without signs of digestive tract involvement and no seasonal prevalence which occurs more readily in older children and sometimes in families has a less  favourable prognosis, and finally drug- or disease-related forms. currently, overall mortality due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome has been reduced to about 4%, usually as a result of damage to the central nervous system. several microorganism, including shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, streptococcus pneumoniae, rickittsiae and certain viruses (coksackiae, influenzae, epstein-barr) have been identified as causative agents. in 1983, digestive tract infection due to an escherichia coli strain producing verotoxin was identified as capable of producing haemolytic uraemic syndrome and more rarely thrombopenic thrombotic purpura. the germ produces two exotoxins (whose effect is accentuated by the e. coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin) which lead to  the glomerular microangiopathy causing haemolytic uraemic syndrome. diagnosis is  based on identification (monoclonal antibodies, elisa, pcr) of the verotoxins themselves or the two encoding genes in stool samples. symptomatic treatment is essential but the effectiveness of antibiotics is still debated. theoretically, antibiotics could worsen the syndrome by increasing endotoxin release from lysed  bacteria, but inversely they could also prevent the syndrome if given early enough. further research is required to acquire precise epidemiological data and  identify animal reservoirs of verotoxin producing e. coli.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == characterization of a new class of tetracycline-resistance gene tet(s) in listeria monocytogenes bm4210.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline (tc)-minocycline (mc)-resistance determinant of plasmid pip811 from listeria monocytogenes bm4210 has been determined. the gene, designated tet(s), was identified by analysis of the start  and stop codons as a coding sequence of 1923 bp, corresponding to a protein with  a calculated m(r) of 72,912. the apparent 68-kda size estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the protein characterized in a cell-free coupled transcription-translation system was in good agreement with the calculated value. the tet(s) gene product exhibits 79 and 72% amino acid identity with tet(m) from streptococcus pneumoniae and tet(o) from campylobacter coli, respectively. the distribution of tet(s) in strains of gram+ and gram- genera resistant to tc (tcr) and mc (mcr) was studied by hybridization under high stringency using a 590-bp intragenic probe. homology with tet(s) was detected in  two clinical isolates of l. monocytogenes isolated in different geographical areas.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == [preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

AB  == resistance to tetracycline in the microaerophilic gram-negative bacterium campylobacter jejuni is plasmid-mediated. a 6.9-kb hindiii dna fragment containing the tetracycline-resistance (tcr) gene (designated teto) from the c. jejuni conjugative plasmid pua466 was cloned into puc8, and the resultant plasmid puoa1 was used to transform escherichia coli to tc resistance. the teto gene was  localized at a 2.0-kb region comprising 0.2-kb and 1.8-kb hincii fragments, and the nucleotide sequences were determined. the protein coding region of teto contained a 1911-bp open reading frame which corresponded to a 72.3-kda protein.  upstream from the start codon were hexanucleotides that resembled the canonical sequences found at the -10 region, -35 region and the ribosome-binding site of the prokaryotic promoter. the teto gene product was expressed utilizing an e. coli-derived in vitro transcription/translation system. the polypeptide had an apparent mr of 68,000. comparison of the amino acid sequences of teto to those of tetm (derived from the gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae) revealed 76% homology. hydrophilicity plot analyses of teto and tetm proteins provided almost  identical profiles. these results clearly support our earlier [taylor et al., j.  bacteriol. 169 (1987) 2984-2989] suggestion that tcr determinants found in gram-positive bacteria and in c. jejuni may have a common ancestry.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of apha-3 genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant apha-3 encoded by transposon tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pjh1 and pip1433 from streptococcus faecalis and campylobacter  coli, respectively. the three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid psh2 from staphylococcus aureus. comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the apha-3 gene in pjh1 and in tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pip1433. in the latter plasmid, apha-3 is transcribed from a promoter, p1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. the rearrangement observed in pjh1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of p1. the promoter thus generated. p1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as p1. however, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical  promoter p1 is significantly less efficient than p1'. from analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in  strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. the transition from pip1433 to pjh1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the apha-3 gene. the deletion event in tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed p1 in  its entirety.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotiam (ctm) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of ctm by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute  bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid  fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pyogenes (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (4), haemophilus influenzae (4), escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1), salmonella typhi (1), and campylobacter jejuni (1). all but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the ctm therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of got and gpt (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with  the ctm therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum ctm level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was  rapid. csf concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of ctm in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the csf/serum ratio was 9.0%. from these data, ctm appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
