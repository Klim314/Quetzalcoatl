TI  == coryneform bacteria in throat cultures of healthy individuals.
AB  == throat swabs from 113 healthy individuals from hamburg, germany, and zurich, switzerland, were investigated for coryneform bacteria with nonselective and selective media. ninety specimens contained 123 strains. surprisingly, 76% of them were strains of corynebacterium durum (47%) and rothia dentocariosa (29%). only two were strains of corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and none were strains of c. striatum, c. amycolatum, or c. diphtheriae.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  == cellular fatty acid (cfa) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees c. the organisms could be divided into two groups. in the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform cdc groups a-3, a-4, and a-5; some strains of b-1 and b-3; "corynebacterium aquaticum"; brevibacterium liquefaciens; rothia dentocariosa; and listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (ca17:0) acids. other species with these types  of cfa included b. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (ca13:0) acids. cfas useful for distinguishing among jonesia denitrificans, oerskovia spp., some strains of cdc groups b-1 and b-3, kurthia spp., and propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (c 16:0) acid,  isopentadecanoic (ci15:0) acid, and ca15:0). the second group (straight-chained type), which included actinomyces pyogenes; arcanobacterium haemolyticum; c. bovis; c. cystitidis; c. diphtheriae; c. flavescens, "c. gentalium"; c. jeikeium; c. kutscheri; c. matruchotii; c .minutissimum; c. mycetoides; c. pilosum; c. pseudodiphtheriticum; "c. pseudogenitalium"; c. pseudotuberculosis; c. renale; cdc groups 1, 2, anf-1, d-2, e, f-1, f-2, g-1, g-2, and i-2; c. striatum; "c. tuberculostearicum"; c. ulcerans; c. vitarumen; c. xerosis; and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (c16:0) and oleic acids (c18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (c18:2), stearic acid (c18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. cfa composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.
