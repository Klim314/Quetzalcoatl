TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
AB  == western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used,  but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
