TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
AB  - Mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. Because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. To investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cDNA of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cBD-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. Their predicted peptides share identical N-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. The two longer isoforms, cBD-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the C terminus. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cBD, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. Canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. canigenitalium (MIC of 200 mug/ml). Antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mM. All three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. In situ hybridization indicated that cBD-1 was expressed primarily in Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. In contrast, cBD-2 was located primarily within Leydig cells. The longest isoform, cBD-3, was detected in Sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. The tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - [Genital infection and infertility].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genital infection is the most important cause of infertility worldwide, affecting not only Fallopian tubes but all anatomic urogenital sites, both male and female. METHODS: We present a randomized,prospective and normalized study about sexually transmitted diseases(STD). We include 487 patients, 376 of whom were infertile and the remaining 111 were not and act as control group. RESULTS: 47.3% of infertile patients showed at least one infection: 10.7% had Chlamydia trachomatis infection, whereas only 0.3% had gonococal infection. We found none syphilis. 12.9% of the patients showed yeast belonging to genus Candida, 5% bacterial vaginosis, 3.8% Escherichia coli and 0.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae. The percentage of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. We detected antibodies against Hepatitis B (any serological marker) in 7.8% of the cases. Chlamydial infection and the presence of U. urealyticum were related with infertility (X 12=6,070, p<0.005 and X12=8,782, p<0.005,respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We think these results conclude that is necessary to perform routine tests to screen for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and for infections caused by micoplasma as well, among infertile patients. These patients must be considered of being at risk of acquiring STD, since the percentage of these diseases is higher than the percentage we found among the control group. It is important to insist on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment as a main goal to decrease the number of tubal occlusion and infertile couples.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as Bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). METHODS: In all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of Bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. The analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). RESULTS: A total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. B. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. As for other bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. The respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. Among mycoplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. The male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. The recovery of B. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. In contrast, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. The recovery percentages of B. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Upper urinary tract stones & Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - Extensive culture of stones and of pre-operative and renal pelvic urine for isolation of bacteria and Ureaplasma urealyticum were performed in 70 patients of nephrolithiasis. Stones were subjected to biochemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Micro-organisms were isolated from 33 (47%) of 70 renal stones. Of the 38 species of micro-organisms isolated, 14 were urea-splitting (U. urealyticum 2; Klebsiella pneumoniae 8; Morganella morganii 1; Acinetobacter spp 3) and 24 were nonurea splitting. U. urealyticum was cultured from the renal stones of two patients. Pelvic urine, unlike voided urine did reflect the bacteriology of the stone. Biochemically, 55 stones (79%) were calcium oxalate phosphate stones, 10 (14%) were calcium oxalate stones and 5 (7%) were uric acid stones. None of the stones were found to be of struvite composition. These data suggest that infection stones are uncommon in this part of the country. Further, infection of renal stones with fastidious organisms like U. urealyticum and multi-drug resistant bacteria necessitate their removal to ensure complete cure.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - In vitro activity of florphenicol.
AB  - Florphenicol was active at a lower concentration than chloramphenicol against over half of 234 recent clinical bacterial isolates. The majority (98%) of the isolates were inhibited by florphenicol at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less. Florphenicol was particularly effective against chloramphenicol resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Klebsiella aerogenes and Bacteroides spp. Florphenicol was bacteristatic for salmonellae and Escherichia coli but bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae. Florphenicol was slightly more active than chloramphenicol against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae but less active against Ureaplasma urealyticum.
TI  - Culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  - To determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. Routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in the last 31 of the patients in this series. Of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with abnormal analyses. Fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for U. urealyticum. In reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution was the same regardless of the presence or absence of U. urealyticum. Antibiotic treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients despite conversion to a negative culture. Cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. There were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. Trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
