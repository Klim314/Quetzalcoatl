TI  == electricity producing property and bacterial community structure in microbial fuel cell equipped with membrane electrode assembly.
AB  == it is important for practical use of microbial fuel cells (mfcs) to not only develop electrodes and proton exchange membranes but also to understand the bacterial community structure related to electricity generation. four lactate fed mfcs equipped with different membrane electrode assemblies (meas) were constructed with paddy field soil as inoculum. the meas significantly affected the electricity-generating properties of the mfcs. mea-i was made with nafion 117 solution and the other meas were made with different configurations of three kinds of polymers. mfc-i equipped with mea-i exhibited the highest performance with a stable current density of 55 +/- 3 ma m(-)(2). mfc-iii equipped with mea-iii with the highest platinum concentration, exhibited the lowest performance with a stable current density of 1.7 +/- 0.1 ma m(-)(2). sem observation revealed that there were cracks on mea-iii. these results demonstrated that it is significantly important to prevent oxygen-intrusion for improved mfc performance. by comparing the data of dgge and phylogenetic analyzes, it was suggested that the dominant bacterial communities of mfc-i were constructed with lactate-fermenters and fe(iii)-reducers, which consisted of bacteria affiliated with the genera of enterobacter, dechlorosoma, pelobacter, desulfovibrio, propioniferax, pelosinus, and firmicutes. a bacterium sharing 100% similarity to  one of the dgge bands was isolated from mfc-i. the 16s rrna gene sequence of the  isolate shared 98% similarity to gram-positive propioniferax sp. p7 and it was confirmed that the isolate produced electricity in an mfc. these results suggested that these bacteria are valuable for constructing the electron transfer network in mfc.

TI  == enriched iron(iii)-reducing bacterial communities are shaped by carbon substrate  and iron oxide mineralogy.
AB  == iron (fe) oxides exist in a spectrum of structures in the environment, with ferrihydrite widely considered the most bioavailable phase. yet, ferrihydrite is  unstable and rapidly transforms to more crystalline fe(iii) oxides (e.g., goethite, hematite), which are poorly reduced by model dissimilatory fe(iii)-reducing microorganisms. this begs the question, what processes and microbial groups are responsible for reduction of crystalline fe(iii) oxides within sedimentary environments? further, how do changes in fe mineralogy shape oxide-hosted microbial populations? to address these questions, we conducted a large-scale cultivation effort using various fe(iii) oxides (ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite) and carbon substrates (glucose, lactate, acetate) along a dilution gradient to enrich for microbial populations capable of reducing fe oxides spanning a wide range of crystallinities and reduction potentials. while carbon source was the most important variable shaping community composition within fe(iii)-reducing enrichments, both fe oxide type and sediment dilution also had a substantial influence. for instance, with acetate as the carbon source, only ferrihydrite enrichments displayed a significant amount of fe(iii) reduction and the well-known dissimilatory metal reducer geobacter sp. was the dominant organism enriched. in contrast, when glucose and lactate were provided,  all three fe oxides were reduced and reduction coincided with the presence of fermentative (e.g., enterobacter spp.) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., desulfovibrio spp.). thus, changes in fe oxide structure and resource availability may shift fe(iii)-reducing communities between dominantly metal-respiring to fermenting and/or sulfate-reducing organisms which are capable of reducing more recalcitrant fe phases. these findings highlight the need for further targeted investigations into the composition and activity of speciation-directed metal-reducing populations within natural environments.
