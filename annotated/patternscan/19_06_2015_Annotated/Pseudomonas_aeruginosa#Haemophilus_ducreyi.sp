TI  == triblock copolymer matrix-based capillary electrophoretic microdevice for high-resolution multiplex pathogen detection.
AB  == rapid and simple analysis for the multiple target pathogens is critical for patient management. ce-sscp analysis on a microchip provides high speed, high sensitivity, and a portable genetic analysis platform in molecular diagnostic fields. the capability of separating ssdna molecules in a capillary electrophoretic microchannel with high resolution is a critical issue to perform  the precise interpretation in the electropherogram. in this study, we explored the potential of poly(ethyleneoxide)-poly(propyleneoxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo-ppo-peo) triblock copolymer as a sieving matrix for ce-sscp analysis on a microdevice. to demonstrate the superior resolving power of peo-ppo-peo copolymers, 255-bp pcr amplicons obtained from 16s ribosomal rna genes of four bacterial species, namely proteus mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis, were analyzed in the peo-ppo-peo matrix in comparison with 5% linear polyacrylamide and commercial genescan gel. due to enhanced dynamic coating and sieving ability, peo-ppo-peo copolymer displayed fourfold enhancement of resolving power in the ce-sscp to separate same-sized dna molecules. fivefold input of genomic dna of p. aeruginosa and/or n. meningitidis  produced proportionally increased corresponding amplicon peaks, enabling correct  quantitative analysis in the pathogen detection. besides the high-resolution sieving capability, a facile loading and replenishment of gel in the microchannel due to thermally reversible gelation property makes peo-ppo-peo triblock copolymer an excellent matrix in the ce-sscp analysis on the microdevice.

TI  == [chronic genital ulcerations and hiv infection: 29 cases].
AB  == genital ulcers are common manifestations of infectious disease. the incidence of  genital ulcers featuring a chronic course has increased since the beginning of the aids epidemic. the purpose of this 18-month cross-sectional study was to determine the main infectious causes of chronic genital ulcers (cgu) and their correlation with hiv infection. a total of 29 patients with cgu defined as an ulcer showing no sign of healing after more than one month were studied. mean age ranged from 24 to 54 years. the male-to-female sex ratio was 1:5. the etiology was herpes in 19 cases (65.5 p. 100), chancroid in 6 cases (20.6 p. 100), streptococcal infection in 2 cases (6.8 p. 100), pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in 1 case (3.4 p. 100) and cutaneous amibiasis in 1 case (3.4 p. 100). twenty-two patients (75.8 p. 100) presented hiv infection including 16 with hiv1 and 6 with  hiv1 and hiv2. all patients with herpes were hiv-positive. eighteen of these patients were in stage c3 of hiv infection. genital herpes was the main etiology  of ugc in patients with hiv infection (p < 0.001). conversely chancroid was the main etiology in patients without hiv infection (p < 0.05). this finding suggests that herpetic cgu is highly suggestive of aids whereas chancroid cgu is not. although syphilis is widespread in africa, it was not a cause of cgu in this study. search for herpes simplex virus or haemophilus ducreyi in patients with cgu is an important criteria for presumptive diagnosis of aids in africa.

TI  == ofloxacin. a reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
AB  == ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. it has good in vitro activity against most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. however, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. the efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated c. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). again, ofloxacin  demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. the availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral  bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. the tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. the most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. it was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and  tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. conclusion: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of c. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated  pid, although its acceptance as monotherapy in pid is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.

TI  == use of pyocin to select a haemophilus ducreyi variant defective in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, a cause of genital ulcer disease in developing countries, appears to facilitate the heterosexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus in africa. despite an increase in studies of this gram-negative human pathogen, little is known about the pathogenesis of chancroid. our studies have shown that the lipooligosaccharides (los) of h. ducreyi may play an important role in ulcer formation. monoclonal antibody and mass spectrometric analyses identified a terminal trisaccharide present on h. ducreyi los that is immunochemically similar to human paragloboside. this epitope is present on the los of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and it may be the site of attachment for pyocin lysis. we have used pyocin, produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, to select los variants with sequential saccharide deletions from n. gonorrhoeae. on the basis of the similarities between n. gonorrhoeae and h. ducreyi los, we employed the same technique to determine if h. ducreyi strains were susceptible to pyocin lysis. in this study, we report the generation of a pyocin n-resistant h. ducreyi strain which synthesizes a truncated version of the parental los. further studies have shown that this h. ducreyi variant has lost the terminal los epitope defined by monoclonal antibody 3f11. this report demonstrates that h. ducreyi is sensitive to pyocins and that this technique can be used to generate h. ducreyi los variants. such variants could be used in comparative studies to relate los structure to biologic function in the pathogenesis of chancroid.

TI  == in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
