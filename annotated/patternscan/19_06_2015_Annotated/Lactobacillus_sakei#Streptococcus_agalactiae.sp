TI  == antibacterial activity of selected standard strains of lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins--pilot study.
AB  == introduction: in this paper, an attempt was made to evaluate the antibacterial potential of standard strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) producing bacteriocins of various classes, thus demonstrating various mechanisms of cell membrane damages against the streptococcus agalactiae strains (group b streptococcus, gbs), depending on surface polysaccharides and surface alpha-like  protein genes. materials/methods: antimicrobial property of the strains of l. plantarum c 11, l. sakei dsmz 6333, and l. lactis atcc 11454 producing bacteriocins: jk and ef plantaricins, sakacin and nisin, respectively, against the gbs strains was evaluated. the chosen to the study gbs strains were represented by serotypes ia, ib, ii, iii, v and they had bca, epsilon, rib, alp2  or alp3 alpha-like protein genes. the experiment was conducted by means of suspension culture and the bacteria count was determined using the serial dilution method. results: a great ability of l. plantarum c 11 strain was proven  to inhibit the gbs growth. the strain of l. sakei dsmz 6333 did not demonstrate any ability to inhibit the growth of gbs, whereas l. lactis atcc 11454 inhibited  the growth of s. agalactiae indicator strains to a minor extent. statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the gbs strains representing various serotypes against the antimicrobial activity of model lab strains. the least sensitive to the activity of bacteriocins were the strains representing serotypes ib and iii, whereas the strains representing serotype ii were the most  sensitive. the sensitivity of the gbs strains to the antimicrobial activity of lab was not dependent on alpha-like protein genes. discussion: among the lab standard strains producing bacteriocins, the strongest antimicrobial property was observed in the strain of l. plantarum c 11. because of the generally known and verified strong antagonistic property of the strains of l. plantarum species against indicator bacteria, it is necessary to further pursue the research presented in this paper.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.
