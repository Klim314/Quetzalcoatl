TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == reutericyclin is a unique antimicrobial tetramic acid produced by some strains of lactobacillus reuteri. this study aimed to identify the genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis. comparisons of the genomes of reutericyclin-producing l. reuteri strains with those of non-reutericyclin-producing strains identified a genomic island of 14 open reading frames (orfs) including genes coding for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps), a polyketide synthase (pks), homologues of phla, phlb, and phlc, and putative transport and regulatory proteins. the protein encoded by rtcn is composed of a condensation domain, an adenylation domain likely specific for d-leucine, and a thiolation domain. rtck codes for a pks that is composed of a ketosynthase domain, an acyl-carrier protein domain, and a thioesterase domain. the products of rtca, rtcb, and rtcc are homologous to the diacetylphloroglucinol-biosynthetic proteins phlabc and may acetylate the tetramic acid moiety produced by rtcn and rtck, forming reutericyclin. deletion of rtcn or rtcabc in l. reuteri tmw1.656 abrogated reutericyclin production but did not affect resistance to reutericyclin. genes coding for transport and regulatory proteins could be deleted only in the reutericyclin-negative l. reuteri strain tmw1.656deltartcn, and these deletions eliminated reutericyclin resistance. the genomic analyses suggest that the reutericyclin genomic island was horizontally acquired from an unknown source during a unique event. the combination of phlabc homologues with both an nrps and a pks has also been identified in the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus plantarum, suggesting that the genes in these organisms and those in l. reuteri share an evolutionary origin.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus reuteri-derived biosurfactant on the gene expression profile of essential adhesion genes (gtfb, gtfc and ftf) of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: streptococci are the main causative agents in plaque formation and mutans streptococci are the principle etiological agent of dental plaque and caries. the process of biofilm formation is a step-wise process, starting with adhesion of planktonic cells to the surfaces. it is now a well known fact that expression of glucosyltransferases (gtfs) and fructosyltransferase (ftf) genes play a critical role in the initial adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the tooth surface, which results in the formation of dental plaques and consequently caries and other periodontal diseases. materials and methods: in the present study, we have determined the effect of biosurfactants purified from lactobacillus reuteri  (dsm20016) culture on gene expression profile of gftb/c and fft of s. mutans (atcc35668) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the  application of biosurfactant caused considerable down-regulation of the expression of all three genes under study. the reduction in gene expression was statistically very significant (p > 0.0001 for all three genes). conclusions: inhibition of these genes by the extracted l. reuteri biosurfactant shows the emergence of a powerful alternative to the presently practicing alternatives. in  view of the importance of these gene products for s. mutans attachment to the tooth surface, which is the initial important step in biofilm production and dental caries, we believe that the biosurfactant prepared in this study could be  considered as a step ahead in dental caries prevention.

TI  == investigation of probiotic bacteria as dental caries and periodontal disease biotherapeutics.
AB  == oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory markers. despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated prevalence rates. recent work has demonstrated that probiotic bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including caries-causing streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. the aim of this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for s. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting characteristics. the probiotic bacteria were screened for s. mutans inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary ph modulation, probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with s. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes, bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity. the results indicate that lactobacillus reuteri strains ncimb 701359, ncimb 701089, ncimb 702655 and ncimb 702656 inhibited s. mutans to non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). l. reuteri strains also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 microm trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal disease therapeutics. although lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221 inhibited s. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the ph (4.18) of saliva containing s. mutans, co-aggregated with s. mutans (10.09%), demonstrated  high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mm) and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11%). this study identified four l. reuteri strains and one l. fermentum strain to be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.

TI  == the growth of streptococcus mutans in different milks for infant feeding.
AB  == after birth various bacterial species, mainly streptococci, colonize the oral cavity and are frequently isolated from carious lesions in children. previous studies suggest that an earlier colonization of a child's mouth by cariogenic organisms might be related to a higher risk of caries. the aim of this study is to assess the influence of different milks for infant feeding on the growth of streptococcus mutans (sm) colonies. three human milk samples from three different mothers and five infant formulas were tested. to prepare the bacterial inoculum,  sm was grown in brain heart infusion broth for 18 hours at 37 degrees c in microaerophilic atmosphere. the growth of sm was determined immediately after the inoculation of milks (t0) and after 24 hours (t24) of incubation. after 24 hours  of incubation (deltat= cfus/ml at t24 cfus/ml at t0) the bacterial growth changes were different among milks. among the complementary milks tested, deltat of formulas supplemented with lactobacillus reuteri and with bifidobacterium lactis  was lower than those of non-supplemented formula. in conclusion, on the basis of  the reduced sm growth in milks supplemented with probiotics, we may speculate that these formulas have a preventive effect on the development of caries in children.

TI  == effectiveness of crt at measuring the salivary level of bacteria in caries prone  children with probiotic therapy.
AB  == aim: this irb approved clinical trial was to determine the effect of "over the counter" probiotic supplements on the caries risk test- crt- (ivoclar) results of the oral microflora in high caries risk children. study design: sixty subjects 6  to 12 years old with a caries risk assessment (cambra) of moderate to high (caries prone) were evaluated by an analysis of the difference in the salivary levels of pathogenic bacteria (mutans streptococci and lactobacilli). the subjects were randomly selected by randomizing software and assigned to two diferent groups. group a used periobalance (lactobacilli reuteri-cfu of 200 million) lozenges for 28 days. group b used the evorakids (streptococcus uberis kj2, streptococcus oralis kj3, streptococcus rattus jh1 45, > or = 100 million) probiotics chewable tablets for 30 days. salivary samples were collected then incubated for 48 hours for colony counting and ranking. follow up testing with the crt was performed after 60 days at a follow up visit. results: there was a statistically significant diference in the crt results between the pre and post use of the probiotics. periobalance; sm results t= -6. 78, p< .0001, lactobacilli results t= -5.762, p< .0001, evorakids smresults t= -7.33, p< .0001, lactobacilli results t= -2.952, p= .0068. conclusions: the crt values obtained with caries prone children may be significantly affected by probiotic use. based on this study's results the following conclusions can be made: both evorakids and periobalance affected the crt results by significantly decreasing the number of s. mutans and lactobacilli present in the salivary samples.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus reuteri during the first year of life reduces caries prevalence in the primary dentition at 9 years of age.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on oral health, at age 9 years,  of daily oral supplementation with the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri, strain atcc 55730, to mothers during the last month of gestation and to children through the first year of life. the study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 113 children: 60 in the probiotic and 53 in the placebo group. the subjects underwent clinical and radiographic examination of the primary dentition and carious lesions, plaque and gingivitis were recorded. saliva and plaque were sampled for determination of mutans streptococci (ms) and  lactobacilli (lb) in saliva and plaque as well as salivary secretory iga (siga).  forty-nine (82%) children in the probiotic group and 31 (58%) in the placebo group were caries-free (p < 0.01). the prevalence of approximal caries lesions was lower in the probiotic group (0.67 +/- 1.61 vs. 1.53 +/- 2.64; p < 0.05) and  there were fewer sites with gingivitis compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05).  there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to frequency of toothbrushing, plaque and dietary habits, but to intake of fluoride  supplements (p < 0.05). there were no intergroup differences with respect to l. reuteri, ms, lb or siga in saliva. within the limitation of this study it seems that daily supplementation with l. reuteri from birth and during the first year of life is associated with reduced caries prevalence and gingivitis score in the  primary dentition at 9 years of age.

TI  == salivary iga response to probiotic bacteria and mutans streptococci after the use of chewing gum containing lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == we investigated whether ingestion of probiotic bacteria could influence salivary  iga levels, specific anti-mutans streptococci iga levels and specific antibodies  towards the ingested probiotic bacterium. the study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, where the test group (n = 11) received twice daily chewing of gum containing lactobacillus reuteri (2 x 10(8) cfu per dose) and the control group (n = 12) received placebo. resting saliva was collected before and after 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks after end of treatment. total salivary iga concentrations were measured by elisa. specific iga reactivity was determined using a whole-cell elisa. results were expressed as % iga per protein in saliva. the level of total iga% per protein increased significantly between pretreatment levels (13.5%) and follow-up treatment levels  (14.4%) within the test group only (p < 0.05). no changes were seen in the control group during the trial. the level of probiotic-reactive antibodies decreased significantly between pre- and post-treatment samples (from 12.2% to 9.0%, p < 0.05) in the test group. similarly, the level of specific mutans streptococci antibodies decreased significantly between pre- and post-treatment samples (p < 0.05) in the test group only (for streptococcus mutans from 20.1% to 15.0%; for streptococcus sobrinus from 7.4% to 5.3%). ingestion of probiotic bacteria might influence the adaptive immune response of the host.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289 and l. paracasei dsmz16671 on the adhesion and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == probiotics have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms) in clinical studies. the aim of this study was to compare the effects of lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289 and l. paracasei dsmz16671 on the adhesion of a reference strain and a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans and on the counts of ms in a biofilm. the adhesion of s. mutans ingbritt and the clinical isolate s. mutans 2366 to a smooth glass surface and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) were studied in the presence of and without the lactobacilli. a three-species biofilm formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs was used in the biofilm experiments. the lactobacilli did not affect adhesion to the glass surface but interfered with binding to sha. no effects of the lactobacilli were detected on the ms levels in the three-species biofilms. the results of the sha binding experiments best reflected the results of the existing clinical studies.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri influences regrowth of mutans streptococci after full-mouth disinfection: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.
AB  == this study assessed whether the persistence of lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289 in saliva could delay the regrowth of mutans streptococci (ms)  after a full-mouth disinfection with chlorhexidine (chx). a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 6-week intervention period and 3- and 6-month follow-up was performed. 62 healthy subjects with moderate to high counts of ms were randomly assigned to a test group (n = 32) or a placebo group (n = 30). before onset of the intervention, subjects received two sessions of professional cleaning, flossing, and application of chx varnish and rinsed their  mouth with a chx solution between the sessions (2 days). thereafter, the test group used probiotic lozenges (2/day) containing l. reuteri (dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289; 1 x 10(8) cfu of each strain), and the placebo group used identical lozenges lacking the lactobacilli. saliva samples were collected and cultured onto selective media, and isolates of l. reuteri as well as dna directly extracted from saliva were tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with specific primers. presence of salivary ms was analysed with a chair-side test. l. reuteri was frequently detected by culture during the intervention period but in  only 3 test group subjects at follow-ups. regrowth of ms statistically significantly differed depending on the presence or absence of l. reuteri dsm 17938 detected by pcr. we conclude that cultivable l. reuteri strains may only sporadically be confirmed after termination of the intervention, but subjects with pcr-detected l. reuteri demonstrated slower regrowth of ms.

TI  == acid production in dental plaque after exposure to probiotic bacteria.
AB  == background: the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli in health maintenance has raised the question of potential risks. one possible side effect  could be an increased acidogenicity in dental plaque. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on plaque lactic acid (la) production in vitro and in vivo. methods: in the first part (a), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (l. reuteri dsm 17938, l. plantarum 299v) were added to  suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). la production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. in the second part (b), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (l. reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. the concentration of  la in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks.  salivary counts of mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli were estimated with  chair-side methods. results: plaque suspensions with l. reuteri dsm 17938 produced significantly less la compared with l. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). fructose gave higher la concentrations than xylitol. in part b, there were no significant differences in la production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed.  the salivary ms counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). conclusion: lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol. the study protocol was approved by the danish national committee on biomedical research ethics (protocol no h-2-2010-112). trial registration: nct01700712.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 differ in their cariogenic properties in vitro.
AB  == objective: the effects of probiotics on cariogenic biofilms remain controversial. our aim was to characterise two probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains, atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 from a cariogenic standpoint in vitro. these strains are used in commercial products designed for oral health purposes. design: the adhesion and biofilm formation were studied on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the effects of glucose or sucrose on the biofilm formation were also tested. arginine metabolism was assessed by measuring the ph in the presence of glucose and arginine. the degradation of hydroxyapatite was measured in three different growth media. streptococcus mutans strains ingbritt and mt 8148 were used as positive controls for bacterial adhesion and degradation of hydroxyapatite. results: strain atcc pta 5289 adhered on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and formed  detectable biofilm, but strain atcc 55730 was poor in both adhesion and biofilm formation. both strains were arginolytic and raised the ph in the presence of arginine. the amount of dissolved calcium from hydroxyapatite correlated with bacterial growth rate and the final ph of the growth medium. conclusion: l. reuteri strains atcc pta 5289 and atcc 55730 differed in their adhesion, biofilm  formation and arginine metabolism in vitro. thus, these probiotic lactobacilli are likely to differ in their behaviour and cariogenic potential also in an oral  environment.

TI  == probiotic supplements (lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289) do not  affect regrowth of mutans streptococci after full-mouth disinfection with chlorhexidine: a randomized controlled multicenter trial.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of tablets containing  two probiotic lactobacillus reuteri strains in inhibiting regrowth of salivary mutans streptococci (ms) after full-mouth disinfection (fmd) with chlorhexidine.  the null hypothesis was that the levels of ms would not differ in comparison with a placebo protocol. the study population was comprised of 62 young adults (mean age 23 years) with moderate or high counts of salivary ms who volunteered after informed consent. the study was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. after a 3-day chlorhexidine regimen, the subjects were randomly assigned to a test group (n = 32) with probiotic lozenges (2/day) or a placebo group (n = 30). the intervention period was 6 weeks, and stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and after 1, 6, and 12 weeks. the samples were processed for ms by a chair-side test and dna-dna hybridization as an estimate of 19 bacterial strains associated with oral health and disease. there was no significant difference between the groups at inclusion, and fmd reduced the salivary ms levels significantly in both groups. the ms suppression lasted less than 6 weeks and there were no statistical differences in salivary ms regrowth between the test and control groups at any of the follow-ups. likewise, there were no major differences in the regrowth patterns of the checkerboard panel between the two groups. we conclude that daily oral administration of l. reuteri  did not seem to affect or delay the regrowth of salivary ms after fmd with chlorhexidine.

TI  == short-term consumption of probiotic lactobacilli has no effect on acid production of supragingival plaque.
AB  == acidogenicity and the levels of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental plaque after the use of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and lactobacillus reuteri were determined. the study had a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. thirteen  volunteers used tablets containing lgg or a combination of l. reuteri sd2112 and  pta 5289 for 2 weeks. at baseline and at the end of each tablet period, all available supragingival plaque was collected. lactic acid production was determined from a fixed volume (8 mul) of fresh plaque and the rest of the plaque was used for culturing ms and lactobacilli. the retention of probiotics to the plaque was assessed using pcr techniques. no probiotic-induced changes were found in the acidogenicity of plaque. also, ms counts remained at the original level. the number of subjects with lactobacilli in plaque increased in the l. reuteri group (p = 0.011) but not in the lgg group. pcr analysis of plaque revealed the presence of lgg in four and l. reuteri in six subjects after the use of the probiotic. the use of the lactobacilli did not affect the acidogenicity or ms levels of plaque. short-term consumption of lgg and l. reuteri appeared not to influence the acidogenicity of plaque.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  == some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. however, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. the ph fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. all strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in ph with sorbitol and two with xylitol. none of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. as all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for  oral health purposes can be made.

TI  == a probiotic lozenge administered medical device and its effect on salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == background: previous studies have suggested that lactobacilli-derived probiotics  in dairy products may affect oral ecology, but the effects of different delivery  methods have received little attention. aim: the aim of the present study was to  investigate the effect of the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri, delivered by a new medical device, on the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in young women with high streptococcus mutans counts. design: this is a randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 20 healthy young women (aged 20  years): 10 as subjects and 10 as controls. the study subjects (group a) sucked the medical device containing the probiotic lozenge with l. reuteri atcc 55730/l. reuteri atcc pta 5289 (1.1 x 10(8) cfu) once daily for 10 days, while the control subjects (group b) received placebo medical devices without bacteria. salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits at baseline and 1 day after the final ingestion. results: salivary s. mutans levels  in the probiotic test group were significantly reduced, with statistical significance of reduction (p < 0.05). conclusions: a short-term daily ingestion of lactobacilli-derived probiotics delivered via medical device containing probiotic lozenge reduced the levels of salivary mutans.

TI  == effect of chewing gums containing xylitol or probiotic bacteria on salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the aim was to evaluate the effect of xylitol and probiotic chewing gums on salivary mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli (lb). the material consisted of 80 healthy young adults (21-24 years) who volunteered after informed consent.  they were assigned by random into one of four parallel study groups: a, probiotic gum group; b, xylitol gum group; c, probiotic + xylitol gum group; and d, placebo gum group. the gums were taken three times daily after meals, and the intervention period was 3 weeks. the probiotic gums contained two strains of lactobacilli reuteri (atcc 55730 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu/gum and atcc pta 5289 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) cfu/gum), and each pellet of the xylitol gum contained approximately 1.0 g xylitol as single sweetener. pretreatment and posttreatment samples of stimulated whole saliva were collected and quantified for ms and lb with chair-side kits. a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) of salivary ms was displayed in group a and b after the intervention when compared with baseline. a similar but nonsignificant tendency was seen in group c. no alterations of salivary lb was demonstrated in any group. in conclusion, daily chewing on gums containing probiotic bacteria or xylitol reduced the levels of salivary ms in a significant way. however, a combination of probiotic and xylitol gums did not seem to enhance this effect.

TI  == salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli levels after ingestion of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 by straws or tablets.
AB  == objective: previous studies have suggested that lactobacilli-derived probiotics in dairy products may affect oral ecology, but the impact of different vehicles of ingestion has received little attention. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 on the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in young adults when ingested by two different delivery systems. material and methods: the material comprised 120 healthy young adults (21-24 years) and a placebo-controlled study design with parallel arms was utilized. the subjects were randomly assigned to four equally sized groups: group a drank 200 ml of water through a prepared straw containing l. reuteri atcc 55730 once daily for 3  weeks, while group b took 200 ml water through a placebo straw during the same period. group c was given one tablet containing l. reuteri atcc 55730 once daily  for 3 weeks, while group d received placebo tablets without bacteria. salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits at baseline and 1 day after the final ingestion. results: a statistically significant reduction of the mutans streptococci levels was recorded after ingestion of the probiotic bacteria via the straw (p<0.05) and the tablets (p<0.01), which was in contrast to the placebo controls. a similar but non-significant trend was seen for lactobacilli. conclusions: a short-term daily  ingestion of lactobacilli-derived probiotics delivered by prepared straws or lozenges reduced the levels of salivary mutans streptococci in young adults.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri in bovine milk fermented decreases the oral carriage of mutans streptococci.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus reuteri against one of the major cariogenic organism, streptococcus mutans, was studied. yogurt products containing l.reuteri showed a  significant growth inhibitory effect against s. mutans, whilst yoghurts with lactobaccilli other than l. reuteri did not show such inhibition. further, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that consuming yogurt with l. reuteri significantly reduced the oral carriage of mutans streptococci, compared  with the placebo yogurt.

TI  == characterization of a novel fructosyltransferase from lactobacillus reuteri that  synthesizes high-molecular-weight inulin and inulin oligosaccharides.
AB  == fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes produce fructose polymers (fructans) from sucrose. here, we report the isolation and characterization of an ftf-encoding gene from lactobacillus reuteri strain 121. a c-terminally truncated version of the ftf gene was successfully expressed in escherichia coli. when incubated with  sucrose, the purified recombinant ftf enzyme produced large amounts of fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) with beta-(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units, plus a high-molecular-weight fructan polymer (>10(7)) with beta-(2-->1) linkages (an inulin). fos, but not inulin, was found in supernatants of l. reuteri strain 121  cultures grown on medium containing sucrose. bacterial inulin production has been reported for only streptococcus mutans strains. fos production has been reported  for a few bacterial strains. this paper reports the first-time isolation and molecular characterization of (i) a lactobacillus ftf gene, (ii) an inulosucrase  associated with a generally regarded as safe bacterium, (iii) an ftf enzyme synthesizing both a high molecular weight inulin and fos, and (iv) an ftf protein containing a cell wall-anchoring lpxtg motif. the biological relevance and potential health benefits of an inulosucrase associated with an l. reuteri strain remain to be established.
