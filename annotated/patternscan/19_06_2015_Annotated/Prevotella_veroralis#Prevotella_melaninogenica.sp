TI  == prevotella histicola sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus prevotella, being most closely related to prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis. a novel species, prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid  as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 43 mol%. the type strain of prevotella histicola is t05-04t (=dsm 19854t=ccug 55407t).

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == prevotella paludivivens sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, hemicellulose-decomposing bacterium isolated from plant residue and rice roots in irrigated rice-field soil.
AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains, kb7(t) and a42, were isolated from rice plant residue and living rice roots, respectively, from irrigated rice-field soil in japan. these two strains were closely related to each other with 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 99.8 %. both strains showed almost the same physiological  properties. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods. growth  was remarkably stimulated by the addition of haemin to the medium. the strains utilized various saccharides including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose and produced acetate and succinate with small amounts of formate and malate. the strains grew at 10-40 degrees c; optimum growth was observed at 30 degrees c and ph 5.7-6.7. oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were not detected. aesculin was hydrolysed. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(15 : 0), c(15 : 0) and iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. menaquinones mk-11 and mk-11(h(2)) were the major respiratory quinones and the genomic dna g+c content was 39.2 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences placed both strains in the phylum bacteroidetes. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the most related species to both strains was prevotella oulorum (92.8-92.9 % similarity). prevotella veroralis and prevotella  melaninogenica were the next most closely related known species with sequence similarities of 91.9-92.4 %. based on differences in the phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics between the two isolates and related species, it is proposed that strains kb7(t) and a42 represent a novel species, prevotella paludivivens sp. nov. this is the first described prevotella species derived from a natural habitat; all other prevotella species are from mammalian sources. the type strain of prevotella paludivivens is kb7(t) (=jcm 13650(t)=dsm 17968(t)).

TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

TI  == a hemagglutinating variant of prevotella melaninogenica isolated from the oral cavity.
AB  == strains resembling prevotella melaninogenica were isolated from healthy subjects  and patients with periodontal disease and were identified using: a 5-test phenotypic screen; commercial identification kits; and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. eleven clinical isolates closely resembling p. melaninogenica, and all from patients with periodontitis, were able to agglutinate erythrocytes. in the electron microscope, hemagglutinating isolates showed fimbria-like structures, that were not seen on non-hemagglutinating isolates. some strains were further classified with pcr-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (rflp) of 16s rrna genes. amplified  16s rdna was digested using five different endonucleases, separated with agarose  gel electrophoresis, stained and photographed. photographs were then scanned, digitized and a distance matrix calculated using dice coefficient, where the presence or absence of a band was used as a character. the distance matrix was plotted as a phenogram. at 70% similarity six clusters were seen. type strains of separate prevotella species did not fall into any cluster. hemagglutinating isolates fell into three clusters: four clustered with the type strains of p. melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis; four with other p. melaninogenica isolates and two hemagglutinating isolates clustered together prevotella loescheii. the pcr-rflp results showed that the hemagglutinating strains did not  form a homogenous group inside the prevotella genus.

TI  == the tet(q) gene in bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontal disease.
AB  == twenty-two tetracycline-resistant (tetr) anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal pockets of 12 patients with refractory periodontitis were examined for the presence of the tet q determinant by dna-dna  hybridization. dot blots of bacterial dna were tested with an intragenic digoxigenin-labelled tet(q) probe consisting of a 1.45 kb ecori/pvuii fragment from plasmid pnfd13-2. southern blots of chromosomal dna digested with the restriction enzyme ecori were also examined. the tet(q) probe hybridized with dna from 8 of the 22 tetr strains, including 2 prevotella intermedia strains and one  strain each of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis  and prevotella melaninogenica. the tetr strains of mitsuokella dentalis and capnocytophaga ochracea also hybridized with the probe. the lack of discernible plasmid dna in all the probe-positive isolates suggests that these tetracycline-resistance genes were chromosomally encoded. the probe hybridized with a different size fragment in all the isolates. this study extends the number of species that carry the tet(q) gene to include several outside the genera prevotella and bacteroides.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == emended descriptions of prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis, and prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  == during studies of human periodontal disease, a number of bacterial strains were encountered that, on the basis of results of standard biochemical tests, appeared to be prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, or prevotella loescheii. however, use of the standard biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid analyses, and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins resulted in conflicting identifications of these strains. the results of tests for cellobiose fermentation, inulin fermentation, and pigment production were responsible for most of the discordant results. cellular fatty acid analyses in which the microbial identification system was used did not differentiate these strains from validly described species, even though separate  library entries were created for them. dna reassociation determinations in which  the s1 nuclease procedure was used showed that cellobiose fermentation and pigment production are variable among strains of p. melaninogenica and p. denticola and that fermentation of xylan is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating p. buccalis from prevotella veroralis. in contrast to previous indications, most strains of p. veroralis do not ferment xylan. these species can be differentiated by dna-dna reassociation and by cellular fatty acid analysis, using the microbial identification system, but differentiation by currently described phenotypic characteristics is not reliable. similarly, p. loescheii and the genetically distinct (but closely related) d1c-20 group cannot be distinguished reliably from each other or from p. veroralis, p. denticola, and p. melaninogenica on the basis of currently described phenotypic tests other than cellular fatty acid composition or, for some species, electrophoretic patterns of soluble whole-cell proteins.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
