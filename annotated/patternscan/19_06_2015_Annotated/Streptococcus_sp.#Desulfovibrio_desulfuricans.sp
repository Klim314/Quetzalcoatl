TI  == anaerobic bioremediation of rdx by ovine whole rumen fluid and pure culture isolates.
AB  == the ability of ruminal microbes to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) in ovine whole rumen fluid (wrf) and as 24 bacterial isolates was examined under anaerobic conditions. compound degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites. organisms in wrf microcosms degraded 180 mum rdx within 4 h. nitroso-intermediates hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (mnx), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (dnx), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (tnx) were present as early as 0.25 h and were detected throughout the 24-h incubation period, representing one reductive pathway of ring cleavage. following reduction to mnx, peaks consistent  with m/z 193 and 174 were also produced, which were unstable and resulted in rapid ring cleavage to a common metabolite consistent with an m/z of 149. these represent two additional reductive pathways for rdx degradation in ovine wrf, which have not been previously reported. the 24 ruminal isolates degraded rdx with varying efficiencies (0-96 %) over 120 h. of the most efficient degraders identified, clostridium polysaccharolyticum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans degraded rdx when medium was supplemented with both nitrogen and carbon, while anaerovibrio lipolyticus, prevotella ruminicola, and streptococcus bovis ifo utilized rdx as a sole source of nitrogen. this study showed that organisms in whole rumen fluid, as well as several ruminal isolates,  have the ability to degrade rdx in vitro and, for the first time, delineated the  metabolic pathway for its biodegradation.

TI  == strategy for microbiome analysis using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis on the illumina sequencing platform.
AB  == understanding the identity and changes of organisms in the urogenital and other microbiomes of the human body may be key to discovering causes and new treatments of many ailments, such as vaginosis. high-throughput sequencing technologies have recently enabled discovery of the great diversity of the human microbiome. the cost per base of many of these sequencing platforms remains high (thousands of dollars per sample); however, the illumina genome analyzer (iga) is estimated to  have a cost per base less than one-fifth of its nearest competitor. the main disadvantage of the iga for sequencing pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes is that the maximum read-length of the iga is only 100 bases; whereas, at least 300 bases are needed to obtain phylogenetically informative data down to the genus and species  level. in this paper we describe and conduct a pilot test of a multiplex sequencing strategy suitable for achieving total reads of > 300 bases per extracted dna molecule on the iga. results show that all proposed primers produce products of the expected size and that correct sequences can be obtained, with all proposed forward primers. various bioinformatic optimization of the illumina  bustard analysis pipeline proved necessary to extract the correct sequence from iga image data, and these modifications of the data files indicate that further optimization of the analysis pipeline may improve the quality rankings of the data and enable more sequence to be correctly analyzed. the successful application of this method could result in an unprecedentedly deep description (800,000 taxonomic identifications per sample) of the urogenital and other microbiomes in a large number of samples at a reasonable cost per sample.

TI  == association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == aim: to investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (ibs) and the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota composition. methods: fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with  ibs. their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for ibs patients. thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the gi microbiota composition. eubacteria and gi bacterial genera (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and veillonella), groups (clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale, desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16s rdna  sequence resemblance to species bifidobacterium catenulatum, clostridium cocleatum, collinsella aerofaciens (c. aerofaciens), coprococcus eutactus (c. eutactus), ruminococcus torques and streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with ibs were quantified. correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various ibs-related symptoms were investigated. results: associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain gi bacteria. a ruminococcus torques (r. torques)-like (94% similarity in  16s rrna gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. furthermore, among ibs subjects with r. torques 94% detected, the amounts of c. cocleatum 88%, c. aerofaciens-like and c. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on gi microbiota with regard to c. aerofaciens-like  phylotype, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. conclusion: bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of ibs, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.
