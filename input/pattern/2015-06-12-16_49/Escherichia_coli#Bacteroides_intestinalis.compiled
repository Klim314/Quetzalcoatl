TI  - Conversion of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into their 7-oxo derivatives  by Bacteroides intestinalis AM-1 isolated from human feces.
AB  - Secondary bile acid-producing bacteria were isolated from human feces to improve  our appreciation of the functional diversity and redundancy of the intestinal microbiota. In total, 619 bacterial colonies were isolated using a nutrient-poor agar medium and the level of secondary bile acid formation was examined in each by a liquid culture, followed by thin-layer chromatography. Of five strains analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical testing, one was identified as Bacteroides intestinalis AM-1, which was not previously recognized as a secondary bile-acid producer. GC-MS revealed that B. intestinalis AM-1 converts cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid into their 7-oxo derivatives, 7-oxo-deoxycholic acid (7-oxo-DCA) and 7-oxo-lithocholic acid, respectively. Thus, B. intestinalis AM-1 possesses 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7alpha-HSDH) activity. In liquid culture, B. intestinalis AM-1 showed a relatively higher productivity of 7-oxo-DCA than Escherichia coli HB101 and Bacteroides fragilis JCM11019(T), which are known to possess 7alpha-HSDH activity. The level of 7alpha-HSDH activity was higher in B. intestinalis AM-1 than in the other two strains under the conditions tested. The 7alpha-HSDH activity in each of the three strains is not induced by CA; instead, it is regulated in a growth phase-dependent manner.
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
