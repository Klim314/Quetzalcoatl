TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
