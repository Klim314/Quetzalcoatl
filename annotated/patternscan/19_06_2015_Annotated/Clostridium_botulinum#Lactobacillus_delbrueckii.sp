TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
