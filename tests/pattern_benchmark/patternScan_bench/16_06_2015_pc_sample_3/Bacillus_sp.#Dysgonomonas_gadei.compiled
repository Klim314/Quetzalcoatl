TI  - Dysgonomonas hofstadii sp. nov., isolated from a human clinical source.
AB  - A Gram-negative staining, facultative anaerobic, cocco-bacillus-shaped organism was isolated from a post-operative abdominal wound. Based on morphological and biochemical criteria, strain MX 1040 (=CCUG 54731(T)) was tentatively identified as Bacteroidaceae but did not correspond to any recognized species of this family. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis demonstrated the organism to be related to species of the genus Dysgonomonas, although sequence divergence values of >5% with the other members of this genus demonstrated the organism to represent a novel species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the novel organism to be most closely related to Dysgonomonas gadei. The major long-chain cellular fatty acids of the novel species consisted of iso-C(14:0), anteiso-C(15:0), C(16:0), and iso-C(16:0). Based on the phenotypic criteria and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that strain MX 1040 from a human clinical source represents a new species of the genus Dysgonomonas, as Dysgonomonas hofstadii sp. nov. The type strain of D. hofstadii is CCUG 54731(T) (=CCM 7606(T)).
