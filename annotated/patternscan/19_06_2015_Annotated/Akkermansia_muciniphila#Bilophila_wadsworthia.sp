TI  == specific gut microbiota features and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with obesity.
AB  == background: gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. the objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake. methods: faecal dna from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment. results: one hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (p<0.001) including akkermansia muciniphila, bilophila wadsworthia, bifidobacterium longum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including bacteroides faecis and dorea longicatena. the majority of the identified correlations between bacterial  species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body  fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for b. longum and f. prausnitzii appeared to be  modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively. conclusions: this  study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. the study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.

TI  == the gut microbiota and the metabolic health of the host.
AB  == purpose of review: it is clear that the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota significantly impact upon human health and disease. recent findings: recent analyses have correlated alterations in microbial community structure with the onset of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease as well as inflammatory conditions of the intestine. this work has demonstrated the influence of diet upon the microbiota in disease states and has identified a number of microbial metabolites that orchestrate the crucial aspects of the host-microbe dialog. the  microbial production of short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine, acetaldehyde and inflammatory mediators has been shown to significantly impact upon the metabolic  health of the host through pathways that influence satiety, gut permeability and  immune function. in the small intestine, microbial metabolism alters the host bile acid profile affecting the interactions with dedicated bile acid receptors (including fxr and tgr5) to influence both local and systemic cellular responses. recent findings have, therefore, identified specific microbiota profiles and metabolites as predictors of disease risk as well as determining the microbial species (such as akkermansia muciniphila and bilophila wadsworthia) which correlate with health and disease. summary: this work identifies the microbiota as an important target for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in metabolic disease.
