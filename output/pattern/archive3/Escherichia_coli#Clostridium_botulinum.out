inhibitions of the translocation pore of clostridium botulinum c2 toxin by tailored azolopyridinium salts protects human cells from intoxication.
c2 toxin from clostridium botulinum represents the prototype of clostridial binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins which destroy the actin-cytoskeleton of mammalian cells and cause severe enteric diseases in humans and animals. after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the c2 toxin complex, the binding/translocation component c2iia forms a heptameric transmembrane pore in membranes of acidified endosomal vesicles. the separate adp-ribosyltransferase component c2i translocates through this c2iia-pore from the endosomal lumen into the cytosol. here we demonstrate that positively charged heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts which were developed as pore blockers for the anthrax toxins, efficiently protect cultured mammalian cells from intoxication with c2 toxin. the inhibitors had no effects on enzyme activity of c2i or receptor binding of c2 toxin but inhibited the ph-dependent membrane translocation of c2i in living cells, most likely by blocking the c2iia-translocation pores. in vitro, the substances blocked c2iia-pores in black lipid bilayer membranes when applied to the cis-side of the membrane which corresponds to the endosomal lumen of cells. thus, heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts could represent lead compounds for development of novel therapeutics against binary clostridial toxins.
cbra is a flavin adenine dinucleotide protein that modifies the escherichia coli  outer membrane and confers specific resistance to colicin m.
colicin m (cma) is a protein toxin produced by escherichia coli that kills sensitive e. coli cells by inhibiting murein biosynthesis in the periplasm. recombinant plasmids carrying cbra (formerly yids) strongly increased resistance of cells to cma, whereas deletion of cbra increased cma sensitivity. transcription of cbra is positively controlled by the two-component crebc system. a deltacreb mutant was highly cma sensitive because little cbra was synthesized. treatment of cbra-overproducing cells by osmotic shock failed to render cells cma sensitive because the cells were resistant to osmotic shock. in a natural environment with a growth-limiting nutrient supply, cells producing cbra defend themselves against colicin m synthesized by competing cells. isolated cbra is a protein with noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. sequence comparison and structure prediction assign the closest relative of cbra with a known crystal structure as digeranylgeranyl-glycerophospholipid reductase of thermoplasma acidophilum. cbra is found in escherichia coli, citrobacter, and salmonella bongori but not in other enterobacteria. the next homologs with the highest identity (over 50%) are found in the anaerobic clostridium botulinum group 1 and a few other firmicutes.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 and clostridium sporogenes in spinach packaged in modified atmospheres after treatment combined with chlorine and lactic acid bacteria.
implementation of modified atmospheric packaging (map) into retail produce is a less commonly practiced method due to differences among commodities and the potential growth of anaerobes. pathogens including escherichia coli o157:h7 have been responsible for spinach outbreaks across the united states. in this study, hurdles, including those currently used with produce safety, such as map and chlorine, were combined with lactic acid bacteria (lab) to inhibit pathogens. spinach was coinoculated with e. coli o157:h7 and clostridium sporogenes, a surrogate for c. botulinum, and treated with water or a hurdle that included water, chlorine, and lab. spinach from treatments were packaged in air (traditional), oxygen (80% o(2), 20% co(2)), or nitrogen (80% n(2), 20% co(2)) and stored in a retail display case for 9 d at 4 to 7 degrees c. the hurdle inhibited e. coli o157:h7 and c. sporogenes compared to controls with reductions of 1.43 and 1.10 log (p < 0.05), respectively. the nitrogen atmosphere was outperformed by air and oxygen in the reduction of e. coli o157:h7 (p < 0.05) with a decrease of 0.26 and 0.15 logs. there were no significant differences among the 3 atmospheres on c. sporogenes survival. relative to these hurdles, we also chose to evaluate the potential benefits of lab in pathogen control. the survival of lab in interventions demonstrates implementation of lab into produce could control pathogens, without damaging produce or altering organoleptic properties. practical application: the goal of our work was to identify methods that could reduce food-borne pathogens in packaged spinach products. using current industry techniques in combination with unique methods, such as the use of beneficial bacteria, our research identified whether harmful microorganisms could be eliminated. our data demonstrate that specific packaging conditions with beneficial bacteria can help eliminate or reduce the survival of e. coli o157:h7 and c. sporogenes (a model for c. botulinum) in produce.
partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
rhoa gtpase and f-actin dynamically regulate the permeability of cx43-made channels in rat cardiac myocytes.
gap junctions are clusters of transmembrane channels allowing a passive diffusion of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. connexin43, the main channel-forming protein expressed in ventricular myocytes, can associate with zonula occludens-1, a scaffolding protein linked to the actin cytoskeleton and to signal transduction molecules. the possible influence of rho gtpases, major regulators of cellular junctions and of the actin cytoskeleton, in the modulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (gjic) was examined. the activation of rhoa by cytoxic necrotizing factor 1 markedly enhanced gjic, whereas its specific inhibition by the clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme significantly reduced it. rhoa activity affects gjic without major cellular redistribution of junctional plaques or changes in the cx43 phosphorylation pattern. as these gtpases frequently act via the cortical cytoskeleton, the importance of f-actin in the modulation of gjic was investigated by means of agents interfering with actin polymerization. cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin slowed down the kinetics of channel rundown in the absence of atp, whereas its disruption by cytochalasin d rapidly and markedly reduced gjic despite atp presence. cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin markedly reduced the consequences of rhoa activation or inactivation. this mechanism appears to be the first described capable to both up- or down-regulate gjic through rhoa activation or, conversely, inhibition. the inhibition of rho downstream kinase effectors had no effect on gjic. the present results provide further insight into the gating and regulation of junctional channels and identify a new downstream target for the small g-protein rhoa.
[evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and aspergillus niger. evaluation of its microbiological charge].
the evaluation of the microbiological charge present in costa rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. the microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in costa rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of clostridium botulinum. for the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in muller hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger. the results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) cfu/g. no positive result was obtained for the isolation of c. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of s. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, a. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
purification and characterization of brochocin a and brochocin b(10-43), a functional fragment generated by heterologous expression in carnobacterium piscicola.
brochothrix campestris atcc 43754 produces a heat-stable, two-component, nonlantibiotic, class iib bacteriocin, brochocin c (brcc), that is active against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including spores of clostridium botulinum. an improved purification method was developed for brcc, in which n-butanol and chloroform extraction are used. mass spectral characterization of the two components, brochocin a (brca) and brochocin b (brcb), showed that both components are excreted into the medium by b. campestris as mature peptides consisting of 59 and 43 amino acids, respectively. separate expression clones of brca and brcb were constructed previously in carnobacterium piscicola lv17c, but the products were not chemically characterized. purification by the new protocol showed that brca is expressed as the mature 59-amino-acid peptide but that brcb is produced by c. piscicola as a fragment, brcb(10-43), which is cleaved at an internal gly-gly site. this fragment is not antimicrobial by itself, but in combination with brca it displays the full activity of the brcc complex. circular dichroism measurements revealed a high beta-sheet content in the secondary structure of both brca and brcb(10-43), as well as in a 1:1 brca-brcb(10-43) mixture. separate expression clones of brca and brcb were also constructed in escherichia coli, but these clones only produced multiple fragments of the desired peptides with little or no activity.
antimicrobial activity of foodborne paenibacillus and bacillus spp. against clostridium botulinum.
the saprophytic paenibacillus and bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. culture supernatants of 200 strains of paenibacillus and bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against c. botulinum type a, proteolytic type b, and type e strains in a well diffusion assay. nineteen strains were positive against c. botulinum. among those, seven paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against c. botulinum strains. the antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive p. polymyxa strains. the antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees c and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees c in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. in co-cultures with the positive strain of p. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a c. botulinum type e strain was inhibited whenever p. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before c. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. the antimicrobial activity of p. polymyxa against c. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors attenuate vascular smooth muscle proliferation by preventing rho gtpase-induced down-regulation of p27(kip1).
the mechanism by which platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (smc) dna synthesis is unknown, but may involve isoprenoid intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (sim, 1-10 microm), inhibited pdgf-induced smc dna synthesis by >95%, retinoblastoma gene product hyperphosphorylation by 90%, and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)-2, -4, and -6 activity by 80 +/- 5, 50 +/- 3, and 48 +/- 3%, respectively. this correlated with a 20-fold increase in p27(kip1) without changes in p16, p21(waf1), or p53 levels compared with pdgf alone. since ras and rho require isoprenoid modification for membrane localization and are implicated in cell cycle regulation, we investigated the effects of sim on ras and rho. up-regulation of p27(kip1) and inhibition of rho but not ras membrane translocation by sim were reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate. indeed, inhibition of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 transferase or overexpression of dominant-negative n19rhoa mutant increased p27(kip1) and inhibited retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation. in contrast, activation of rho by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 decreased p27(kip1) and increased smc dna synthesis. these findings indicate that the down-regulation of p27(kip1) by rho gtpase mediates pdgf-induced smc dna synthesis and suggest a novel direct effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors on the vascular wall.
post-transcriptional regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mrna stability by rho gtpase.
the mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (hmg)-coa reductase inhibitors  increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) expression is unknown. to determine whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affects enos expression, human endothelial cells were treated with the hmg-coa reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (1-10 microm), in the presence of l-mevalonate (200 microm), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (ggpp, 1-10 microm), farnesylpyrophosphate (fpp, 5-10 microm), or low density lipoprotein (ldl, 1 mg/ml). mevastatin increased enos mrna and protein levels by 305 +/- 15% and 180 +/- 11%, respectively. co-treatment with l-mevalonate or ggpp, but not fpp or ldl, reversed mevastatin's effects. because rho gtpases undergo geranylgeranyl modification, we investigated whether rho regulates enos expression. immunoblot analyses and [35s]gtpgammas-binding assays revealed that mevastatin inhibited rho membrane translocation and gtp binding activity by 60 +/- 5% and 78 +/- 6%, both of which were reversed by co-treatment with ggpp but not fpp. furthermore, inhibition of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 transferase (50 microg/ml) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative n19rhoa mutant increased enos expression. in contrast, activation of rho by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (200 ng/ml) decreased enos expression. these findings indicate that rho negatively regulates enos expression and that hmg-coa reductase inhibitors up-regulate enos expression by blocking rho geranylgeranylation, which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity.
inhibition of rho is required for camp-induced melanoma cell differentiation.
up-regulation of the camp pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. since rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding protein in camp-induced dendrite formation. clostridium botulinum c3 exotransferase, which inhibits rho, mimicked the effect of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (cnf-1), which activates rho and the expression of a constitutively active rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. in addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the rho target p160 rho-kinase (p160(rock)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of camp. our results suggest that inhibition of rho and of its target p160(rock) are required events for camp-induced dendrite outgrowth in b16 cells. furthermore, we present evidence that rho is involved in the regulation of melanogenesis. indeed, rho inactivation enhanced the camp stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while rho constitutive activation impaired these camp-induced effects. this reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by camp.
role of rho protein in lovastatin-induced breakdown of actin cytoskeleton.
the rho gtpases are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. they need polyisoprenylation for membrane association and activation. lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a inhibitor, prevents isoprene synthesis and thereby lipid modification of the rho protein carboxy terminus. because lovastatin causes rounding up of cultured cells, we investigated whether the compound acts on the actin cytoskeleton through rho proteins. lovastatin treatment decreased f-actin content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. g-actin content remained unchanged. in lovastatin-treated nih 3t3 cells, the amount of rho protein which was adp-ribosylated by clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 decreased in membranes and increased in the cytosol fraction. cycloheximide prevented lovastatin-induced rounding up of cells. however, after microinjection or direct application of exoenzyme c3, cells treated with cycloheximide and lovastatin rounded up again. on the contrary, lovastatin-treated, round swiss 3t3 cells reverted to a flat morphology when microinjected with dominant active rhoa (val14rhoa). escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1) which activates rho proteins caused flattening of round, lovastatin-treated nih 3t3 cells. these results suggest that lovastatin affects the actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of rho proteins.
