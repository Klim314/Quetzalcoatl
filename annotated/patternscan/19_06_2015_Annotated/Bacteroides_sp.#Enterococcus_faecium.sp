TI  == rapid qpcr-based assay for fecal bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  == concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (fib; e.g. escherichia coli, and enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of  fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human  from non-human fecal contamination. several bacteroides spp. have been suggested  as potential alternative indicators. we have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal bacteroides spp. using quantitative pcr (qpcr) targeting the 16s rrna gene. the assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human bacteroides spp. the details of the  method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. specificity and performance of the qpcr assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. concentrations of fecal bacteroides spp., total enterococcus sp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using qpcr, and total enterococcus sp. and e. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (mf). samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total enterococcus sp., e. coli, e. faecalis, and e. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are  prominent in animal feces. on the other hand, fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in  samples spiked with gull guano. sensitivity and specificity results suggest that  the rapid fecal bacteroides spp. qpcr assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
