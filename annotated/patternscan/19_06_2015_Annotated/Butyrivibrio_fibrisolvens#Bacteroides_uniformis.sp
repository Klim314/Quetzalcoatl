TI  == physiology and genetics of xylan degradation by gastrointestinal tract bacteria.
AB  == hemicelluloses or xylans are major components (35%) of plant materials. for ruminant animals, about 50% of the dietary xylans are degraded, but only small amounts of xylans are degraded in the lower gut of nonruminant animals and humans. in the rumen, the major xylanolytic species are butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and bacteroides ruminicola. in the human colon, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides fragilis subspecies "a" are major xylanolytic bacteria. xylans are chemically complex, and their degradation requires multiple enzymes. expression of these enzymes by gut bacteria varies greatly among species. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens makes extracellular xylanases but bacteroides species have cell-bound xylanase activity. biochemical characterization of xylanolytic enzymes from gut bacteria has not been done. a xylosidase gene has been cloned from b. fibrosolvens 113. the data from dna hybridizations using a xylanase gene cloned from b. fibrisolvens 49 indicate this gene may be present in other b. fibrisolvens strains. a cloned xylanase from bact. ruminicola was transferred to  and highly expressed in bact. fragilis and bact. uniformis. arabinosidase and xylosidase genes from bact. ovatus have been cloned and both activities appear to be catalyzed by a single, bifunctional, novel enzyme. continued research in genetic and biochemical areas will provide knowledge and insights for manipulation of digestion at the gut level and improved understanding of colonic  fiber digestion.

TI  == characterization of the cecal bacteria of normal pigs.
AB  == one hundred ninety-two isolates from cecal contents of three normal weaned pigs were obtained by means of anaerobic roll tube methods and were characterized. seventy-eight percent of the isolates were gram-negative. the most numerous species isolated from each of the pigs was bacteroides ruminicola. this species accounted for 35% of the isolates that were characterized, and selenomonas ruminantium accounted for 21% of the isolates. other gram-negative bacteria isolated from all three pigs were butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (6.0%) and bacteroides uniformis (3.0%); predominant gram-positive isolates were lactobacillus acidophilus (7.6%), peptostreptococcus productus (3.0%), and eubacterium aerofaciens (2.5%). the other 42 isolates were placed in 14 other species, and 5 additional isolates that did not fit well into existing species were not placed taxonomically. fifteen of the isolates (representing nine species) produced urease.
