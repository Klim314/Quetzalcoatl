TI  - Effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on ruminal pH, volatile fatty acids and bacterial flora of Holstein calves.
AB  - Twelve ruminally cannulated Holstein calves (age, 12 +/- 3 weeks) were used to identify the effect of a probiotic comprised of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum on ruminal components. The calves were adapted to a diet containing a 50% high-concentrate (standard diet) for 1 week, and then, the probiotic was given once daily for 5 days (day 1-5) at 1.5 or 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to groups of four calves each. Four additional calves fed the standard diet without probiotic served as the corresponding control. Ruminal pH was measured continuously throughout the 15-day experimental period. Ruminal fluid was collected via a fistula at a defined time predose and on days 7 and 14 to assess volatile fatty acid (VFA), lactic acid and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations, as well as the bacterial community. The probiotic at either dose improved the reduced 24-hr mean ruminal pH in calves. The circadian patterns of the 1 hr mean ruminal pH were identical between the probiotic doses. In both probiotic groups, ruminal lactic acid concentrations remained significantly lower than that of the control. Probiotic did not affect ruminal VFA concentrations. L. plantarum and C. butyricum were not detected in the rumen of calves given the high-dose probiotic, whereas Enterococcus spp. remained unchanged. These results suggest that calves given a probiotic had stable ruminal pH levels (6.6-6.8), presumably due to the effects of the probiotic on stabilizing rumen-predominant bacteria, which consume greater lactate in the rumen.
TI  - Immune-stimulatory effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on peripheral leukocyte  subpopulations and cytokine mRNA expression levels in scouring holstein calves.
AB  - Subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes and cytokine mRNA expression levels were  evaluated in scouring and healthy Holstein calves (age 10 +/- 5 days; n=42) treated with a probiotic consisting of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum. The calves were assigned to the scouring or healthy group and then subdivided into pathogen-positive treated (n=8), pathogen-positive control (n=8), pathogen-negative treated (n=6), pathogen-negative control (n=6), healthy treated (n=6) and healthy control (n=8) groups. A single dose of the probiotic (3.0 g/100 kg body weight) was given to each calf in the treatment groups for 5 days. Blood samples were collected on the first day of scour occurrence (day 0) and on day 7. In the scouring calves, smaller peripheral leukocyte subpopulations and cytokine mRNA expression levels were noted on day 0. The numbers of CD3(+) T cells; CD4(+), CD8(+) and WC1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets; and CD14(+), CD21(+) and CD282(+) (TLR2) cells were significantly increased in the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. Furthermore, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma mRNA expression was elevated in the peripheral leukocytes of the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. The scouring calves given the probiotic recovered on day 7. A significantly smaller number of peripheral leukocytes and lower cytokine mRNA expression level might be induced by scouring in calves. Repeated probiotic administration might stimulate cellular immunity and encourage recovery from scouring in pre-weaning Holstein calves.
TI  - Effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes  and their cytokine mRNA expression in calves.
AB  - Eight Holstein calves (10 +/- 3 weeks) were used to examine the interaction between a bacteria-based probiotic agent (probiotic) and the function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The probiotic, consisting of Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium butyricum, was administered orally at 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to calves once daily for 5 consecutive days. Calves given the vehicle alone with no probiotic served as the control. In the treatment group, increases in numbers of CD282(+) (TLR2) monocytes, CD3(+) T cells and CD4(+), CD8(+) and WC1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets were noted on day 7 post-placement compared to predose day and the control group. Expression of interleukin (IL)-6, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was elevated in peripheral leukocytes on days 7 and 14. These results suggest that peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy calves may be stimulated via the gastrointestinal microbiota, which was increased by the oral probiotic treatment, with overall stability of the rumen bacterial flora. The 5-day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic may enhance cellular immune function in weaned calves.
TI  - Effects of Clostridium butyricum and Enterococcus faecium on growth performance,  lipid metabolism, and cecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  - To investigate the effects of Clostridium butyricum and Enterococcus faecium on the growth performance, lipid metabolism, and cecal microbiota of broilers, 264 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly allocated into four treatments with six replicates in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement and fed four diets with two levels of C. butyricum (0 or 1 x 10(9) cfu/kg) and two levels of E. faecium (0 or 2 x 10(9) cfu/kg) for 42 days. There was no significant interaction between C. butyricum and E. faecium on the growth performance, lipid metabolism, and cecal microbiota of broilers. However, broilers supplemented with E. faecium had lower (P = 0.022) serum leptin level at day 21 and higher (P < 0.001) fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) mRNA levels in the liver at day 42. Supplementation of C. butyricum improved (P < 0.05) the average daily feed intake and average daily gain, increased (P = 0.016) the serum insulin level at 21 days of age, enhanced (P < 0.05) the content of intramuscular fat, activities of FAS in the liver and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the breast muscle, mRNA expression of FAS, ME, and ACC in the liver and LPL in the breast muscle at 42 days of age, but reduced (P = 0.030) cecal Bacteroidetes relative abundance at 21 days of age. The results of this study indicate that the increased intramuscular fat content of broilers fed C. butyricum as observed may be the result of enhanced lipogenesis.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - [Effects of probiotics on intestinal bacterial colonization in premature infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the possible roles of probiotics in decreasing intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of enterogenic infections in premature infants. METHODS: Seventy premature infants were randomly assigned to two groups: probiotics and conventional treatment groups (control) (n=35 each). The probiotics treatment group was administered with oral Clostridium butyricum powder (250 mg, twice daily up to discharge) 24 hrs after birth except conventional treatment. Rectal swab cultures were done at admission, 5 and 12 days after admission, and before discharge. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The intestinal bacterial colonization rate in the probiotics treatment group was lower than that in the control group 12 days after admission (60% vs 83%; p<0.05) and before discharge (51% vs 80%; p<0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium were common colonization bacteria in the two groups. Diarrhea occurred in 7 cases (20%) in the probiotics treatment group compared with 16 cases (46%) in the control group (p<0.05). Two infants (6%) developed sepsis in the probiotics treatment group compared with 9 cases (26%) in the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics can decrease intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of diarrhea and sepsis in premature infants.
TI  - Description of the bacteriocins produced by two strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated from Italian goat milk.
AB  - In this study two strains of Enterococcus faecium, M241 and M249, isolated from goat milk, were studied for their capability to produce antibacterial compounds. It was determined that the bacteriocins produced by both strains were active towards Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium butyricum, and they did not have any activity with respect to other species of lactic acid bacteria. Enterocins A and B were targeted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced, after cloning, in both strains. The bacteriocins contained in the cell free supernatants were stable when subjected to treatments at high and low temperatures or with lipase, catalase and alpha-amylase. Whereas, the activity was lost when proteinases were used. Lastly, a co-culture experiment with L. monocytogenes in skimmed milk was performed. In the presence of the E. faecium strains, the pathogen showed a delay in the growth of about 6h and it reached a maximum counts of about 10(6) colony forming unit, two orders of magnitude low with respect to the control. This result suggests the possibility to use the strains studied as starter cultures to enhance food safety of dairy products.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Production and characterization of enterocin 900, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium BFE 900 from black olives.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BFE 900 isolated from black olives produced a bacteriocin termed enterocin 900, which was antagonistic towards Lactobacillus sake, Clostridium butyricum, enterococci as well as Listeria spp. including Listeria monocytogenes. Enterocin 900 was inactivated by pepsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, proteinase K and trypsin but not by catalase, alpha-amylase, or other non-proteolytic enzymes tested. The bacteriocin was heat stable, retaining activity after heating at 121 degrees C for 15 min. Enterocin 900 was active at pH values ranging from 2.0-10.0, with highest activity at pH 6.0. Bacteriocin production occurred in the late logarithmic growth phase when culture density was ca. log 8.0 CFU ml-1. Enterocin 900 was produced in media with initial pH ranging from 6.0-10.0, but not in media with a pH lower than 6.0. Medium composition, especially the concentrations of peptone and yeast extract influenced bacteriocin production, with no bacteriocin being produced in the absence of either of these compounds. No plasmids could be isolated from Enterococcus faecium BFE 900, indicating that the gene for bacteriocin activity is located on the chromosome.
