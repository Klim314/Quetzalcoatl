TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [bacterial flora in chronic inner ear infections in adults].
AB  == the aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically middle ear exudate obtained from 56 patients, aged 17 to 83 years, treated for chronic otitis media. aerobic  bacteria only were found 49 patients (87,5%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 7 patients (12,5%). the most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear exudate, in descending order frequency, were staphylococcus aureus (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (34%), proteus mirabilis (16%) and prevotella melaninogenica (9%). other organisms were isolated less frequently. in 34 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 22 patients the isolated bacteria coexisted with other microorganisms.

TI  == effect of anaerobic bacteria on killing of proteus mirabilis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == killing of proteus mirabilis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was tested in  the presence of different bacteroides species. in vitro experiments showed that anaerobic bacteria interfered with the killing of aerobic bacteria. however, this inhibitory effect was not a property of all bacteroides species. bacteroides gingivalis w83 showed the greatest inhibitory effect of the five bacteroides strains tested. killing of p. mirabilis was inhibited by the culture supernatant  of b. gingivalis but not by washed cells. two factors were found in the supernatant of b. gingivalis to account for the inhibitory effect. one was heat stable with a molecular weight of less than 3,500 and inhibited the killing activity of leukocytes, and the other was heat labile and partly inactivated the  complement system. the killing experiments paralleled chemiluminescence measurements.

TI  == impairment by bacteroides species of opsonisation and phagocytosis of enterobacteria.
AB  == the ability of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes to phagocytose and kill proteus mirabilis was impaired in vitro when the human serum, used to opsonise the target bacteria, was pretreated with cultures of various bacteroides species. live and dead, either heat-killed or clindamycin-treated, bacteroides cells elicited the same phenomenon. when bacteroides-treated serum was used to opsonise different proteus species, the subsequent uptake of all strains by polymorphonuclear leucocytes was inhibited, whereas bacteroides-treated serum inhibited the uptake  of some but not all of the test strains of escherichia coli. the opsonic activity of untreated human serum was reduced when the classical complement pathway was inhibited by ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)n,n'-tetra-acetic acid (egta); subsequent treatment with bacteroides did not further reduce the opsonic  activity of the serum for p. mirabilis.

TI  == inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro by obligate anaerobes.
AB  == a variety of species of obligate anaerobes have been shown to interfere with the  phagocytosis and killing of proteus mirabilis and other aerobic bacteria in vitro. although all the obligate anaerobes examined showed this activity, the effect was greatest with strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus and b. fragilis.  in contrast, none of the 36 aerobes tested acted in this way. these observations  suggest that the presence of obligate anaerobes may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of some types of infections.
