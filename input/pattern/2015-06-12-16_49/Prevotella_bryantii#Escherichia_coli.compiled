TI  - The 5' untranslated mRNA region base content can greatly affect translation initiation in the absence of secondary structures in Prevotella bryantii TC1-1.
AB  - It has become clear lately that many bacteria and even whole bacterial phyla do not use the classical Shine-Dalgarno sequence mediated pathway of protein translation initiation. The prominent phylum Bacteroidetes is one of them, and this was shown not only using bioinformatic but also functional reporter gene studies in its representative Prevotella bryantii. The latter studies revealed much higher sensitivity toward secondary structures in 5(') untranslated mRNA regions (5(') UTRs) during translation initiation compared to Escherichia coli. It was proposed that in the absence of Shine-Dalgarno sequence interaction the key elements enabling translation initiation are local absence of secondary structures in 5(') UTRs, and the ribosomal protein S1 which binds to mRNA. Here, we evaluate the 5(') UTRs devoid of secondary structures but containing divergent nucleotide compositions in P. bryantii reporter assay. We show that base composition profoundly affects the amount of the reporter synthesized, and further that these amounts were in agreement with S1 protein binding affinity for adenine/uracil bases in mRNA. This is the first, though indirect, clue that S1 is actually involved in translation initiation in Bacteroidetes and adds the second layer of control beside mRNA secondary structure affecting translation initiation in this phylum.
TI  - Inability of Prevotella bryantii to form a functional Shine-Dalgarno interaction  reflects unique evolution of ribosome binding sites in Bacteroidetes.
AB  - The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is a key element directing the translation to initiate at the authentic start codons and also enabling translation initiation to proceed in 5' untranslated mRNA regions (5'-UTRs) containing moderately strong secondary structures. Bioinformatic analysis of almost forty genomes from the major bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes revealed, however, a general absence of SD sequence, drop in GC content and consequently reduced tendency to form secondary structures in 5'-UTRs. The experiments using the Prevotella bryantii TC1-1 expression system were in agreement with these findings: neither addition nor omission of SD sequence in the unstructured 5'-UTR affected the level of the reporter protein, non-specific nuclease NucB. Further, NucB level in P. bryantii TC1-1, contrary to hMGFP level in Escherichia coli, was five times lower when SD sequence formed part of the secondary structure with a folding energy -5,2 kcal/mol. Also, the extended SD sequences did not affect protein levels as in E. coli. It seems therefore that a functional SD interaction does not take place during the translation initiation in P. bryanttii TC1-1 and possibly other members of phylum Bacteroidetes although the anti SD sequence is present in 16S rRNA genes of their genomes. We thus propose that in the absence of the SD sequence interaction, the selection of genuine start codons in Bacteroidetes is accomplished by binding of ribosomal protein S1 to unstructured 5'-UTR as opposed to coding region which is inaccessible due to mRNA secondary structure. Additionally, we found that sequence logos of region preceding the start codons may be used as taxonomical markers. Depending on whether complete sequence logo or only part of it, such as information content and base proportion at specific positions, is used, bacterial genera or families and in some cases even bacterial phyla can be distinguished.
TI  - Functional diversity of four glycoside hydrolase family 3 enzymes from the rumen  bacterium Prevotella bryantii B14.
AB  - Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzymes.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel xylanase from the symbiotic Sphingobacterium sp. TN19.
AB  - A xylanase-encoding gene, designated xynA19, was cloned from Sphingobacterium sp. TN19--a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of Batocera horsfieldi larvae--and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The full-length xynA19 (1,155 bp in length) encodes a 384-residue polypeptide (XynA19) containing a predicted signal peptide of 24 residues and a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (GH 10). The deduced amino acid sequence of XynA19 is most similar (53.1% identity) to an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from Prevotella bryantii B(1)4. Phylogenetic analysis of GH 10 Bacteroidia xylanases indicated that GH 10 xylanases from Sphingobacteria were separated into two clusters, and XynA19 is more closely related to the xylanases of Bacteroidia from gut or rumen than to those of Flavobacteria and Sphingobacteria from other sources. Recombinant XynA19 (r-XynA19) showed apparent optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 45 degrees C. Compared with thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts, r-XynA19 was more active at low temperatures, retaining >65% of its maximum activity at 20-28 degrees C and approximately 40% even at 10 degrees C, and modeling indicated that XynA19 has fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. These properties suggest that XynA19 has various potential applications, especially in aquaculture and the food industry.
TI  - Expression of nuclease gene nucA, a member of an operon putatively involved in uracil removal from DNA and its subsequent reuse in Prevotella bryantii.
AB  - The genomic region of Prevotella bryantii TC1-1 that conferred an increased nucleolytic activity on Escherichia coli was characterized. It contains two divergent transcriptional units separated by an AT-rich promoter region. One unit is comprised of three genes involved in nucleotide metabolism. nucA, the first gene of this unit, whose product belongs to exonuclease/endonuclease/phosphatase Pfam family, was thought to be required for the increased nucleolytic activity and various expression strategies were employed to confirm its role. The nucA expression was only successful in cell free system where DNase and RNase activity was observed. Two genes downstream of nucA code for a putative uracil DNA glycosylase and uridine kinase which could be involved in the removal of misincorporated uracil from DNA and its reuse. Given that apurinic/apyrimidinic nuclease activity is required after uracil removal from DNA, it was somewhat surprising to find out that nucA, whose product belongs to protein family consisting mostly of apurinic/apyrimidinic nucleases, has no apurinic/apyrimidinic activity.
TI  - Type II restriction modification systems of Prevotella bryantii TC1-1 and Prevotella ruminicola 23 strains and their effect on the efficiency of DNA introduction via electroporation.
AB  - The restriction endonucleases PbrTI and Pru2I, isoschizomers of Sau3AI and HaeIII, were partially purified and characterized from anaerobic rumen bacteria Prevotella bryantii TC1-1 and Prevotella ruminicola 23, respectively. These are the first type II restriction endonucleases discovered in strains of the genus Prevotella, and they represent one of the barriers hindering gene transfer in these microorganisms. Heterologous DNA was protected against the action of the PbrTI or Pru2I by incubation in a cell-free extract of the respective strain which contained 20 mM EDTA. This led to the development of a protocol enabling successful electrotransformation of the P. bryantii TC1-1 strain with a pRH3 Bacteroides--Escherichia coli shuttle vector containing up to 7-kb long DNA inserts. Plasmid DNA isolated from the transformed strain facilitated the transfer with further increased efficiency and made possible the introduction of ligation reaction products directly to P. bryantii TC1-1 without passing them first through E. coli.
TI  - The glutamine synthetase of Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a family III enzyme (GlnN) and glutamine supports growth of mutants lacking glutamate dehydrogenase activity.
AB  - Prevotella spp. are believed to play a central role in ruminal nitrogen metabolism, but little is understood about the genetics and biochemistry of nitrogen assimilation and regulation in these bacteria. The gene encoding a family III glutamine synthetase (GSIII, glnN) in Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 was cloned by Escherichia coli mutant complementation, and enzyme assays as well as Northern blot analysis showed that maximal enzyme activity and glnN transcription occurred in cells grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Addition of methionine sulfoximine (MSX), a GS inhibitor, terminated bacterial growth when ammonium was provided as the sole nitrogen source, but the inhibitory effect could be overcome by the inclusion of either L-glutamine or trypticase in the growth medium. A P. bryantii mutant lacking glutamate dehydrogenase (GdhA) activity was isolated by ethylmethylsulfonate mutagenesis. Growth studies with different nitrogen sources showed that the mutant strain was still capable of growth with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, albeit at a decreased growth rate. The mutant strain could also grow with L-glutamine as a nitrogen source in the presence of MSX. These data suggest that GlnN provides an effective route of ammonium assimilation for P. bryantii, in addition to that afforded by the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway.
TI  - Involvement of the multidomain regulatory protein XynR in positive control of xylanase gene expression in the ruminal anaerobe Prevotella bryantii B(1)4.
AB  - The xylanase gene cluster from the rumen anaerobe Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 was found to include a gene (xynR) that encodes a multidomain regulatory protein and is downstream from the xylanase and beta-xylosidase genes xynA and xynB. Additional genes identified upstream of xynA and xynB include xynD, which encodes an integral membrane protein that has homology with Na:solute symporters; xynE, which is related to the genes encoding acylhydrolases and arylesterases; and xynF, which has homology with the genes encoding alpha-glucuronidases. XynR includes, in a single 833-amino-acid polypeptide, a putative input domain unrelated to other database sequences, a likely transmembrane domain, histidine kinase motifs, response regulator sequences, and a C-terminal AraC-type helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. Two transcripts (3.7 and 5.8 kb) were detected with a xynA probe, and the start site of the 3.7-kb transcript encoding xynABD was mapped to a position upstream of xynD. The DNA binding domain of XynR was purified after amplification and overexpression in Escherichia coli and was found to bind to a 141-bp DNA fragment from the region immediately upstream of xynD. In vitro transcription assays demonstrated that XynR stimulates transcription of the 3.7-kb transcript. We concluded that XynR acts as a positive regulator that activates expression of xynABD in P. bryantii B(1)4. This is the first regulatory protein that demonstrates significant homology with the two-component regulatory protein superfamily and has been shown to be involved in the regulation of polysaccharidase gene expression.
TI  - Non-specific DNAases from the rumen bacterium Prevotella bryantii.
AB  - Extracellular non-specific nucleases were observed in some strains belonging to the ruminal species of the genus Prevotella, mostly P. brevis and P. bryantii. The nuclease from P. bryantii appeared to be extracellular; it mediates the degradation of the supercoiled plasmid DNA via an open circle intermediate. The cleavage is not site specific although a preference for certain cleavage sites does seem to exist. Our attempts to clone the wild-type P. bryantii B(1)4 nuclease in E. coli strain ER1992 that reports on the DNA damage sustained, were unsuccessful probably due to excessive intracellular nuclease activity that killed the cells bearing the gene for the nuclease. On the other hand, the nuclease from a related strain TCl-1, which has a less active enzyme of the same type, was successfully cloned.
