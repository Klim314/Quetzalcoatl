TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide is prevented by the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were exposed to various combinations of the components of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system. the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide was prevented under anaerobic conditions by lactoperoxidase together with thiocyanate, but not by lactoperoxidase or thiocyanate alone. thiocyanate was effective already at a molar ratio to hydrogen peroxide of 1:100.
