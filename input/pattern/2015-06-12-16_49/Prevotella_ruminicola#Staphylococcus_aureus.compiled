TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
