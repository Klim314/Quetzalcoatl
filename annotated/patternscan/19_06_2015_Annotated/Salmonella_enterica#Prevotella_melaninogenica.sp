TI  == induction of oxidative dna damage in anaerobes.
AB  == we compared oxidative dna damage in strictly anaerobic prevotella melaninogenica, aerotolerant anaerobic bacteroides fragilis, and facultative anaerobic salmonella typhimurium after exposure to o2 or h2o2. using hplc with electrochemical detection, we measured 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8ohdg) as a damage marker. o2 induced 8ohdg in p. melaninogenica but not in b. fragilis, which shows catalase activity, or in s. typhimurium. in p. melaninogenica, with catalase, o2 induced less 8ohdg; superoxide dismutase had no effect; with glucose and glucose oxidase, o2 induced more 8ohdg. h2o2 also markedly increased 8ohdg. o2 was suggested to induce 8ohdg through h2o2. o2 or h2o2 decreased survival only in p. melaninogenica. highly sensitive to oxidative stress, p. melaninogenica could prove useful for investigating oxidative dna damage.
