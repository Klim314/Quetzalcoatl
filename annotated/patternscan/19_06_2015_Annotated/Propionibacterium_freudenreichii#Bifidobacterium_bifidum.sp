TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.
AB  == we previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the platelia aspergillus (pa) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (m. a. s. h. mennink-kersten, r. r. klont, a. warris, h. j. m. op den camp, and p. e. verweij, lancet 363:325-327, 2004). we tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the pa elisa, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and tested for pa elisa reactivity. all bifidobacteria, except b. infantis and b. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., micrococcus luteus and propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. elisa reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. all neonatal feces showed pa elisa reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum pa elisa reactivity in selected patient groups,  especially neonates.

TI  == detection of aminotransferase activity of propionibacterium freudenreichii after  sds-page.
AB  == aminotransferases (ats) had previously been detected after native electrophoresis. we show now that aminotransferase(s) of propionibacterium freudenreichii can be detected after sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). moreover, it retained a high activity (84%) in the presence of 0.23% sds, contrary to what was observed for aminotransferase(s) of bifidobacterium bifidum (54%) and of six other cheese-related species (0-20%).
