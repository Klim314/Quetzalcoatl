TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == in vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  == synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. however, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition  has not been determined. eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four  probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h ph-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. the prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using fish. rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group. lower levels of escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10  h of fermentation. probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of lactobacillus-enterococcus were observed when the  probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == effect of a milk formula containing probiotics on the fecal microbiota of asian infants at risk of atopic diseases.
AB  == the fecal microbiota of 37 infants with (n = 20) or without (n = 17) probiotic administration was evaluated on d 3, and at 1, 3, and 12 mo by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry (fish-fc), pcr, and bacteriological culture methods. they represent consecutive subjects of an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on a probiotic formula (lgg and bifidobacterium longum)  administered during the first 6 mo of life. despite varying composition in each baby, there was a general bacterial colonization pattern in the first year. bifidobacteria increased markedly (p = 0.0003) with a parallel decrease in enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001) and bacteroides-prevotella (p = 0.005) populations. eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides (p < 0.001) and atopobium  (p = 0.039) groups also gradually increased. this overall pattern was unaffected  by probiotic administration (p > 0.05). b. longum (p = 0.005) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (p < 0.001) were detected more frequently in probiotic group during supplementation, but no difference after supplementation had ceased (p > 0.05). cultured lactic acid bacteria were also more numerous in the probiotic-administered babies during treatment period (log cfu/g 8.4 versus 7.4;  p = 0.035). our results indicate that supplemented strains could be detected but  did not persist in the bowel once probiotic administration had ceased.

TI  == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
AB  == liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such  as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.
