TI  == clostridium homopropionicum sp. nov., a new strict anaerobe growing with 2-, 3-,  or 4-hydroxybutyrate.
AB  == from anoxic sewage sludge a new strictly anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium was isolated with 2-hydroxybutyrate as sole substrate. 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-chlorobutyrate, crotonate, vinylacetate, and pyruvate were fermented to acetate and butyrate. fructose was converted to acetate, butyrate, butanol, and h2. lactate and acrylate were fermented to acetate and propionate. cells pregrown with lactate fermented 2-hydroxybutyrate to butyrate, propionate and acetate. no  inorganic electron acceptors were reduced. the dna base ratio was 32.0 +/- 1.0 mol% and was similar to that of clostridium propionicum, which was determined to  be 35.3 +/- 0.5 mol%. strain luhbu1 is described as type strain of a new species, clostridium homopropionicum sp. nov. another isolate obtained from marine sediment degraded 2- and 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetate and butyrate and was in some respects similar to the known species ilyobacter polytropus.
