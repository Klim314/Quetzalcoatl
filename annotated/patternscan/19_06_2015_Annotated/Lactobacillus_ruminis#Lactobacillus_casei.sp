TI  == distinctive intestinal lactobacillus communities in six-month-old infants from rural malawi and south-western finland.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in malawi and south-western finland. methods: the composition and diversity of the lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural malawi (n = 44) and south-western finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qpcr)  and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (dgge). results: malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the malawian infants.  leuconostoc citreum and weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). moreover, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the malawian infants (59.1  % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). however, lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the finnish infants. conclusions: malawian infants  have a more abundant lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to finnish infants. the environment, including diet and hygiene, may be  among the factors influencing these differences.

TI  == reduction of the enniatins a, a(1), b, b(1) by an in vitro degradation employing  different strains of probiotic bacteria: identification of degradation products by lc-ms-lit.
AB  == the degradation of the fusarium mycotoxins ens by 9 bacterial strains characteristic of the gastrointestinal tract like bb. longum, bb. bifidum, bb. breve, bb. adolescentes, lb. rhamnosus, lb. casei-casei, s. termofilus, lb. ruminis, lb. casei and twenty two strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. the fermentations were carried out in the liquid medium of de man rogosa sharpe (mrs) under anaerobic conditions for bifidobacteria streptococcus and lactobacillus, and in potato dextrose broth (pdb) for saccharomyces strains, during 48 h. the degradation of the bioactive compounds ens was also studied in a food system composed by wheat flour naturally contaminated by ens through fermentation by a strain of fusarium tricinctum. the determination of the ens in  the fermentation mediums was performed using the technique of the liquid chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometry detector in tandem (lc-ms/ms), whereas the identification of the degradation products produced by microbial fermentation was carried out using the technique of the lc coupled to the linear  ion trap (lit). all the bacteria analyzed in this study showed a significant ens  reduction in vitro during the fermentation processes, with degradation data ranging from 5 to the 99%. in the food system, the ens degradation data evidenced ranged from 1.3 to 49.2%. also three ens degradation products were identified.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
