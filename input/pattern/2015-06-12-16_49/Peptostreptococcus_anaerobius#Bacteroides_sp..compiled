TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - [The role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  - Altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. Microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species Peptococcus asacharolyticus, Pc. sacharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides asacharolyticus and B. melaninogenicus. The remaining isolates were classified as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium. In the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (Tab. I) were carried out. Their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (Tab. II). Capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (Tab. III). In the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. The anaerobic genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of the samples both species occurred). According to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. Of the latter, those belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are of major importance.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'. Varelic acid was not detected in Group D; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to Group D'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.
TI  - Moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Sixty patients were treated: 30 with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. There were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). The infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. The most frequently isolated possible pathogens were Bacteroides sp. (37), Bacteroides bivius (23), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), Escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and Gardnerella vaginalis (38). Clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of 30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. Moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. Clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Death of an African elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  - A 31-year-old captive male African elephant (Loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. Lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, Grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. Nonhemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium sp, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. We postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
