TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
