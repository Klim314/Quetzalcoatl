TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) from chlamydia trachomatis versus pid from neisseria gonorrhea: from clinical suspicion to therapy.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is the most significant complication of sexually transmitted infections in childbearing-age women and it represents an important public health problem because of its long-term sequelae (chronic pelvic pain, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy). prior to the mid 1970s pid was considered a monoetiologic infection, due primarily to neisseria gonorrhea. now it is well documented as a polymicrobial process, with a great number of microrganisms involved. in addition to neisseria gonorrhea and chlamydia trachomatis, other vaginal microrganisms (anaerobes, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, enteric gram negative rods, streptococco agalactie, mycoplasma genitalium) also have been associated with pid. there is a wide variation in pid clinical features; the type and severity of symptoms vary by microbiologic etiology. women who have chlamydial pid seem more likely than women who have gonococcal pid to be asymptomatic. since clinical diagnosis is imprecise, the suspicion of pid should be confirmed by genital assessment for signs of inflammation or infection, blood test and imaging evaluation. laparoscopic approach is considered the gold standard. according to the polymicrobial etiology of pid, antibiotic treatment must provide broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. early administration of antibiotics is necessary to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

TI  == anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal g. vaginalis  in both genders. from a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with  a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. at least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). s. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. g. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.

TI  == pcr primers and probes for the 16s rrna gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == a comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of temafloxacin compared with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == temafloxacin, like other 4-quinolones, was highly active against most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. it was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin but approximately as active as ofloxacin and enoxacin. it was the most active of the  quinolones against acinetobacter spp. and xanthomonas maltophilia but was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. temafloxacin was highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae and was the most active of the quinolones against gardnerella vaginalis and campylobacter coli/jejuni. it was more active than ciprofloxacin against most staphylococci and equally active against streptococci and enterococci. temafloxacin was the most active quinolone against anaerobic bacteria and, with the exception of a few isolates of bacteroides spp. and some clostridia, all anaerobes were within the sensitive range (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l).

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

TI  == identification of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the microscan haemophilus-neisseria identification panel.
AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.

AB  == mics of pd127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of ci934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. pd127,391 was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp (mics less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against aeromonas spp. (mics less than 0.008 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics less than 1 mg/l). it was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. including ps. maltophilia (mics less than  0.25 mg/l). all three drugs had high activity, with pd129,391 again the best, against haemophilus influenzae brahmamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. pd127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against campylobacter coli/jejuni (pd127,391 mics less than 0.03 mg/l) and gardnerella vaginalis (pd127,391 mics less than 0.25 mg/l). pd127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than ci934 or ciprofloxacin. pd127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including clostridium difficile) (mics less than 1 mg/l) than was ci934 (mics less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (mics less than 64 mg/l). no bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of pd127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.

TI  == trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, in comparison with that of erythromycin.
AB  == a study was made of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin in comparison with that of erythromycin on selected recent clinical isolates of a wide range of organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by an agar dilution method with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) and the effect of ph were determined by a broth dilution method on selected strains. in general the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin mirrored that of erythromycin, but it was slightly less active. most strains of streptococci, with the exception of enterococci, were highly sensitive to roxithromycin, as were isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. staphylococci and enterococci were only moderately sensitive to both agents as was haemophilus influenzae. most anaerobic bacteria were sensitive although bacteroides fragilis, fusobacteria and some strains of some clostridial species were moderately resistant. the mbcs were usually at least 16-fold higher than mics for most staphylococci, enterococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci and b. fragilis; but for beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis the mbcs were usually only 2- to 4-fold higher than mics. roxithromycin was most active at ph 8 and generally for each unit fall in ph there was a 4-fold diminution of activity. however, the effect was less marked for pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and h. influenzae.

AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, a-56619, a-56620 and ci-934 was assessed by determination of mics. the 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and a-56619 (mics 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. a-56619, a-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ci-934 were highly active against acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. all the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against aeromonas strains (mics 0.001-0.12 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa; a-56619 and ci-934 (mics 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. all the compounds were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. all the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and ci-934 (mics 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. ci-934 (mics 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. against the anaerobic bacteria ci-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, a-56619 and a-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. all three compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for acinetobacter and pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (mics 8-32 mg/l). staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the mics of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. variants of enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected  in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. the mics of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == salient features of haemophilus vaginalis.
AB  == a total of 78 strains of haemophilus vaginalis were examined for 104 features. all strains fermented dextrin, maltose, and starch. additionally, more than 90% of the strains fermented galactose, glucose, and ribose. arbutin, cellobiose, melibiose, rhamnose, and salicin were not fermented by any of these strains. none of the strains acidified any of 14 alcohols or alkalinized any of 25 organic salts and amides. more than 90% of the strains hemolyzed human blood agar and hydrolyzed hippurate. no strain hemolyzed sheep blood agar. a recommendation is included for those minimal features that best differentiate h. vaginalis from other oxidase- and catalase-negative, gram-negative organisms.
