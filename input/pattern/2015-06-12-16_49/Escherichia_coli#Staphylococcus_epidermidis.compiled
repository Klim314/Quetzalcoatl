TI  - A plasmid-borne system to assess the excision and integration of Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) mediated by CcrA and CcrB.
AB  - Resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics in staphylococci is due to mecA, which is carried on a genomic island, SCCmec. The chromosomal excision and integration of SCCmec is mediated by the site-specific recombinases CcrAB or CcrC encoded within this element. A plasmid-borne system was constructed to assess the activities of CcrA and CcrB in the excision and integration of SCCmec in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The excision frequency in E. coli mediated by CcrAB from methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain N315 was only 9.2%, while the integration frequency was 31.4%. In S. aureus the excision and integration frequencies were 11.0% and 18.7%, respectively. Truncated mutants identified the N-terminal domain of either CcrB or CcrA as necessary for both integration and excision while the C terminal domain was important for recombination efficiency. Site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal domain identified S11 and R79 of CcrA and S16, R89, T149 and R151 of CcrB as essential residues for catalytic activities and the critical location of these residues was consistent with a model of the tertiary structure of the N terminus of CcrA and CcrB. Furthermore, CcrAB and CcrC, cloned from a panel of 6 methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains carrying SCCmec types II, IV and V also catalyzed integration at rates 1.3 to-10 times higher than that of excision, similar to the results from N315. The tendency of SCCmec integration to be favored over excision may explain the low spontaneous excision frequency seen among MRSA. IMPORTANCE: Spontaneous excision of the genomic island (SCCmec) that encodes resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in staphylococci (methicillin resistance) would convert a methicillin resistant to a methicillin susceptible strain, improving therapy of difficult infections. This study characterizes a model system by which the relative frequencies of excision and integration can be compared. Using a plasmid-based model for excision and integration mediated by the recombinases CcrA and CcrB, integration occurred at a higher frequency than excision, consistent with the low baseline excision frequency seen in most strains. This model system can now be used to study conditions and drugs that may raise the SCCmec excision frequency and generate strains that are beta-lactam susceptible.
TI  - Gut Catalase-Positive Bacteria Cross-Protect Adjacent Bifidobacteria from Oxidative Stress.
AB  - Bifidobacteria isolated from infant gut and breast milk exhibited different abilities to grow under microaerobic conditions, alone or in the presence of added catalase. In the present study, we demonstrated that some Bifidobacterium strains unable to grow under microaerobic conditions were cross-protected on solid media from oxidative stress by adjacent colonies of gut catalase-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli, but not by a catalase-deficient E. coli. The results of this study support the possible contribution of catalase-positive bacteria to the establishment of certain bifidobacteria in non-anaerobic human niches of the infant gastrointestinal tract or mammary gland.
TI  - Variation in bacterial ATP concentration during rapid changes in extracellular pH and implications for the activity of attached bacteria.
AB  - In this study we investigated the relationship between a rapid change in extracellular pH and the alteration of bacterial ATP concentration. This relationship is a key component of a hypothesis indicating that bacterial bioenergetics - the creation of ATP from ADP via a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane - can be altered by the physiochemical charge-regulation effect, which results in a pH shift at the bacteria's surface upon adhesion to another surface. The bacterial ATP concentration was measured during a rapid change in extracellular pH from a baseline pH of 7.2 to pH values between 3.5 and 10.5. Experiments were conducted with four neutrophilic bacterial strains, including the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. A change in bulk pH produced an immediate response in bacterial ATP, demonstrating a direct link between changes in extracellular pH and cellular bioenergetics. In general, the shifts in ATP were similar across the four bacterial strains, with results following an exponential relationship between the extracellular pH and cellular ATP concentration. One exception occurred with S. epidermidis, where there was no variation in cellular ATP at acidic pH values, and this finding is consistent with this species' ability to thrive under acidic conditions. These results provide insight into obtaining a desired bioenergetic response in bacteria through (i) the application of chemical treatments to vary the local pH and (ii) the selection and design of surfaces resulting in local pH modification of attached bacteria via the charge-regulation effect.
TI  - The pathophysiological role of bacterial biofilms in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a very common disorder that remains poorly understood from a pathogenic standpoint. Recent research on the pathogenesis of CRS has been focused on the potential role of biofilms in this chronic infection. The aim of this study was to assess the sinuses' microflora and biofilm formation on the sino-nasal mucosa in patients with CRS. Paranasal sinus mucosa specimens were harvested at the time of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Classical microbiology techniques for the isolation and identification of sinus mucosa microbial flora were used. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to detect biofilm on the surface of mucosa. A microtiter plate assay for in vitro biofilm formation was employed, divided into three aliquots. One part was assessed for bacterial presence, utilizing an API manual system and the Vitek(R) 2 Compact system. The two remaining aliquots were tested by in vitro conventional microbiological assay with the use of the Infinite M200 (Tecan) microtiter plate reader, and also by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A microbiological examination of mucosal specimens had taken during FESS operation revealed the presence of various types of bacteria in 29 out of 30 tested samples. Out of 62 different strains isolated from patients with CRS, 23 strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis and 6 strains of Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, accounting for 37.1 and 9.7 %, respectively. Among the 62 isolated strains, 58 were used to assess biofilm formation. From the total of 58 isolates, 8.6 % were strong biofilm producers, 20.7 % were moderate, and 70.7 % of isolates were considered to be non- or weak biofilm producers. SEM of the 30 nasal concha mucosal samples taken from patients with CRS revealed biofilm in 23 specimens. A marked destruction of the epithelium was observed, with variation in degrees of severity, from disarrayed cilia to complete absence of cilia. The vast majority of nasal concha mucosal samples of patients affected by chronic sinusitis presented with biofilm formation. Our study showed that 76.7 % of patients having FESS for CRS had evidence of biofilms on SEM micrographs. Although certain detection methods could lead to various discrepancies in the amount of biofilm produced, the consistent demonstration of biofilms in patients with CRS suggests that this convoluted three-dimensional structures might play a significant role in either the pathogenesis or persistence of chronic rhinosinusitis.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - [Epidemiology of neonatal purulent meningitis in Hebei Province, China: a multicenter study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and main pathogenic bacteria, and outcomes of neonatal purulent meningitis. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study was conducted in neonates with purulent meningitis admitted to 23 cooperating hospitals between 2013 and 2014. Clinical data were collected and clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 301 neonates with purulent meningitis from the 23 cooperating hospitals were included. Neonatal pneumonia was the most common primary disease (167 cases, 55.5%). Fever was the most common manifestation (214 cases, 71.1%). Blood culture findings were positive in 72 patients (23.9%), with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was found in 36 patients (36/264, 13.6%) , with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. The median of CSF WBC counts was 80/mm(3) (range: 0-9 2500/mm(3)), and 11 cases (3.7%) had CSF WBC counts of <20/mm(3) and 154 cases (51.2%) had CSF WBC counts of >100/mm(3). There were 258 patients (85.7%) who were cured or improved at discharge and 15 deaths (15/298, 5.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common primary disease of neonatal purulent meningitis is neonatal pneumonia in this area. The patients with neonatal purulent meningitis most often present with fever. Escherichia coli is the leading pathogenic bacteria causing neonatal purulent meningitis. A normal CSF WBC count can barely be used to exclude the possibility of this diosorder.
TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Quaternized chitosans bind onto preexisting biofilms and eradicate pre-attached microorganisms.
AB  - Quaternized chitosans, N,N,N-trimethylchitosans (TMC) with different degree of quaternization were synthesized by reacting methyl iodide with chitosan. The reaction was confirmed by FT-IR and 1H-NMR characterization. Antimicrobial assay showed that the prepared TMC had potent biocidal effects against planktonic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, and yeast Candida albicans. Bacterial and fungal biofilms were formed on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and then treated with TMC aqueous solutions. Zeta potential measurement suggested that TMC bonded onto the preexisting biofilms. Biofilm-binding kinetics was evaluated in UV studies using phenyl group-labeled TMC as model compounds, which revealed that quaternized chitosans bonded onto the preexisting biofilms rapidly. Colony-forming unit (CFU) determination and SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that the bonded TMC had powerful biocidal activities to eradicate the pre-attached bacterial and fungal cells in the preexisting biofilms. The biocompatibility of the TMC samples with rat skin fibroblast cells was evaluated in the MTT assay.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Mechanism of cell integration on biomaterial implant surfaces in the presence of  bacterial contamination.
AB  - Bacterial contamination during biomaterial implantation is often unavoidable, yielding a combat between cells and bacteria. Here we aim to determine the modulatory function of bacterial components on stem-cell, fibroblast, and osteoblast adhesion to a titanium alloy, including the role of toll-like-receptors (TLRs). Presence of heat-sacrificed Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced dose and cell-type dependent responses. Stem-cells were most sensitive to bacterial presence, demonstrating decreased adhesion number yet increased adhesion effort with a relatively large focal adhesion contact area. Blocking TLRs had no effect on stem-cell adhesion in presence of S. aureus, but blocking both TLR2 and TLR4 induced an increased adhesion effort in presence of E. coli. Neither lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, nor bacterial DNA provoked the same cell response as did whole bacteria. Herewith we suggest a new mechanism as to how biomaterials are integrated by cells despite the unavoidable presence of bacterial contamination. Stimulation of host cell integration of implant surfaces may open a new window to design new biomaterials with enhanced healing, thereby reducing the risk of biomaterial-associated infection of both "hardware-based" implants as well as of tissue-engineered constructs, known to suffer from similarly high infection risks as currently prevailing in "hardware-based" implants.

TI  - Metabolic pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic airway infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (CF) patients. Complex interplays between P. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. METHODS: We generated a library of PA14 transposon insertion mutants to identify P. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with S. aureus, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and K. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Whereas wild-type PA14 inhibited S. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsC and carB, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. PqsC is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carB is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. The carB mutant was also unable to grow in the presence of B. cepacia and K. pneumoniae but not Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. We further identified a transposon insertion in purF, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. This mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of Gram-negative but not of Gram-positive bacteria. We identified a beneficial interaction in a bioA transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. This growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of K. pneumoniae or E. coli. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing CF-lungs. This work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between P. aeruginosa and three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. Manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Composition, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activity of Origanum dictamnus (dittany) essential oil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there has been an increased interest in essential oils from various plant origins as potential antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative agents. This trend can be mainly attributed to the rising number and severity of food poisoning outbreaks worldwide along with the recent negative consumer perception against artificial food additives and the demand for novel functional foods with possible health benefits. Origanum dictamnus (dittany) is an aromatic, tender perennial plant that only grows wild on the mountainsides and gorges of the island of Crete in Greece. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties of O. dictamnus essential oil and its main components and assess its commercial potential in the food industry. DESIGN: O. dictamnus essential oil was initially analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine semi-quantitative chemical composition of the essential oils. Subsequently, the antimicrobial properties were assayed and the minimum inhibitory and non-inhibitory concentration values were determined. The antioxidant activity and cytotoxic action against the hepatoma adenocarcinoma cell line HepG2 of the essential oil and its main components were further evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, respectively. RESULTS: The main constituents of O. dictamnus essential oil identified by GC-MS analysis were carvacrol (52.2%), gamma-terpinene (8.4%), p-cymene (6.1%), linalool (1.4%), and caryophyllene (1.3%). O. dictamnus essential oil and its main components were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger. In addition, the estimated IC50 value for the DPPH radical scavenging activity for O. dictamnus essential oil was 0.045+/-0.0042% (v/v) and was mainly attributed to carvacrol. The EC50 value for the essential oil in the 72h SRB assay in HepG2 cells was estimated to be 0.0069+/-0.00014% (v/v). Among the individual constituents tested, carvacrol was the most bioactive compound and accounted for the observed antiproliferative activity of the essential oil. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that O. dictamnus essential oil is a noteworthy growth inhibitor against the microbes studied. It also possesses significant antioxidant activity and demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells. Taken together, O. dictamnus essential oil may represent an effective and inexpensive source of potent natural antimicrobial agents with health-promoting properties, which may be incorporated in food systems.
TI  - Antipsychotics inhibit glucose transport: Determination of olanzapine binding site in Staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/H(+) symporter.
AB  - The antipsychotic drug olanzapine is widely prescribed to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, it often causes unwanted side effects, including diabetes, due to disruption of insulin-dependant glucose metabolism through a mechanism yet to be elucidated. To determine if olanzapine can affect the first step in glucose metabolism - glucose transport inside cells - we investigated the effect of this drug on the transport activity of a model glucose transporter. The glucose transporter from Staphylococcus epidermidis (GlcPSe) is specific for glucose, inhibited by various human glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitors, has high sequence and structure homology to GLUTs, and is readily amenable to transport assay, mutagenesis, and computational modeling. We found that olanzapine inhibits glucose transport of GlcPSe with an IC50 0.9 +/- 0.1 mM. Computational docking of olanzapine to the GlcPSe structure revealed potential binding sites that were further examined through mutagenesis and transport assay to identify residues important for olanzapine inhibition. These investigations suggest that olanzapine binds in a polar region of the cytosolic part of the transporter, and interacts with residues R129, strictly conserved in all GLUTs, and N136, conserved in only a few GLUTs, including the insulin-responsive GLUT4. We propose that olanzapine inhibits GlcPSe by impeding the alternating opening and closing of the substrate cavity necessary for glucose transport. It accomplishes this by disrupting a key salt bridge formed by conserved residues R129 and E362, that stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of the transporter.
TI  - Development of Gendine Coated Cannula for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion for Extended Use.
AB  - Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. One of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of CSII is CSII set related issues including infection at the infusion site. Current American Diabetic Association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. This adds cost and creates inconvenience. Therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a Teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (Gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. Cannulas were coated with Gendine on exterior surface and dried. Efficacy and durability of Gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. Cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. Gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (P < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. Gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. Our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.
TI  - Anti-sessile bacterial and cytocompatibility properties of CHX-loaded nanohydroxyapatite.
AB  - Nanohydroxyapatite possesses exceptional biocompatibility and bioactivity regarding bone cells and tissues, justifying its use as a coating material or as a bone substitute. Unfortunately, this feature may also encourage bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Surface functionalization with antimicrobials is a promising strategy to reduce the likelihood of bacterial infestation and colonization on medical devices. Chlorhexidine digluconate is a common and effective antimicrobial agent used for a wide range of medical applications. The purpose of this work was the development of a nanoHA biomaterial loaded with CHX to prevent surface bacterial accumulation and, simultaneously, with good cytocompatibility, for application in the medical field. CHX (5-1500mg/L) was loaded onto nanoHA discs and the materials were evaluated for CHX adsorption and release profile, physic-chemical features, antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and cytocompatibility toward L929 fibroblasts. Results showed that the adsorption of CHX on nanoHA surface occurred by electrostatic interactions between the cationic group of CHX and the phosphate group of nanoHA. The release of CHX from CHX-loaded nanoHA showed a fast initial rate followed by a slower kinetics release, due to constraints caused by dilution and diffusion-limiting processes. NanoHA.50 to nanoHA.1500 showed strong anti-sessile activity, inhibiting bacterial adhesion and the biofilm formation. CHX-nanoHA caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts for nanoHA.100 to nanoHA.1500. Cellular behavior on nanoHA.5 and nanoHA.50 was similar to control. Therefore, CHX-loaded nanoHA surfaces appear as a promising alternative to prevention of devices-related infections.
TI  - Multilayer hydrogel coatings to combine hemocompatibility and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - While silver-loaded catheters are widely used to prevent early-onset catheter-related infections [1], long term antimicrobial protection of indwelling catheters remains to be achieved [2] and antiseptic functionalization of coatings often impairs their hemocompatibility characteristics. Therefore, this work aimed to capitalize on the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles, incorporated in anticoagulant poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-heparin hydrogel coatings [3] on thermoplastic polyurethane materials. For prolonged antimicrobial activity, the silver-containing starPEG-heparin hydrogel layers were shielded with silver-free hydrogel layers of otherwise similar composition. The resulting multi-layered gel coatings showed long term antiseptic efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in vitro, and similarly performed well when incubated with freshly drawn human whole blood with respect to hemolysis, platelet activation and plasmatic coagulation. The introduced hydrogel multilayer system thus offers a promising combination of hemocompatibility and long-term antiseptic capacity to meet an important clinical need.
TI  - Inhibition of various gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria growth on selenium nanoparticle coated paper towels.
AB  - There are wide spread bacterial contamination issues on various paper products, such as paper towels hanging in sink splash zones or those used to clean surfaces, filter papers used in water and air purifying systems, and wrappings used in the food industry; such contamination may lead to the potential spread of bacteria and consequent severe health concerns. In this study, selenium nanoparticles were coated on normal paper towel surfaces through a quick precipitation method, introducing antibacterial properties to the paper towels in a healthy way. Their effectiveness at preventing biofilm formation was tested in bacterial assays involving Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The results showed significant and continuous bacteria inhibition with about a 90% reduction from 24 to 72 hours for gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The selenium coated paper towels also showed significant inhibition of gram-negative bacteria like P. aeruginosa and E. coli growth at about 57% and 84%, respectively, after 72 hours of treatment. Therefore, this study established a promising selenium-based antibacterial strategy to prevent bacterial growth on paper products, which may lead to the avoidance of bacteria spreading and consequent severe health concerns.
TI  - Challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma technology.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (MB) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, MB/light treatment and MB filtration. Virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. RESULTS: Leucocyte filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than 4 logs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of detection (LOD) (>/= 4.8 logs; Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae). MB/light and MB filtration further reduced Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to below the LOD. The small bacterium Brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the LOD by additional MB/light treatment and MB filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). Suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by THERAFLEX MB-Plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. CONCLUSION: THERAFLEX MB-Plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. Its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.
TI  - Quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various industrial applications. Despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. Here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (SFE) of bacterial cells. The adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Escherichia coli DH5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. We found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the SFE difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. The lower the SFE difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. We therefore propose the use of the SFE difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. The methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of metronidazole drug and selected counter-ions.
AB  - A series of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of the type [Ag(MTZ)2X] [MTZ = 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazole (metronidazole drug); X = NO3(-), ClO4(-), CF3COO(-), BF4(-) and CH3SO3(-)] was synthesised by the reactions of various Ag(i) salts with metronidazole (MTZ). All the complexes were characterized by ESI-MS spectrometry, solution NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Further evidence for the formation and molecular structure of all the complexes was provided by X-ray single-crystal crystallography. The different counter ions affect the crystal packing of the complexes and thus have an impact on the final geometries. The antimicrobial activities of the complexes against two Gram-positive strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, three Gram-negative strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Proteus hauseri ATCC 13315 and yeast Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were evaluated and compared with antibacterial and antifungal properties of appropriate silver salts, metronidazole and silver sulfadiazine drugs. The newly synthesized compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, better than the referenced silver sulfadiazine. The best active silver(i)-metronidazole complex contains a methanesulphonate counter-ion. Moreover, the complex inhibited the growth of yeast Candida albicans at a concentration 3-fold lower than that required for silver sulfadiazine. In addition, the complexes containing a tetrafluoroborate and a perchlorate as counter-ions were characterized as effective antibacterial agents against the tested Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Hydroxypropylcellulose as a novel green reservoir for the synthesis, stabilization, and storage of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Polysaccharides are attracting the vigil eye of researchers in order to design the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) of diverse size, shape, and application. We report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize Ag NPs where no physical reaction conditions were employed. Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was used as a template nanoreactor, stabilizer, and capping agent to obtain Ag NPs. Different concentrations of AgNO3 solutions (50 mmol, 75 mmol, and 100 mmol) were mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of HPC and the progress of the reaction was monitored by noting color changes of the reaction mixture at different reaction times for up to 24 hours. Characteristic ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) absorption bands of Ag NPs were observed in the range of 388-452 nm. The morphology of the Ag NPs was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy. The TEM images confirmed that the size of the Ag NPs was in the range of 25-55 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that the crystal phase of the Ag NPs was face-centered cubic. The as-prepared Ag NPs were found to be stable, and no changes in size and morphology were observed after storage in HPC thin films over 1 year, as indicated by UV/Vis spectra. So, the present work furnishes a green and economical strategy for the synthesis and storage of stable Ag NPs. As-synthesized Ag NPs showed significant antimicrobial activity against different bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal strains (Actinomycetes and Aspergillus niger).
TI  - A C-type lectin from Bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts Staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. Several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of Bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against S. aureus NRS155. Crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against S. aureus. Biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. Two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were also assayed against S. epidermidis NRS101. Fraction 15 was identified by TripleTOF mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding C-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kDa. The lectin was purified from the crude venom by D-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. This pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. The lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. The antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. A pre-formed S. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the C-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. chromogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Escherichia coli. These findings reveal a new activity for C-type lectins. Studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.
TI  - Multifunctional network-structured film coating for woven and knitted polyethylene terephthalate against cardiovascular graft-associated infections.
AB  - Multifunctional network-structured polymeric coat for woven and knitted forms of  crimped polyethylene terephthalate PET graft was developed to limit graft-associated infections. A newly synthesized antibacterial sulfadimethoxine polyhexylene adipate-b-methoxy polyethylene oxide (SD-PHA-b-MPEO) di-block copolymer was employed. Our figures of merit revealed that the formed coat showed a porous topographic architecture which manifested paramount properties, mostly bacterial anti-adhesion efficiency and biocompatibility with host cells. Compared to untreated grafts, the coat presented marked reduction of adhered Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis previously isolated from a patient's vein catheter by 2.6 and 2.3 folds for woven and knitted grafts, respectively. Similarly, bacterial anti-adhesion effect was observed for Staphylococcus aureus by 2.3 and 2.4 folds, and by 2.9 and 2.7 folds for Gram-negative Escherichia coli for woven and knitted grafts, respectively. Additionally, adhesion and growth characteristics of L929 cells on the modified grafts revealed no significant effect on the biocompatibility. In conclusion, coating of PET with (SD-PHA-b-MPEO) is a versatile approach offers the desired bacterial anti-adhesion effect and host biocompatibility.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as  FtsZ inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. The results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. Among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-MBA) against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-MBA but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of S. aureus ATCC29213. Particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/mL) against S. pyogenes PS, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-MBA, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. In addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of cell division against S. aureus ATCC25923, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial lubricant formulations containing poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates synthesized by tyrosinase.
AB  - Poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates were prepared using methylparaben as substrate of the oxidative enzyme tyrosinase. MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed that the enzymatic oxidation of methylparaben alone leads to the poly(hydroxybenzene) formation. In the presence of trimethoprim, the methylparaben tyrosinase oxidation leads poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates. All of these compounds were incorporated into lubricant hydroxyethyl cellulose/glycerol mixtures. Poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates were the most effective phenolic structures against the bacterial growth reducing by 96 and 97 % of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis suspensions, respectively (after 24 h). A novel enzymatic strategy to produce antimicrobial poly(hydroxybenzene)-antibiotic conjugates is proposed here for a wide range of applications on the biomedical field.
TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Bacterial growth rates are influenced by cellular characteristics of individual species when immersed in electromagnetic fields.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) have negative effects on the rate of growth of bacteria. In the present study, two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative species were exposed to six magnetic field conditions in broth cultures. Three variations of the 'Thomas' pulsed frequency-modulated pattern; a strong-static "puck" magnet upwards of 5000G in intensity; a pair of these magnets rotating opposite one another at approximately 30rpm; and finally a strong dynamic magnetic field generator termed the 'Resonator' with an average intensity of 250muT were used. Growth rate was discerned by optical density (OD) measurements every hour at 600nm. ELF-EMF conditions significantly affected the rates of growth of the bacterial cultures, while the two static magnetic field conditions were not statistically significant. Most interestingly, the 'Resonator' dynamic magnetic field increased the rates of growth of three species (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli), while slowing the growth of one (Serratia marcescens). We suggest that these effects are due to individual biophysical characteristics of the bacterial species.
TI  - Introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  - Peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. They are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. New implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. The aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-N-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (VP:DMMEP 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. With a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. In contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. These data confirm the hypothesis that VP:DMMEP 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.
TI  - Silver release and antimicrobial properties of PMMA films doped with silver ions, nano-particles and complexes.
AB  - Materials prepared on the base of bioactive silver compounds have become more and more popular due to low microbial resistance to silver. In the present work, the efficiency of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) thin films doped with silver ions, nanoparticles and silver-imidazole polymer complex was studied by a combination of AAS, XPS and AFM techniques. The biological activities of the proposed materials were discussed in view of the rate of silver releasing from the polymer matrix. Concentrations of Ag active form were estimated by its ability to interact with l-cysteine using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Rates of the released silver were compared with the biological activity in dependence on the form of embedded silver. Antimicrobial properties of doped polymer films were studied using two bacterial strains: Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. It was found that PMMA films doped with Ag(+) had greater activity than those doped with nanoparticles and silver-imidazole polymeric complexes. However, the antimicrobial efficiency of Ag(+) doped films was only short-term. Contrary, the antimicrobial activity of silver-imidazole/PMMA films increased in time of sample soaking.
TI  - Recombinant production and evaluation of an antibacterial L-amino acid oxidase derived from flounder Platichthys stellatus.
AB  - Fish produce mucus substances as a defensive outer barrier against several bacterial infections. We have recently identified an antibacterial L-amino acid oxidase (psLAAO1) in the mucus layer of the flounder Platichthys stellate. In this study, the antibacterial protein psLAAO1 was expressed as a secretory bioactive recombinant protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant psLAAO1 inhibited the growth of bacteria to the same levels as native psLAAO1 present in mucus. In particular, Staphylococci and Yersinia were strongly suppressed, showing the highest growth retardation of the 21 species and strains tested. Moreover, Staphylococcus epidermidis was most sensitive to psLAAO1 with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.078 mug/mL, whereas Escherichia coli was essentially resistant to psLAAO1 with a MIC of >10 mug/mL. Interestingly, psLAAO1-treated E. coli were found to upregulate the expression of the btuE gene, which encodes glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The biochemical function of GPx is to reduce free hydrogen peroxide and is induced under response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, E. coli confers resistance to the reduced free hydrogen peroxide produced by psLAAO1 by increasing GPx levels. Furthermore, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus was completely inhibited in the presence of recombinant psLAAO1. The morphology of psLAAO1-treated S. aureus showed cell surface damage, the formation of large aggregates and the cells showed severe deformations. Western blot analysis showed that psLAAO1 binds to the surface of S. aureus. Therefore, psLAAO1 binds to the surface of LAAO-sensitive S. aureus and directs peroxidative activity at the surface of the bacterial membrane.
TI  - Compounds from Geijera parviflora with prostaglandin E2 inhibitory activity may explain its traditional use for pain relief.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Australian Aboriginal people used crushed leaves  of Geijera parviflora Lindl. both internally and externally for pain relief, including for toothache (Cribb and Cribb, 1981). This study tested the hypothesis that this traditional use might be at least in part explained by the presence of compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A crude extract (95% EtOH) was prepared from powdered dried leaves. From the CH3Cl fraction of this extract compounds were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation and tested for: (1) cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 murine leukemic monocyte-macrophages, (2) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibitory activity in 3T3 Swiss albino mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, as well as (3) nitric oxide (NO) and (4) tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Isolated compounds were also tested for (5) antibacterial activity against a panel of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984, biofilm-forming) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) strains by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Eleven compounds were isolated, including one new flavone and one new natural product, with a further four compounds reported from this species for the first time. Some of the compounds showed good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. In particular, flindersine (1) and N-(acetoxymethyl) flindersine (3) inhibited PGE2 release with IC50 values of 5.0muM and 4.9muM, respectively, without any significant cytotoxicity. Several other compounds showed moderate inhibition of NO (5, 6, 7) and TNF-alpha (6), with IC50 in the low micromolar range; however much of this apparent activity could be accounted for by the cytotoxicity of these compounds. None of the compounds showed anti-bacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of PGE2, an important mediator of inflammation and pain, by flindersine and a derivative thereof, along with the moderate anti-inflammatory activity shown by several other compounds isolated from Geijera parviflora leaf extract, support the traditional use of this plant for pain relief by Australian Aboriginal people.
TI  - Microbiology of Pelvic Lymphocyst Infection after Lymphadenectomy for Malignant Gynecologic Tumors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. Although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. The purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between October 2002 and March 2013. The participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. Computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors, and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. Cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), S. epidermidis (one patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), Enterococcus (two patients), Escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). They were all monomicrobial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and other smaller ones suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. These bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of antioxidant, total phenol and flavonoid content and antimicrobial activities of Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) of underutilized tropical fruit extracts.
AB  - Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) pulp, peel and whole fruit were extracted with various solvents such as hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol. The antioxidant activity of these extracts were examined using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test. IC50 was 55 +/- 5.89 mug/ml for the pulp part of methanol extract. In the beta-carotene bleaching assay, the antioxidant activity was 90.02 +/- 1.51 % for the positive control (Trolox) and 88.34 +/- 1.31 % for the pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The total phenolic content of the crude extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; methanol pulp part demonstrated the highest phenol content value of 781 +/- 52.97 mg GAE/g of dry sample. While the total flavonoid content was determined using the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay, the highest value of 6213.33 +/- 142.22 mg QE/g was indicated by pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts was tested using disc diffusion method against pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida albicans. Methanol extract of pulp part was recorded to have the highest zone of inhibition against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBC/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) for the extracts were also determined using the microdilution method ranging from 4000 to 63 mug/ml against pathogenic microbes. The MBC/MFC values varied from 250 to 4000 mug/ml. A correlation between antioxidant activity assays, antimicrobial activity and phenolic content was established. The results shows that the various parts of A. altilis fruit extracts promising antioxidant activities have potential bioactivities due to high content of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein and Peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in the neonatal period. STUDY DESIGN: Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. Concentrations of lactoferrin, LL-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of AMPs. Samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent LOS were compared for levels of AMPs and inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Levels of most AMPs and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. Lactoferrin was the only AMP that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. Levels of AMPs were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without LOS, however, infants who developed LOS consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk AMPs than those who were free from LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of lactoferrin and defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.
TI  - Fluids for continuous renal replacement therapy--an evaluation of microbial integrity.
AB  - PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated widespread microbial contamination in the dialysis and replacement fluid circuits of bicarbonate-buffered, continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs). It is not known whether different CRRT fluids have an impact on bacterial activity. METHODS: In this study the in vitro growth and biofilm formation associated with seven strains of bacteria (Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in five CRRT fluids (Prismocitrate, Monosol S, Accusol 35, tri-sodium citrate and Ci-Ca K2) were studied. The fluids were each inoculated with light and heavy concentrations of each of the bacterial strains and incubated at 22 or 37 degrees C for up to 72 h with and without bacterial growth medium. Bacterial growth was assessed by spectrophotometry. Biofilm formation was assessed by a standard microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: Unsupplemented fluids did not support bacterial growth or biofilm formation after 72 h incubation. When supplemented with bacterial growth medium, some fluids, in particular Accusol 35, Ci-Ca K2, and tri-sodium citrate, had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth, although none suppressed growths across the panel of tested organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Different CRRT fluids have different impacts on bacterial growth and biofilm formation, but all remain susceptible to extrinsic contamination.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in Brazil.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different Brazilian cities (Sorocaba and Rio Branco). A control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. The diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dL. Patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels >126 mg/dL. The samples obtained were inoculated in Brain-Heart Infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. The percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). There was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. There was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. In Sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in Rio Branco. The microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: There was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. The microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
TI  - Introducing Urtica dioica, A Native Plant of Khuzestan, As an Antibacterial Medicinal Plant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urtica dioica is a flowering plant with long history of use in folk medicine and as a food source. OBJECTIVES: This study examined in vitro antibacterial potential of alcoholic extracts of U. dioica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extracts from aerial parts were prepared using aqueous solution of ethanol and methanol and their inhibitory effects against clinical isolates was examined by disc diffusion method at different doses. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) indexes were also investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed to find structural changes of affected bacteria consequent to exposing with extracts. RESULTS: Both extracts were active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli with respectively 16, 10, 18, and 14 mm (methanolic) and 11, 9, 17, and 16 mm (ethanolic) inhibition zone. The MIC of ethanolic extract against S. epidermidis and E. coli was respectively 10 and 40 mg/mL. The MIC of methanolic extract against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was 40 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The MBC was found only for S. epidermidis (20 mg/mL). In SEM analysis the round shape of S. epidermidis was changed and irregular shapes were appeared, which suggest that the main target of these extracts was cell wall. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts of U. dioica showed significant antibacterial effect against some clinically important pathogenic bacteria. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that U. dioica is useful as antibacterial and bactericidal agent in treating infectious diseases.
TI  - Sunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nanotechnology is now regarded as a distinct field of research in modern science and technology with multifaceted areas including biomedical applications. Among the various approaches currently available for the generation of metallic nanoparticles, biogenic synthesis is of increasing demand for the purpose of green nanotechnology. Among various natural sources, plant materials are the most readily available template-directing matrix offering cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and easy handling. Moreover, the inherent pharmacological potentials of these medicinal plant extracts offer added biomedical implementations of the synthesized metal nanoparticles. RESULTS: A robust practical method for eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) as both reducing and capping agent, under the influence of direct sunlight has been developed without applying any other chemical additives. The nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited considerable antibacterial activity. The effects were more pronounced on non-endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes than endospore-forming species Bacillus subtilis. The nanoparticles also showed prominent activity on Gram-negative human pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plant pathogenic Pantoea ananatis. A bactericidal mode of action was observed for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the nanoparticles. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a very simple, efficient, and practical method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of O. sanctum under the influence of direct sunlight. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles making use of such a traditionally important medicinal plant without applying any other chemical additives, thus offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign route for their large-scale commercial production. The nanoparticles dispersed in the mother solution showed promising antibacterial efficacy. Graphical AbstractSunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum Linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
TI  - Corneal epithelial wound healing and bactericidal effect of conditioned medium from human uterine cervical stem cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of conditioned medium from human uterine cervical stem cells (CM-hUCESCs) on corneal epithelial healing in a rat model of dry eye after alkaline corneal epithelial ulcer. We also tested the bactericidal effect of CM-hUCESCs. METHODS: Dry eye was induced in rats by extraocular lacrimal gland excision, and corneal ulcers were produced using NaOH. Corneal histologic evaluation was made with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We also studied the bactericidal effect of CM-hUCESCs in vitro and on infected corneal contact lenses (CLs) using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria. In addition, in order to investigate proteins from CM-hUCESCs that could mediate these effects, we carried out a human cytokine antibody array. RESULTS: After injury, dry eyes treated with CM-hUCESCs significantly improved epithelial regeneration and showed reduced corneal macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) and TNF-alpha mRNA expression as compared to untreated eyes and eyes treated with culture medium or sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic drops. In addition, we found in CM-hUCESCs high levels of proteins, such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2, fibroblast growth factor 6 and 7, urokinase receptor, and hepatocyte growth factor, that could mediate these effects. In vitro, CM-hUCESCs showed a clear bactericidal effect on both E. coli and S. epidermidis and CLs infected with S. epidermidis. Analyses of CM-hUCESCs showed elevated levels of proteins that could be involved in the bactericidal effect, such as the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands 1, 6, 8, 10, and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 5 and 20. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with CM-hUCESCs improved wound healing of alkali-injured corneas and showed a strong bactericidal effect on CLs. Patients using CLs and suffering from dry eye, allergies induced by commercial solutions, or small corneal injuries could benefit from this treatment.
TI  - Counterion-activated nanoactuator: reversibly switchable killing/releasing bacteria on polycation brushes.
AB  - A strategy to release attached bacteria from surface-grafted bactericidal poly((trimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate chloride) (pTMAEMA) brushes has been proposed. The pTMAEMA brushes were fabricated via the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization for contact killing of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The bacteria-conditioning surfaces, afterward, were washed with electrolyte solutions containing anions with different lipophilic characteristic, charge density, polarity and adsorbility to quaternary ammonium groups in polymers. Because of the special ion-pairing interactions, the interfacial properties, including wettability and zeta-potential, can be manipulated in a controlled manner. Therefore, the counterion-assisted modulation of pTMAEMA brushes facilitates the bacterial release and regeneration of antimicrobial polymer films. The physicochemical properties of polymer brushes and their interactions with counterions were characterized using an ellipsometer, contact angle goniometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and an electrokinetic analyzer. The repetitive killing and releasing actions of pTMAEMA through unlocking and locking counterions were demonstrated, showing the robust effectiveness of the pTMAEMA-based nanoactuator in controlling the physical action by the chemical stimuli. The real-world implementation of the nanoactuator was demonstrated with a surgical scalpel by repelling killed bacteria and retaining reusability.
TI  - Synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide amphiphiles for treatment of fungal keratitis.
AB  - Fungal keratitis is a leading cause of ocular morbidity. It is frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial keratitis, causing a delay in proper treatment. Furthermore, due to the lack of safe and effective anti-fungal agents for clinical use, treatment of fugal keratitis remains a challenge. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received considerable attention as potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents with the potential to overcome antibiotics resistance. We previously reported the design of short synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides (IKIK)2-NH2 and (IRIK)2-NH2 with excellent antimicrobial activities and selectivities against various clinically relevant microorganisms, including Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeast Candida albicans (C. albicans). In this study, we evaluated the application of the two most promising synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide candidates for in vivo fungal keratitis treatment in comparison with the commercially available amphotericin B. It was found that topical solutions of the designed peptides are safe, and as effective as the clinically used amphotericin B. Compared to the costly and unstable amphotericin B, (IKIK)2-NH2 and (IRIK)2-NH2 are water-soluble, less expensive and stable. Thus, the synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides are presented as promising candidates for the treatment of fungal keratitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial and bacteria-releasing multifunctional surfaces: oligo (p-phenylene-ethynylene)/poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) films deposited by RIR-MAPLE.
AB  - Antimicrobial oligo (p-phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) films have previously been demonstrated to show effective ultraviolet A (UVA) light-induced biocidal activity; however, a serious problem arises from the accumulation of dead bacteria and debris on the films that limits their effectiveness and application. In this work, we address this challenge by incorporating thermally-responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), which provides on-demand bacteria-releasing functionality. Multifunctional surfaces comprising blended films of OPE and PNIPAAm were deposited on substrates by resonant infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) using a sequential co-deposition mode. In this way, RIR-MAPLE enabled the deposition of multifunctional films with surface properties and film functionality that can be tailored, precisely and systematically, by controlling the chemical composition of the deposited film. The surface properties of these films were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and water contact angle measurements. The interactions between bacteria and the deposited films were tested using two model bacteria: Escherichia coli K12 (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive). The antimicrobial and bacteria-release properties of the blended films were controlled by varying the OPE/PNIPAAm ratio in the RIR-MAPLE emulsion target, providing an easy way to optimize the multifunctional surface. The OPE/PNIPAAm blended films with optimized composition killed a majority of attached E. coli bacteria at 37 degrees C and under UVA exposure, and the dead bacteria were then removed from the films simply by rinsing with water at 25 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro comparison of biological and synthetic materials for skeletal chest wall reconstruction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various biological and synthetic materials have been proposed for use in skeletal chest wall reconstruction (SCWR). Because of the lack of studies allowing a direct comparison of SCWR materials, their clinical use often depends on the surgeon's preference and experience. The aim of this study was to analyze 6 synthetic and 3 biological materials frequently used in SCWR with respect to their cytotoxicity, bacterial adhesion, surface characteristics, and mechanical properties to facilitate data-driven decisions. METHODS: The effect of the SCWR materials and their extracts on the metabolism of human skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs), dermal fibroblasts, adipose cells, and osteoblasts was analyzed in vitro. Bacterial adhesion was quantified by incubating samples in bacterial suspensions (Staphylococcus epidermidis, S aureus, and Escherichia coli), followed by counting colony-forming units and performing scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the materials were analyzed under uniaxial tensile loading to failure. RESULTS: The metabolism of all cell types seeded on the SCWR materials was reduced compared with untreated cells. With the exception of Vypro (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ), whose extracts significantly reduced fibroblast viability, no cytotoxic leachable substances were detected. Biological materials were less cytotoxic compared with synthetic ones, but they demonstrated increased bacterial adhesion. Synthetic materials demonstrated higher elongation to failure than did biological materials. CONCLUSIONS: Biological and synthetic SCWR materials showed significant differences in their cytotoxicity, bacterial adhesion, and biomechanical properties, suggesting that they may be used for different indications in SCWR. Further comparable in vivo studies are needed to analyze their performance in different indications of clinical application.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo characterization of antibacterial activity and biocompatibility: a study on silver-containing phosphonate monolayers on titanium.
AB  - Infections associated with implanted medical devices are a major cause of nosocomial infections, with serious medical and economic repercussions. A variety of silver-containing coatings have been proposed to decrease the risk of infection by hindering bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. However, the therapeutic range of silver is relatively narrow and it is important to minimize the amount of silver in the coatings, in order to keep sufficient antibacterial activity without inducing cytotoxicity. In this study, the antibacterial efficiency and biocompatibility of nanocoatings with minimal silver loading ( approximately 0.65 nmol cm(-2)) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Titanium substrates were coated by grafting mercaptododecylphosphonic acid (MDPA) monolayers followed by post-reaction with AgNO3. The MDPA/AgNO3 nanocoatings significantly inhibited Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro, while allowing attachment and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 cells and murine mesenchymal stem cells was not affected by the nanocoatings. Sterilization by ethylene oxide did not alter the antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of the nanocoatings. After subcutaneous implantation of the materials in mice, we demonstrated that MDPA/AgNO3 nanocoatings exhibit significant antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility, both in vitro and in vivo, after postoperative seeding with S. epidermidis. These results confirm the interest of coating strategies involving subnanomolar amounts of silver exposed at the extreme surface for preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on metallic or ceramic medical devices without compromising their biocompatibility.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial evaluation of the essential oils of Bocageopsis pleiosperma Maas.
AB  - Essential oils from the leaves, twigs and barks of Bocageopsis pleiosperma Maas were obtained by using hydrodistillation and analysed by using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Several compounds (51) were detected and identified, being beta-bisabolene the main component in all aerial parts of the plant, with higher concentration in the leaves (55.77%), followed by barks (38.53%) and twigs (34.37%). In order to increase the biological knowledge about the essential oil of Bocageopsis species, antimicrobial activities were evaluated against the microorganisms Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida tropicalis, Candida dubliniensis, Candida glabrata and Candida albicans. The essential oil obtained from the barks exhibited a moderate effect against S. epidermidis ATCC 1228 (MIC = 250 mug/mL), while the other oils did not exhibit antimicrobial activity. These results represent the first report about the chemical composition of B. pleiosperma and the first antimicrobial evaluation with a Bocageopsis species.
TI  - Changes in Caenorhabditis elegans immunity and Staphylococcal virulence factors during their interactions.
AB  - The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is used as a model system for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is one of the major virulent and immunostimulatory components found in gram positive bacteria. The current study used LTA isolated from Staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic and non-pathogenic Staphylococcus epidermidis. The overall physiological assays revealed that LTA exposed C. elegans show a significant reduction in the life span, production of eggs and progenies. To understand the involvement of innate immune specific players at the mRNA level, the regulation of few candidate antimicrobial genes was studied during Staphylococcal LTA exposures. qPCR analysis indicated an upregulation of antimicrobial peptides during LTA exposures. To understand the involvement of LTA and other virulent genes during infection, the regulation of LTA synthase and a few virulence genes was monitored during host exposure. The qPCR analyses indicated the upregulation of ltaS and other virulence genes (atoxin, sak, ssaA and fbe) during infection. Ability of the pathogens to modify their internal machinery during host presence was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltametric analyses. The FTIR results indicated distinct alterations of peaks from Staphylococcal LTA composition between control and the host exposed. Further, EIS and CV data displayed clear differences between the host exposed Staphylococcal samples compared to their respective unexposed controls. The pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains showed different types of regulations and interactions during host exposures. The observed modifications clearly suggest that the Gram positive pathogen changes its LTA production and possibly the structure to cause a severe pathogenic effect on an interacting host.
TI  - Antimicrobial and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation of constituents isolated from Polygonatumverticillatum rhizomes.
AB  - This study was designed to assess the susceptibility of various microorganisms and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation against diosgenin and santonin, isolated from Polygonatum verticillatum rhizomes. Both diosgenin and santonin showed significant zone of inhibition when studied against various Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). In antifungal assay, only santonin exhibited profound sensitivity against various fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma harzianum and Fusarium oxysporum) used in the test. Both diosgenin and santonin also exhibited marked attenuation on heat-induced protein denaturation in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values of 375 and 310 mug/mL, respectively. In conclusion, both the isolated compounds have antimicrobial potential supported by strong inhibition on protein denaturation and thus support the antimicrobial uses of plant in traditional system of treatment.
TI  - Short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of Citrus sinensis.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of Citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcesnces, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter amnigenus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia odorifera. Methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. In vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. It was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of C. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of S. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). The potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. The order of antioxidant activity through ABTS.+ and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. Phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. It was also found that Chloroform/Methanol (5:5) and Butanol/Ethanol/Water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. These findings reveal the potential use of C. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial analysis of aqueous humor after topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous humor in patients who had preoperative topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Twenty-nine eyes from 29 cataract surgery patients were included in this study. In the study group (n = 15 eyes), 3 topical applications of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% were administered preoperatively; in the control group (n = 14 eyes), no topical applications were administered. Aqueous humor samples were collected and stored in sterile microtubes at -80 degrees C until analysis. Antimicrobial analysis was performed using standard strains with standard sterile filter paper disks. Inhibition halos were measured in millimeters, and both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Inhibition halos were observed on most of the study group plates except those with Streptococcus pneumoniae: Escherichia coli (13.93 mm +/- 0.64 [SD]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.63 +/- 0.61 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (7.47 +/- 0.68 mm), and S epidermidis (4.20 +/- 3.33 mm) The differences between the mean inhibition halo diameters were statistically significant (P < .0001) in all samples. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: After topical application of moxifloxacin 0.5%, aqueous humor showed bacteriostatic effect against E coli, K pneumoniae, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms evaluated. No antimicrobial effect against S pneumoniae was observed.

TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  - A new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. This system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. The method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils than are traditional methods. Such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. A bacterial strain, T515(T), was isolated using this modified culture method. Growth of strain T515(T) occurred at pH 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl on R2A agar. Colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees C. Comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain T515(T) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus Bacillus, and strain T515(T) was most closely related to Bacillus panaciterrae Gsoil 1517(T) (96.7 %) and Bacillus funiculus NAF001(T) (96.0 %). The major quinone of strain T515(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (23.2 %) and C16 : 0 (10.9 %). The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Strain T515(T) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). The strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: Bacillus subtilis KEMB 51201-001, Staphylococcus aureus KEMB 4659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KACC 10185, Staphylococcus epidermidis KACC 13234, Paenibacillus larvae KACC 14031 and Escherichia coli KEMB 212-234. Based on these results, strain T515(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus with the proposed name, Bacillus polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T515(T) ( = KEMB 9005-168(T) = KACC 18242(T) = NBRC 110614(T)).
TI  - Viability of 3h grown bacterial micro-colonies after direct Raman identification.
AB  - Clinical diagnostics in routine microbiology still mostly relies on bacterial growth, a time-consuming process that prevents test results to be used directly as key decision-making elements for therapeutic decisions. There is some evidence that Raman micro-spectroscopy provides clinically relevant information from a limited amount of bacterial cells, thus holding the promise of reduced growth times and accelerated result delivery. Indeed, bacterial identification at the species level directly from micro-colonies at an early time of growth (6h) directly on their growth medium has been demonstrated. However, such analysis is suspected to be partly destructive and could prevent the further growth of the colony needed for other tests, e.g. antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the powerful laser excitation used for Raman identification on micro-colonies probed after very short growth times. We show here, using envelope integrity markers (Syto 9 and Propidium Iodide) directly on ultra-small micro-colonies of a few tens of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells (3h growth time), that only the cells that are directly impacted by the laser lose their membrane integrity. Growth kinetics experiments show that the non-probed surrounding cells are sometimes also affected but that the micro-colonies keep their ability to grow, resulting in normal aspect and size of colonies after 15h of growth. Thus, Raman spectroscopy could be used for very early (<3h) identification of grown micro-organisms without impairing further antibiotics susceptibility characterization steps.
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Importance of Tryptophan in Transforming an Amphipathic Peptide into a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Targeted Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Here, we found that simple substitution of amino acids in the middle position of  the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic peptide RI16 with tryptophan (T9W) considerably transformed into an antimicrobial peptide specifically targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) results demonstrated that T9W had a strong and specifically antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, including antibiotic-resistant strains, but was not active against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphyfococcus epidermidis. Fluorescent spectroscopic assays indicated that T9W interacted with the membrane of P. aeruginosa, depolarizing the outer and the inner membrane of bacterial cells. Salt susceptibility assay showed that T9W still maintained its strong anti-pseudomonas activity in the presence of salts at physiological concentrations, and in hemolytic and MTT assays T9W also showed no toxicity against human blood cells and macrophages. In vivo assay demonstrated that T9W also displayed no toxicity to Chinese Kun Ming (KM) mice. Furthermore, the strong antibiofilm activity was also observed with the peptide T9W, which decreased the percentage of biomass formation in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these findings indicated that design of single-pathogen antimicrobial agents can be achieved by simple amino acid mutation in naturally occurring peptide sequences and this study suggested a model of optimization/design of anti-pseudomonas drugs in which the tryptophan residue was a conserved element.
TI  - Physicochemical and biological properties of oxovanadium(IV), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes with oxydiacetate anions.
AB  - The potentiometric and conductometric titration methods have been used to characterize the stability of series of VO(IV)-, Co(II)- and Ni(II)-oxydiacetato complexes in DMSO-water solutions containing 0-50 % (v/v) DMSO. The influence of DMSO as a co-solvent on the stability of the complexes as well as the oxydiacetic acid was evaluated. Furthermore, the reactivity of the complexes towards superoxide free radicals was assessed by employing the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. The biological properties of the complexes were investigated in relation to their cytoprotective activity against the oxidative damage generated exogenously by using hydrogen peroxide in the Human Dermal Fibroblasts adult (HDFa) cell line as well as to their antimicrobial activity against the bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis). The relationship between physicochemical and biological properties of the complexes was discussed.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from flower, leaf and stem of Ferula cupularis growing wild in Iran.
AB  - CONTEXT: Ferula cupularis (Boiss.) Spalik et S. R. Downie (Apiaceae) is a common  plant in Iran that grows in the foothills of Dena Mountain. In traditional folk medicine, this plant has different applications, but there are no studies proving their uses. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first attempt to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial effect of the essential oils of F. cupularis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oils from flower, leaf, and stem of F. cupularis were analyzed by using GC and GC-MS. Antibacterial activity of essential oils was determined by microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The essential oil from flower of F. cupularis contained 15 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, and 2 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The leaf essential oil contained 12 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and 3 non-terpenoid components. Stem essential oil contained one monoterpene, 23 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, and 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The MIC value of stem essential oil was 2.85 mg/mL against both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa which was inhibited at 22.75 mg/mL. The MIC values of leaf and flower essential oils were higher than 5.69 and 22.75 mg/mL, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study highlighted the strong antibacterial effect of Ferula cupularis's essential oil which might be due to its high content of oxygenated monoterpene hydrocarbons. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that this plant may be a good candidate for further biological and pharmacological investigations.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the non-volatile phenolic fraction from rosemary leaves.
AB  - In this study, the aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial action of the non-volatile phenols of rosemary leaves against two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Three extracts with different phenolic compositions were tested. By the agar disc diffusion method, Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the extracts, and S. epidermidis showed the highest inhibition zones. Overall, all the extracts tested by the broth dilution method showed higher activity than results from the agar disc diffusion method. The minimal bactericidal concentration values indicated that E. coli was the most susceptible strain. This study demonstrated that the flavonoidic fraction of rosemary leaves does not play a crucial role as antimicrobial agents against these microorganisms. The most active extract was characterised by the highest amount of non-volatile terpenoidic compounds.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. We therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the N-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (MIC = 18.5 mug mL(-)(1)). This compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa. Importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.
TI  - Anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1Pb and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa.
AB  - Pseudhymenochirin-1Pb (Ps-1Pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa (Ps-2Pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog Pseudhymenochirus merlini (Pipidae). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa are highly cytotoxic (LC50<12 muM) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (LC50=28+/-2 muM for Ps-1Pb and LC50=6+/-1 muM for Ps-2Pa). Ps-2Pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (LC50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (HUVEC) cells=68+/-2 muM). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa (5 mug/mL) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the multifunctional cytokine IL-6 from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice and enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 from both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Ps-1Pb potently (MIC</=10 muM) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Ps-2Pa shows the same high potency (MIC</=10 muM) against the Gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the Gram-negative isolates. Ps-1Pb at 4xMIC kills 99.9% of Escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of S. aureus within 180 min. In conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Co-infection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli in bovine mastitis--three cases reported from India.
AB  - Emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bovine mastitis pathogens is the major cause of frequent therapeutic failure and a cause of concern for veterinary practitioners. This study describes intra-mammary infection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli in two Holstein Friesian crossbred cows with subclinical mastitis and one non-descript cow with clinical mastitis in two different districts of West Bengal, India. In total, three MRSE, one MRSA and three ESBL producing E. coli were isolated from these cases. Both the crossbreds were detected with MRSE (HFSE1 and HFSE2) and ESBL producing E. coli (HFEC1 and HFEC2), whereas, simultaneous infection of three pathogens viz. MRSA (NDSA1), MRSE (NDSE1) and ESBL producing E. coli (NDEC1) was found in the non-descript cow. The methicillin-resistant isolates possessed mecA gene and exhibited resistance to various antibiotics such as amikacin, tetracycline and glycopeptides. The ESBL producers were positive for blaCTX-M and blaTEM genes; in addition, HFEC1 and HFEC2 were positive for blaSHV and possessed the genes for class I integron (int1), sulphonamide resistance (sul1), quinolone resistance (qnrS) and other virulence factors (papC, iucD and ESTA1). All the ESBL producers exhibited resistance to a variety of antibiotics tested including third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and were also intermediately resistant to carbapenems. This is the first ever report on simultaneous occurrence of MRSE, MRSA and ESBL producing E. coli in bovine mastitis indicating a major concern for dairy industry and public health as well.
TI  - Defensins from the tick Ixodes scapularis are effective against phytopathogenic fungi and the human bacterial pathogen Listeria grayi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodes scapularis is the most common tick species in North America and a vector of important pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Tick defensins have been identified as a new source of antimicrobial agents with putative medical applications due to their wide-ranging antimicrobial activities. Two multigene families of defensins were previously reported in I. scapularis. The objective of the present study was to characterise the potential antimicrobial activity of two defensins from I. scapularis with emphasis on human pathogenic bacterial strains and important phytopathogenic fungi. METHODS: Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 mature peptides were chemically synthesised. In vitro antimicrobial assays were performed to test the activity of these two defensins against species of different bacterial genera including Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria spp. as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa along with two plant-pathogenic fungi from the genus Fusarium. In addition, the tissue-specific expression patterns of Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 in I. scapularis midgut, salivary glands and embryo-derived cell lines were determined using PCR. Finally, tertiary structures of the two defensins were predicted and structural analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Scapularisin-6 efficiently killed L. grayi, and both Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 caused strong inhibition (IC50 value: ~1 muM) of the germination of plant-pathogenic fungi Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium graminearum. Scapularisin-6 gene expression was observed in I. scapularis salivary glands and midgut. However, Scapularisin-3 gene expression was only detected in the salivary glands. Transcripts from the two defensins were not found in the I. scapularis tick cell lines ISE6 and ISE18. CONCLUSION: Our results have two main implications. Firstly, the anti-Listeria and antifungal activities of Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 suggest that these peptides may be useful for (i) treatment of antibiotic-resistant L. grayi in humans and (ii) plant protection. Secondly, the antimicrobial properties of the two defensins described in this study may pave the way for further studies regarding pathogen invasion and innate immunity in I. scapularis.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. They are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from January 2010 to May 2013. RESULTS: In total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. Gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. Pathogens according to their frequency were the following Escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), Klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), Acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). The first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. Positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. All recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. Immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was initiated. Acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dL from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. CONCLUSION: Increased prevalence of bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. The commonest pathogens are Gram negative bacteria with E. coli the most frequent. Early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.
TI  - Essential oil of Eucalyptus gunnii hook. As a novel source of antioxidant, antimutagenic and antibacterial agents.
AB  - The present study describes radical scavenging capacity (RSC), antimutagenic and  antibacterial properties of the essential oil (EO) of the leaves of Eucalyptus gunnii Hook. (Southern Montenegro). Chemical composition was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In oil, 1,8-cineole (67.8%) and alpha-pinene (14.12%) were the major compounds comprising almost 82% of total EO. EO exhibited moderate DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity, with IC50 value of 7.19 microL/mL. The antimutagenic properties were assayed against the spontaneous and t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli IC202 oxyR mutant strain, deficient in removing radical oxygen species (ROS). Reduction of the spontaneous mutagenesis in the presence of E. gunnii EO was only slight, up to 12% at the highest concentration tested. However, when the oxidative mutagen was used, EO displayed more significant reduction of mutagenesis (maximum 23%) in a concentration dependent manner. Antibacterial activity was tested against the selected strains from ATTC and NCIB collections: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the two Escherichia coli strains from our laboratory collection (SY252 and IB112) using both the disk-diffusion and MIC assays. The greatest sensitivity was shown by M. flavus, K. pneumoniae and E. coli lpcA (MIC = 0.83 mg/mL), while the highest resistance was shown by E. coli (ATTC 25922) and S. epidermidis. This study represents the first report on chemical composition and biological activity of the Eucalyptus gunnii in the South Balkan region and beyond.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in pediatric hematology/oncology patients after anticancer chemotherapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology and oncology represent a  major problem worldwide, but this has not been studied in Qatar. In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar. METHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (>/=5 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.
TI  - Infectious Keratitis Following Corneal Crosslinking: A Systematic Review of Reported Cases: Management, Visual Outcome, and Treatment Proposed.
AB  - Abstract Aim: To describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. Methods: A Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) search from October 2000 to October 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. Nineteen articles were selected. Ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. Nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in German, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. Results: A total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. The infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus S. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (E. coli; P. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (Fusarium and Microsporidia) (20%), and Acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). Conclusions: Only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. The most virulent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acanthamoeba. Less virulent organisms were Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. The most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.
TI  - Three-year study of health care-associated infections in a Turkish pediatric ward.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) can cause an increase in  morbidity, mortality and costs, especially in developing countries. As information on the epidemiology of HCAIs in pediatric patientsinTurkey is limited, we decided to study the annual incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns in our pediatric ward at Marmara University Hospital. METHODOLOGY: All hospitalized patients in the pediatric ward were assessed with regard to HCAIs between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Data was prospectively collected according to standard protocols of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NosoLINE). RESULTS: A total of 16.5% of all hospitalized patients developed HCAIs in the three years studied. The most frequent HCAIs were urinary tract infections (UTI) (29.3%), bloodstream infections (27%) and pneumonias (21%). While the most frequent agent isolatedfrom UTI was Escherichia coli (26%), the most common agent in blood stream infections was Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.4%). Vancomycin resistance was found in 73.3% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was detected in 58.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Continual HCAI surveillance is important to determineits rate. Knowledge of the HCAI incidence can influence people's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and encourage antibiotic rotation. Moreover, the knowledge of HCAI incidence may support the infection control programmes, including education and isolation methods which ultimately may help to reducethe rate of the HCAIs.
TI  - Tetracycline tethered to titanium inhibits colonization by Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - As peri-prosthetic infection is one of the most devastating complications associated with implant placement, we have reasoned that such infection can be largely subverted by development of antibacterial implants. Our previous work demonstrated that covalent coupling of vancomycin to titanium alloy prevented colonization by the Gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some orthopedic devices, including permanent prosthesis anchors, and most dental implants are transcutaneous or transmucosal and can be prone to colonization by Gram-negative pathogens. We report here the successful covalent coupling of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, tetracycline (TET), to titanium surfaces (Ti-TET) to retard Gram-negative colonization. Synthetic progress was followed by changes in water contact angle, while the presence of TET was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Ti-TET actively prevented colonization in the presence of bathing Escherichia coli, both by fluorescence microscopy and direct counting. Finally, the Ti-TET surface supported osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation over a 72-h period. Thus, this new surface offers a powerful means to protect transcutaneous implants from adhesion of Gram-negative pathogens, decreasing the need for replacement of this hardware.

TI  - Do crosslinking and vitamin E stabilization influence microbial adhesions on UHMWPE-based biomaterials?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microorganism adhesion on polyethylene for total joint arthroplasty is a concern. Many studies have focused on vitamin E-stabilized ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), whereas first-generation, highly crosslinked UHMWPE, which is the most commonly used in clinical practice, has been scarcely evaluated. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We aimed (1) to compare the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans with virgin (untreated) UHMWPE (PE) and crosslinked UHMWPE (XLPE); (2) to correlate the results with the biomaterial surface properties; and (3) to determine whether the decreased adhesion on vitamin E-stabilized UHMWPE (VE-PE) previously recorded for bacteria can also be confirmed for C albicans. METHODS: Microbial adhesion of biofilm-producing American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and clinical strains on XLPE and VE-PE were compared with PE at 3, 7, 24, and 48 hours of incubation and quantified, as colony forming units (CFU)/mL, using a sonication protocol. Sample surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, roughness and contact angle measurements, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to reveal qualitative differences in surface composition and topography that could influence the microbial adhesion. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics and tested by unpaired t-tests. RESULTS: All microorganisms, both ATCC and clinical strains, showed lower adhesion (p < 0.05) on XLPE with adhesion percentages ranging from 18% to 25%, compared with PE with adhesion percentages ranging from 51% to 55%, after 48 hours. Only the ATCC S epidermidis showed a reduced adhesion profile even at 3 hours (adhesion ratio of 14% on XLPE versus 50% on PE) and 24 hours (19% on XLPE versus 55% on PE) of incubation. ATCC and clinical C albicans were less adherent to XLPE than to PE (p < 0.05) showing even at the earlier incubation time points adhesion values always of 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(4) CFU/mL, respectively. Roughness and contact angle were 0.8 +/- 0.2 mum and 92 degrees +/- 3 degrees , respectively, with no differences among samples. Qualitative differences in the surface chemical composition were revealed by XPS only. A confirmation of the decreased adhesion on VE-PE respect to PE was also registered here for C albicans strains (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E stabilization and crosslinking of UHMWPE are capable of reducing microbial adhesion. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of modulation of microbial adhesion to medical-grade UHMWPE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that VE-PE and XLPE may have an added benefit of being more resistant to bacterial adhesion, even fungal strains.
TI  - Etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  - Our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from Neurosurgery Department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. Sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) from Neurosurgery Department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. Among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95 cases with Gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases with Gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common Gram-negative bacilli included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three Gram-negative bacilli were 0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of Escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. Stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in elderly patients from Neurology Department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. Meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.
TI  - Investigation of the detection ability of an intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection system for heat-stressed bacteria.
AB  - A number of rapid microbiological methods capable of aerosol-based microbial detection are quickly emerging for use in the pharmaceutical and food markets. A subset of these technologies utilizes intrinsic microbial fluorescence as the basis for bioaerosol detection. This fundamental method of detection is relatively new to the pharmaceutical and food industries, which rely on traditional culture-based methods implemented decades ago to gain an understanding of their manufacturing environments. When combined with real time and continuous assessment, intrinsic fluorescence-based detection provides a new level of information and monitoring in these environments. One aspect of this monitoring relates to the detection of stressed micro-organisms. Bacteria found in pharmaceutical and food manufacturing environments can be in a stressed state due to heat, UV, or chemical exposure, desiccation, and so forth. As a result, the ability of an environmental monitoring system to detect stressed microbes is of particular interest. A commercially available, intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection RMM was utilized in this study to determine the ability of such systems in the detection of heat-stressed microorganisms. An assessment of culturability and growth delay in control and heat-stressed samples was performed to confirm stress. Furthermore, the performance of the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems were compared to the SAS Super 100, MAS-100 NT, and SMA air samplers in the detection of heat-stressed Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus atrophaeus spores. These bacteria were selected because they are industry-relevant organisms, commonly found in various manufacturing environments, that represent a Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and spore-forming bacteria, respectively. It was found that the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems can detect heat-stressed microorganisms, including those that are not detected by the traditional culture-based method due to the inability of the stressed microbes to form colony-forming units.

TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oil extracted from Laurus nobilis growing in Lebanon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the extracts of Laurus nobilis against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Also, the antibiofilm activity has been investigated against the biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444. MATERIALS: The polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oils extracted from the plant were used in broth microdilution methods to study the minimal inhibitory concentration, and then the minimal bactericidal concentration was determined. RESULTS: The results showed that alginate, fucoidan, fatty oils and essential oil have good antibacterial activities against the 5 bacterial strains, and a negligible biofilm eradication activity of fucoidan, laminaran, fatty oil, and essential oil was observed, but a promising biofilm eradication activity was obtained with alginate, which showed a reduced biofilm mass even at low concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts obtained have promising antibacterial capacities which need further investigation for them to be incorporated in medical or nutritional applications.
TI  - DNA extraction methods for panbacterial and panfungal PCR detection in intraocular fluids.
AB  - PURPOSE: Three different methods of DNA extraction from intraocular fluids were compared with subsequent detection for bacterial and fungal DNA by universal PCR amplification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three DNA extraction methods, from aqueous and vitreous humors, were evaluated to compare their relative efficiency. Bacterial (Gram positive and negative) and fungal strains were used in this study: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. The quality, quantification, and detection limit for DNA extraction and PCR amplification were analyzed. Validation procedures for 13 aqueous humor and 14 vitreous samples, from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis were carried out. RESULTS: The column-based extraction method was the most time-effective, achieving DNA detection limits >/=10(2) and 10(3 )CFU/100 microL for bacteria and fungi, respectively. PCR amplification detected 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of genomic DNA of E. coli, S. epidermidis and C. albicans respectively. PCR detected 90.0% of the causative agents from 27 intraocular samples collected from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis, while standard microbiological techniques could detect only 60.0%. The most frequently found organisms were Streptococcus spp. in 38.9% (n = 7) of patients and Staphylococcus spp. found in 22.2% (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The column-based extraction method for very small inocula in small volume samples (50-100 microL) of aqueous and/or vitreous humors allowed PCR amplification in all samples with sufficient quality for subsequent sequencing and identification of the microorganism in the majority of them.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of acylide derivatives bearing an aryl-tetrazolyl chain.
AB  - Seventeen acylides bearing an aryl-tetrazolyl alkyl-substituted side chain were synthesized, starting from clarithromycin, via several reactions including hydrolysis, acetylating, esterification, carbamylation, and Michael addition. The structures of all new compounds were confirmed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. All these synthesized acylides were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activities against gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), using the broth microdilution method. Results showed that compounds 10 e, 10 f, 10 g, 10 h, 10 o have good antibacterial activities.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - Total Phenolic Content and Antibacterial Activity of Five Plants of Labiatae against Four Foodborne and Some Other Bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of Thymus vulgaris, Thymus caramanicus, Zataria multiflora, Ziziphora clinopodioides and Ziziphora tenuior against four foodborne and four other bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, MRSA and Pseudomona aeruginosa and measuring the amount of total phenolics of the plants. The extracts were prepared by maceration method. Pre-evaluation of the antimicrobial effect was utilized by cup-plate technique and then Minimum Inhibitory Concentration was determined by agar dilution method according to NCCLS. The total phenolics as a possible cause of antibacterial effect, was measured by Folin-Ciocalteucolorimetry. The results showed that T. caramanicus and Z. multiflora were the most effective ones with MIC values between 0.78-3.125 mg/mL against all of the Bactria and Z. tenuior and Z. clinopodioides had the minimum antimicrobial activity. Total phenolic contents of these five plants were different and followed the general pattern of the antimicrobial effect. The antibacterial effects and the total phenolic content of T. caramanicus and Z. multiflora were remarkable and should be investigated more in future studies.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of N-acyldiamines as potential antibacterial and antifungal agents.
AB  - In continuation of our efforts to find new antimicrobial compounds, series of fatty N-acyldiamines were prepared from fatty methyl esters and 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine or 1,4-butanediamine. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and for their antifungal activity against four species of Candida (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis). Compounds 5a (N-(2-aminoethyl)dodecanamide), 5b (N-(2-aminoethyl)tetracanamide) and 6d (N-(3-aminopropyl)oleamide) were the most active against Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 1 to 16mug/mL and were evaluated for their activity against 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All the compounds exhibited good to moderate antifungal activity. Compared to chloramphenicol, compound 6b displayed a similar activity (MIC50=16mug/mL). A positive correlation could be established between lipophilicity and biological activity.
TI  - Surface-dependent inactivation of model microorganisms with shielded sliding plasma discharges and applied air flow.
AB  - Cold atmospheric plasma inactivates bacteria through reactive species produced from the applied gas. The use of cold plasma clinically has gained recent interest, as the need for alternative or supplementary strategies are necessary for preventing multi-drug resistant infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of a novel shielded sliding discharge based cold plasma reactor operated by nanosecond voltage pulses in atmospheric air on both biotic and inanimate surfaces. Bacterial inactivation was determined by direct quantification of colony forming units. The plasma activated air (afterglow) was bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis seeded on culture media, laminate, and linoleum vinyl. In general, E. coli was more susceptible to plasma exposure. A bacterial reduction was observed with the application of air alone on a laminate surface. Whole-cell real-time PCR revealed a decrease in the presence of E. coli genomic DNA on exposed samples. These findings suggest that plasma-induced bacterial inactivation is surface-dependent.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - Expression and purification of soluble porcine cystatin 11 in Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Cystatin 11 (CST11) belongs to the cystatin type 2 family of cysteine protease inhibitors and exhibits antimicrobial activity in vitro. In this study, we describe the expression and purification of recombinant porcine CST11 in the Pichia pastoris system. We then assess its antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis by liquid growth inhibition assay. Kinetic studies indicate that the recombinant porcine CST11 has high potency against E. coli and S. aureus. Scanning electronic microscope analysis showed that CST11 might be targeting the bacterial membrane and, thus, could potentially be developed as a therapeutic agent for inhibiting microbe infection without the risk of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - A refined technique for extraction of extracellular matrices from bacterial biofilms and its applicability.
AB  - Biofilm-forming bacteria embedded in polymeric extracellular matrices (ECMs) that consist of polysaccharides, proteins and/or extracellular DNAs (eDNAs) acquire high resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune systems. To understand molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation and maintenance and to develop therapeutic countermeasures against chronic biofilm-associated infections, reliable methods to isolate ECMs are inevitable. In this study, we refined the ECM extraction method recently reported and evaluated its applicability. Using three Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in which proteins, polysaccharides or eDNAs are major contributors to their integrity, ECMs were extracted using salts and detergents. We found that extraction with 1.5 M sodium chloride (NaCl) could be optimum for not only ECM proteins but also polysaccharides and eDNAs. In addition, long-time incubation was not necessary for efficient ECM isolation. Lithium chloride (LiCl) was comparative to NaCl but is more expensive. In contrast to SDS, NaCl hardly caused leakage of intracellular proteins and did not affect viability of bacterial cells within biofilms. Furthermore, this method is applicable to other bacteria such as Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, this refined method is very simple, rapid, low cost and non-invasive and could be used for a broad range of applications.
TI  - Decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  - Bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. Herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. Decoction showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. In general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. This sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. Furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses, is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity of Holothuria leucospilota Isolated From Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antimicrobial resistance toward a number of conventional antibiotics has triggered the search for antimicrobial agents from a variety of sources including the marine environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Holothuria leucospilota from Qeshm and Kharg Islands against some selected bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, sea cucumbers from two coastal cities of Persian Gulf were collected in March and May 2011 and identified by the scale method according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Antibacterial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of the body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid, methanol, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts of the body wall were evaluated by the spot test. In addition, their antifungal activity was assessed by the broth dilution method. RESULTS: The displayed effect was microbiostatic at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 microg/mL rather than microbicidal. The highest activity of hydroalcoholic extracts was exhibited by body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis. However, none of the methanol, chloroform and n-haxane extracts showed appreciable effects against Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. Moreover, cuvierian organs did not possess any antifungal potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that water-methanol extracts from the body wall of H. leucospilota possess antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, additional and in-depth studies are required to isolate and identify the active component(s).
TI  - A comparison of conventional methods for the quantification of bacterial cells after exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to potential interference of nanoparticles on bacterial quantification, there is a challenge to develop a fast, accurate and reproducible method for bacterial quantification. Currently various bacterial quantification methods are used by researchers performing nanoparticles study, but there has been no efficacy evaluation of these methods. Here we study interference of nanoparticles on three most commonly used conventional bacterial quantification methods, including colony counting to determine the colony-forming units (CFU), spectrophotometer method of optical density (OD) measurement, and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Three oxide nanoparticles including ZnO, TiO2, and SiO2 and four bacterial species including Salmonella enterica serovar Newport, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli were included in the test. Results showed that there is no apparent interference of the oxide nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by FCM measurement; CFU counting is time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation; and the spectrophotometer method using OD measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect the bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In summary, FCM measurement proved to be the best method, which is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles.
TI  - A simple and effective method to synthesize fluorescent nanoparticles using tryptophan and light and their lethal effect against bacteria.
AB  - A simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective method was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles using tryptophan and light. To prepare the nanoparticles, the following components were used: deionized water, silver nitrate, light and tryptophan. The effects of the tryptophan concentration and light exposure time on the formation of tryptophan silver nanoparticles (Tnnps) were studied. The synthesized Tnnps were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. The synthesized Tnnps were nearly spherical, with sizes of approximately 17 nm. In addition, the antibacterial activity of Tnnps was determined by monitoring the growth curves of strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecalis using the microdilution test. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for 4 of 5 tested bacteria was determined to be between 20.0 and 17.5 mug/mL for 48 h and between 22.5 and 20.0 mug/mL for 72 h.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vast numbers of plant species from northeastern Brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis INCQS 00016, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) as well as Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis INCQS 00258, Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity, a leukocyte migration model was used. Analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of Psidium guajava (EAWPg; 1.04 mug/g). The largest amounts of catechins were found in the aqueous extract of Libidibia ferrea (EALf; 1.07 mug/g) and the acetone-water extract of Parapiptadenia rigida (EAWPr; 1.0 mug/g). All extracts showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. In the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the most susceptible Gram-positive bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible Gram-negative bacterium was Shigella flexneri. EAPg and EAWPg showed the greatest MIC values. All extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). Using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for EAPr (50 mg/kg), EAWPr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and EAWPg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
TI  - Leukocyte activity in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction treated with anakinra.
AB  - Anakinra, the recombinant form of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, blunts the acute systemic inflammatory response in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), by determining a fall in peripheral blood leukocyte and plasma C-reactive protein levels. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of anakinra on the activity of leukocytes measured ex vivo. Blood was collected 72 h after admission in 17 patients enrolled in the Virginia Commonwealth University-Anakirna Remodeling Trial (2) (VCU-ART2) and randomly treated with anakinra (N=7) or placebo (N=10). Whole blood was cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 h to measure spontaneous production of IL-6 or stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 or heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) for TLR-2 activation. The cultures of anakinra-treated patients produced significantly less IL-6 spontaneously (71 pg/mL [27-114]) compared with placebo-treated patients (290 pg/mL [211-617], p=0.005). LPS- or SE-induced IL-6 production, on the other hand, was not statistically different between anakinra-versus placebo-treated patients (344 pg/mL [94-560] versus 370 pg/mL [306-991], p=0.32 for LPS, and 484 pg/mL [77-612] versus 615 pg/mL [413-871], p=0.31 for SE, respectively). IL-1 blockade with anakinra in STEMI patients results in reduced spontaneous leukocyte activity ex vivo without impairing the responsiveness to bacterial stimuli.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - [Observation of surgical treatment of a Fournier's phlegmon].
AB  
TI  - Self-defensive layer-by-layer films with bacteria-triggered antibiotic release.
AB  - We report on highly efficient, bioresponsive, controlled-release antibacterial coatings constructed by direct assembly of tannic acid (TA) with one of several cationic antibiotics (tobromycin, gentamicin, and polymyxin B) using the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. These films exhibit a distinct "self-defense" behavior triggered by acidification of the immediate environment by pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) or Escherichia coli (E. coli). Films assembled using spin-assisted and dip-assisted techniques show drastically different morphology, thickness and pH-/bacteria-triggered antibiotic release characteristics. While dip-deposited films have rough surfaces with island-like, granular structures regardless of the film thickness, spin-assisted LbL assemblies demonstrate a transition from linear deposition of uniform 2D films to a highly developed 3D morphology for films thicker than approximately 45 nm. Ellipsometry, UV-vis and mass spectrometry confirm that all coatings do not release antibiotics in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 for as long as one month in the absence of bacteria and therefore do not contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. These films do, however, release antibiotics upon pH lowering. The rate of triggered release can be controlled through the choice of assembled antibiotic and the assembly technique (spin- vs dip-deposition) and by the spinning rate used during deposition, which all affect the strength of TA-antibiotic binding. TA/antibiotic coatings as thin as 40 nm strongly inhibit S. epidermidis and E. coli bacterial growth both at surfaces and in surrounding medium, but support adhesion and proliferation of murine osteoblast cells. These coatings thus present a promising way to incorporate antibacterial agents at surfaces to prevent bacterial colonization of implanted biomedical devices.
TI  - A microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. METHOD: Included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. The children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial. The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. After performing a survey for the education, occupation, and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. The children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week. The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. RESULTS: The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Enterococcus spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Except for Candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. Moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - [Oflomelid ointment: activity against hospital microbial strains].
AB  - Ofloxacin susceptibility was tested with the use of 100 hospital isolates by the  disk diffusion method vs. the activity of Oflomelid ointment tested by the cavity method. It was shown that the hospital isolates of all the species were susceptible to the Oflomelid ointment, while susceptibility to ofloxacin was preserved in S. epidermidis, the susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus spp. being intermediate. Such a difference in the susceptibility of the isolates was evidently due to the properties of polyethylene glycols in the ointment composition.
TI  - Development and characterization of polyphenon 60 and caffeine microemulsion for  enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - Green tea catechins and caffeine have exhibited antibacterial activity; however,  their use is limited by lack of stability and effective delivery systems. Polyphenon 60 (P60) and caffeine were encapsulated in a single microemulsion (ME) formulation with an objective to lower the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the individual agents against selected pathogens (S. epidermidis and E. coli). Combination of two natural compounds would advocate two different mechanisms on the bacterial growth thereby providing for better antibacterial activity. Thermodynamically stable ME was developed and characterized with an average particle size of 17.58 nm, further confirmed by TEM analysis. Antibacterial studies included chequerboard microdilution assay to determine the MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of both the natural compounds individually and in combination. MIC and FIC results indicated that the combination of the above two natural compounds was proficient in lowering the MICs of individual agents. Results of DPPH assay indicated that ME system preserved the long term antioxidative potential of P60 and caffeine. The cytotoxicity of the optimized formulation on Vero cell line by MTT assay was found to be nontoxic to mammalian cells.
TI  - Evaluation of a universal point-of-issue assay for bacterial detection in buffy coat platelet components.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates poses a major post-transfusion infectious risk. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the BacTx((R)) assay (Immunetics Inc.) for bacterial detection in leucocyte-reduced buffy coat platelet pools and for its sensitivity in detecting clinical isolates, including bacteria that form surface-attached aggregates (biofilm positives). Platelet pools were inoculated at bacterial concentrations of 0.8-13 CFU/ml. The BacTx((R)) assay detected all species at concentrations >/=10(3) CFU/ml within 20-69 h of platelet incubation. Detection of slow-growing and biofilm-forming strains was delayed in comparison with the other strains. This assay could be used as a point-of-issue method to increase the safety of the platelet supply.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria and viruses using two monosubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines.
AB  - A zinc(II) phthalocyanine substituted with a triamino moiety and its tri-N-methylated analogue have been prepared and characterized with various spectroscopic methods. Both compounds remain non-aggregated in N,N-dimethylformamide and in water containing 0.05% Cremophor EL (v/v), and can generate singlet oxygen effectively. The photodynamic activities of these compounds have been examined against a range of bacterial strains, including the Gram-positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-43, and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Both photosensitizers are highly cytotoxic, particularly for the two Gram-positive strains, for which as low as 5 nM of dye is required to induce a 4-log reduction of their viability. The tri-N-methylated derivative has also been shown to be able to effectively inhibit the growth of a series of clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 67928 and ATCC 68507, and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984. In addition, the photodynamic inactivation of a range of viruses using these two compounds has also been investigated. Both compounds are highly photocytotoxic against the enveloped viruses influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), but exhibit no significant cytotoxicity toward the non-enveloped viruses adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and coxsackievirus (Cox B1).
TI  - Novel copper (II) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  - The incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. In this work, copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. In the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (II) (Cu(2+)) sulfate solution. In the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding Cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. Alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and Cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low pH provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior. An increase in either Cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption. The hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to the Cu(2+) ion concentration. Blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. Conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.
TI  - Synthesis and surface immobilization of antibacterial hybrid silver-poly(l-lactide) nanoparticles.
AB  - Infections associated with medical devices are a substantial healthcare problem.  Consequently, there has been increasing research and technological efforts directed toward the development of coatings that are capable of preventing bacterial colonization of the device surface. Herein, we report on novel hybrid silver loaded poly(L-lactic acid) nanoparticles (PLLA-AgNPs) with narrowly distributed sizes (17 +/- 3 nm) prepared using a combination of solvent evaporation and mini-emulsion technology. These particles were then immobilized onto solid surfaces premodified with a thin layer of allylamine plasma polymer (AApp). The antibacterial efficacy of the PLLA-AgNPs nanoparticles was studied in vitro against both gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration values against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were 0.610 and 1.156 mug . mL(-1), respectively. The capacity of the prepared coatings to prevent bacterial surface colonization was assessed in the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a strong biofilm former that causes substantial problems with medical device associated infections. The level of inhibition of bacterial growth was 98%. The substrate independent nature and the high antibacterial efficacy of coatings presented in this study may offer new alternatives for antibacterial coatings for medical devices.
TI  - A new silver based composite material for SPA water disinfection.
AB  - A new composite material based on alumina (Al2O3) modified by two surface nanocoatings - titanium dioxide (TiO2) and silver (Ag) - was studied for spa water disinfection. Regarding the most common microorganisms in bathing waters, two non-pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram positive) were selected as surrogates for bacterial contamination. The bactericidal properties of the Al2O3-TiO2-Ag material were demonstrated under various operating conditions encountered in spa water (temperature: 22-37 degrees C, presence of salt: CaCO3 or CaCl2, high oxygen content, etc.). Total removal of 10(8) CFU mL(-1) of bacteria was obtained in less than 10 min with 16 g L(-1) of material. Best results were observed for both conditions: a temperature of 37 degrees C and under aerobic condition; this latest favouring Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation. The CaCO3 salt had no impact on the bactericidal activity of the composite material and CaCl2 considerably stabilized the silver desorption from the material surface thanks to the formation of AgCl precipitate. Preliminary tests of the Al2O3-TiO2-Ag bactericidal behaviour in a continuous water flow confirmed that 2 g L(-1) of material eliminated more than 90% of a 2.0 x 10(8) CFU mL(-1) bacterial mixture after one water treatment recycle and reached the disinfection standard recommended by EPA (coliform removal = 6 log) within 22 h.
TI  - Jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome P450 biomimetic model for the metabolism of monensin A.
AB  - Monensin A is a commercially important natural product isolated from Streptomyces cinnamonensins that is primarily employed to treat coccidiosis. Monensin A selectively complexes and transports sodium cations across lipid membranes and displays a variety of biological properties. In this study, we evaluated the Jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome P450 biomimetic model to investigate the oxidation of monensin A. Mass spectrometry analysis of the products from these model systems revealed the formation of two products: 3-O-demethyl monensin A and 12-hydroxy monensin A, which are the same ones found in in vivo models. Monensin A and products obtained in biomimetic model were tested in a mitochondrial toxicity model assessment and an antimicrobial bioassay against Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus methicillin-resistant, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrated the toxicological effects of monensin A in isolated rat liver mitochondria but not its products, showing that the metabolism of monensin A is a detoxification metabolism. In addition, the antimicrobial bioassay showed that monensin A and its products possessed activity against Gram-positive microorganisms but not for Gram-negative microorganisms. The results revealed the potential of application of this biomimetic chemical model in the synthesis of drug metabolites, providing metabolites for biological tests and other purposes.
TI  - Prevention of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms during catheter exchange using antimicrobial catheters.
AB  - Exchanging a central venous catheter (CVC) over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated CVC in the presence of bacteremia can result in cross-infection of the newly exchanged CVC. A recent retrospective clinical study showed that exchanging a catheter over a guide wire in the presence of bacteremia using an antimicrobial minocycline-rifampin (M/R) catheter may improve outcomes. To expand on this, we developed an in vitro cross-contamination model of exchange to evaluate the efficacy of different antimicrobial CVCs in preventing cross-contamination of multidrug-resistant organisms during exchange. Uncoated CVCs were allowed to form biofilm by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 h, the biofilm-colonized CVCs were placed in a glass tube containing bovine calf serum plus Mueller-Hinton broth, and each catheter was exchanged over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated or an M/R-, chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS)-, or chlorhexidine-M/R (CHX-M/R)-coated CVC. Cross-contamination of exchanged catheters was enumerated by sonication and quantitative plating methods. The exchange of M/R CVCs completely prevented cross-contamination by MRSA biofilms compared to control exchanged CVCs (P<0.0001). Exchange with CHX/SS CVCs reduced but did not completely prevent cross-contamination by MRSA (P=0.005). Exchange with CHX-M/R CVCs completely prevented cross-contamination by MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans biofilms (P<0.0001). Furthermore, CHX-M/R CVCs were superior to M/R CVCs against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans (P=0.003) and were superior to CHX/SS CVCs against MRSA and P. aeruginosa (P=0.01). In conclusion, exchange with the novel CHX-M/R CVC was the only exchange effective in completely and concurrently preventing cross-contamination from bacteria and Candida.
TI  - Application of sub-micrometer vibrations to mitigate bacterial adhesion.
AB  - As a prominent concern regarding implantable devices, eliminating the threat of opportunistic bacterial infection represents a significant benefit to both patient health and device function. Current treatment options focus on chemical approaches to negate bacterial adhesion, however, these methods are in some ways limited. The scope of this study was to assess the efficacy of a novel means of modulating bacterial adhesion through the application of vibrations using magnetoelastic materials. Magnetoelastic materials possess unique magnetostrictive property that can convert a magnetic field stimulus into a mechanical deformation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that vibrational loads generated by the magnetoelastic materials significantly reduced the number of adherent bacteria on samples exposed to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus suspensions. These experiments demonstrate that vibrational loads from magnetoelastic materials can be used as a post-deployment activated means to deter bacterial adhesion and device infection.
TI  - A cleavage-potentiated fragment of tear lacritin is bactericidal.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are important as the first line of innate defense, through their tendency to disrupt bacterial membranes or intracellular pathways and potentially as the next generation of antibiotics. How they protect wet epithelia is not entirely clear, with most individually inactive under physiological conditions and many preferentially targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Tears covering the surface of the eye are bactericidal for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Here we narrow much of the bactericidal activity to a latent C-terminal fragment in the prosecretory mitogen lacritin and report that the mechanism combines membrane permeabilization with rapid metabolic changes, including reduced levels of dephosphocoenzyme A, spermidine, putrescine, and phosphatidylethanolamines and elevated alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline, glycine, lysine, serine, glutamate, cadaverine, and pyrophosphate. Thus, death by metabolic stress parallels cellular attempts to survive. Cleavage-dependent appearance of the C-terminal cationic amphipathic alpha-helix is inducible within hours by Staphylococcus epidermidis and slowly by another mechanism, in a chymotrypsin- or leupeptin protease-inhibitable manner. Although bactericidal at low micromolar levels, within a biphasic 1-10 nM dose optimum, the same domain is mitogenic and cytoprotective for epithelia via a syndecan-1 targeting mechanism dependent on heparanase. Thus, the C terminus of lacritin is multifunctional by dose and proteolytic processing and appears to play a key role in the innate protection of the eye, with wider potential benefit elsewhere as lacritin flows from exocrine secretory cells.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial effect of S53P4 bioactive glass and gentamicin impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads.
AB  - Osteomyelitis is a disease that is still difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and associated costs. The current "gold standard" in treatment - debridement and implantation of antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads - presents the disadvantage of a second surgical intervention required for the removal of the beads. We comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) and gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads. Bacterial viability was assessed hourly by Standard Plate Count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. In case of S. aureus, BAG granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads, with no statistically significant differences. In contrast, PMMA beads had a superior antibacterial effect on S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae. The antibacterial effect of BAG was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. There was a statistically significant correlation between pH values and the number of CFU in the case of S53P4 BAG granules. As a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, S53P4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Effect of binders on airborne microorganism inactivation using TiO2 photocatalytic fluorescent lamps.
AB  - 5% Degussa P25 TiO2 was spray-coated onto black-light and white-light fluorescent lamps, using five different binders, namely DURAMAX B-1000, DURAMAX D-3005, silane-69, and two polyethylene glycols with molecular weight 1000 (PEG-1000) and 700 (PEG-700). The coated lamps were tested with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, spores of Bacillus subtilis and spores of Aspergillus niger. It was found that 0.5% B-1000 and 1% PEG-1000 gave the highest inactivation rates: 93-96% from coated black-light lamps and 85-88% from coated white-light lamps for bacteria. In the case of spores, 70-72% and 55-57% inactivation rates were recorded from coated black-light and coated white-light lamps, respectively. The effects of UVA irradiance and face velocity were also examined. Significant improvement was observed from coated white-light lamps when the UVA irradiance increased. High face velocity adversely affected microorganism inactivation.
TI  - Enzymatic treatment of specimens before DNA extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). RESULTS: Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. DISCUSSION: Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Isolation, purification, and characterization of antimicrobial compound 6-[1,2-dimethyl-6-(2-methyl-allyloxy)-hexyl]-3-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-chromen-4-one from Penicillium sp. HT-28.
AB  - A fungal culture (Penicillium sp., HT-28), isolated from soil has been evaluated  for its bioactivity, which showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and was effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) also. Statistical optimization of the medium by response surface methodology (RSM) enhanced the antimicrobial activity up to 1.8-fold. Column chromatography was used to isolate the active compound (A), which was characterized to be 6-[1,2-dimethyl-6-(2-methyl-allyloxy)-hexyl]-3-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-chromen-4-one by various spectroscopic techniques such as infrared (IR), (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and mass spectroscopy. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the active compound (A) ranged from 0.5 to 15 mug/mL. Viable cell count studies of the active compound (A) showed S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella typhimurium 1 to be the most sensitive. The compound retained its bioactivity after treating it at 100 degrees C for 1 h. Furthermore, the compound (A) when tested for its biosafety was found neither to be cytotoxic nor mutagenic. The study demonstrated that an apparently novel compound isolated from Penicillium sp. (HT-28) seems to be a stable and potent antimicrobial.
TI  - Biosensor for selective detection of E. coli in spinach using the strong affinity of derivatized mannose with fimbrial lectin.
AB  - Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination in foods and water resources represents  a major threat for human health and the environment. This work exploits the strong affinity of mannose-containing oligosaccharides with the fimbrial lectin of E. coli to design novel biosensors. Modified carbohydrate ligands were synthesized by introducing phenyl residues and aliphatic chains to mannose via reductive amination in order to increase both the affinity and selectivity to E. coli compared to other pathogenic bacteria. The synthesized ligands include p-thiolphenyl aminomannose (PTAM), p-carboxyphenyl aminomannose (PCAM), 1-deoxy-1-aminomannopyranoside (DAMP), glucosamine and low molecular weight chitosan bonded to mercapto undecanoic acid. The structures of the ligands were confirmed using (1)H NMR and 1H, (13)C, COZY NMR, and ESI/MS. The ligands were immobilized onto gold electrodes and SPR surfaces using-mercaptoundecanoic acid with glycine as deactivating agent. Two detection mechanisms were tested: (i) metal-enhanced electrochemical detection (MED) and (ii) label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The introduction of phenyl residues and aliphatic side groups to the mannose-containing oligosaccharides produced extremely high affinity for E. coli with detection limit of 1 cfu/mL. The relative selectivity of these ligands for E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis were 100%, 2.6% and 8.6% respectively. The biosensors were validated using spinach leaves at 3.0 cfu/mL. The work provides a generic biosensor for other pathogenic bacteria by enabling multivalent binding, immediate recognition for pathogens as well as inhibition of bacterial growth.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. The majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. Importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. Docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (DeltaGb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Preparation and characterisation of thermoresponsive nanogels for smart antibacterial fabrics.
AB  - The present investigation involves the preparation and characterisation of silver containing nanogels and their incorporation onto the surface of woven fabrics so that they can be potentially used in biomedical applications such as wound dressings. These silver nanoparticles were mixed with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) based nanogels during and at the end of polymerisation process prior to their application onto the fabrics. NIPAM based nanogels were found to have a peak of lower critical solution temperature (LCST) that is close to the human body temperature. These nanogels were applied on cotton fabrics and cured for 15 h at 30 degrees C. Silver based nanogels were padded onto the fabrics followed by drying at 30 degrees C overnight. Scanning electron microscopy images have shown excellent distribution of silver nanoparticles on the fabric surface. EDX analysis was also conducted to confirm the presence of silver particles on the fabric surface. The results showed that a cotton fabric treated with silver based nanogels prevented the growth of bacteria, i.e. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli), on whereas the control cotton fabric samples exhibited considerable level of bacterial growth. Specifically, the nanogels in which the silver particles were added during the polymerisation process were observed to have higher antibacterial efficacy towards both types of bacteria.
TI  - Nosocomial pathogens associated with the mobile phones of healthcare workers in a hospital in Anyigba, Kogi state, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phones of healthcare workers (HCWs) could be colonized by potential bacteria pathogens. The aim of this research is to evaluate the bacterial contamination and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of isolates from mobile phones of HCWs in Grimad hospital. METHOD: A total of 112 swab samples were collected from the mobile phones of HCWs and students in June 2012 in Anyigba. While 56 samples were from HCWs in Grimad hospital, 56 samples were obtained from non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) who served as the control. The samples were all screened for bacterial pathogens by standard bacteriological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: The rate of bacterial contamination of mobile phones of HCWs was 94.6%. Bacteria isolated from mobile phones of HCWs were more resistant to antibiotics than NHCWs phones. Staphylococcus Epidermidis (42.9%) was the most frequently isolated bacteria followed by Bacillus spp. (32.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (25%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (19.6%), Escherichia Coli (14.3%), Streptococcus spp. (14.3%), Proteus spp. (12.5%), Klebsiella spp. (7.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (5.3%). Cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and tetracycline showed high levels of resistance while gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited encouraging results. CONCLUSION: The presence of bacteria pathogens associated with nosocomial infection was identified. Transmission of pathogens can be reduced by hand hygiene and regular cleaning of mobile phones.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution during actual use and typical storage conditions in community hospital and health centers. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The alcohol samples were collected immediately after the first bottle-opening (day 0) and on day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 30 from 10 stations in hospital and community health centers in Pone-na-kaew district, Sakon Nakhon province, Thailand, during May-July 2011. Bactericidal efficacy of these samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae was evaluated. Ethanol concentration was quantified by a gas chromatography method. RESULTS: Bactericidal efficacy of the alcohol samples still remained on day 30 with ethanol concentration range of 60.91-65.99% v/v. CONCLUSION: This finding should be considered as a cost-benefit model for using alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
TI  - Clinical results of linezolid in arthroplasty and trauma MRSA related infections.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the management of patients treated with linezolid for orthopaedic infections. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with orthopaedic related infections receiving a course of linezolid were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were classified into either post trauma, post arthroplasty and non trauma related infections. A diagnosis of infection was based on clinical findings, positive microbiological specimens, and positive signs of infection on radiological imaging and raised inflammatory markers. Pathogens isolated, inflammatory markers both at presentation and at final follow up, length of linezolid treatment, adverse drug reactions, concomitant anti-microbial therapy, length of hospital stay and any surgical interventions were recorded. RESULTS: Infections were classified as post arthroplasty (n = 10), post trauma surgery (n = 8) or non-trauma related infections (n = 4). Twenty patients (91%) underwent surgical intervention as part of their treatment. The number of required surgical procedures ranged from 1 to 6 (mean = 2.56). Mean total length of stay per admission was 28.5 d (range 1-160 d). Furthermore, the mean duration of treatment with linezolid of patients who had resolution of symptoms was 31 d (range 10-84 d). All patients within this group were discharged on oral linezolid. Pathogens isolated included methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, coliforms, enterococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus and pseudomonas. An overall 77% of patients demonstrated resolution of infections at follow-up, with mean C-reactive protein reducing from 123 mg/L to 13.2 mg/L. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the use of linezolid offers excellent efficacy in orthopaedic related infections when used alongside appropriate surgical management.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial effect of heavy silicone oil and conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
AB  - PURPOSE: To conduct an in vitro experimental study comparing the effectiveness of conventional silicone oil and heavy silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of conventional silicone oil (RS OIL 5000) and heavy silicone oil (heavySil 1500) was tested. The antimicrobial effects of both silicone oils were determined by the growing capability of the microorganism. RESULTS: The number of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans decreased to zero levels at the second day of inoculation in heavy silicone oil. In conventional silicone oil, the microorganisms survived longer than in heavy silicone oil. CONCLUSION: Heavy silicone oil seems to be more effective than conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
TI  - Bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using PPOm-b-PSBMAn zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  - Three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(SBMA)) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. They were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. Chemical state of surfaces was characterized by XPS while the various topographies were examined by SEM and AFM. Hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli with green fluorescent protein (E. coli GFP) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(SBMA)-covered surfaces. Results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(SBMA) to PPO ratio, as well as an important effect of surface topography. The chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. When longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. The physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. Convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best resistance to bacterial adhesion. Indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. It was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. This work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - A new cold-adapted, organic solvent stable lipase from mesophilic Staphylococcus  epidermidis AT2.
AB  - The gene encoding a cold-adapted, organic solvent stable lipase from a local soil-isolate, mesophilic Staphylococcus epidermidis AT2 was expressed in a prokaryotic system. A two-step purification of AT2 lipase was achieved using butyl sepharose and DEAE sepharose column chromatography. The final recovery and purification fold were 47.09 % and 3.45, respectively. The molecular mass of the purified lipase was estimated to be 43 kDa. AT2 lipase was found to be optimally active at pH 8 and stable at pH 6-9. Interestingly, this enzyme demonstrated remarkable stability at cold temperature (<30 degrees C) and exhibited optimal activity at a temperature of 25 degrees C. A significant enhancement of the lipolytic activity was observed in the presence of Ca(2+), Tween 60 and Tween 80. Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, a well known serine inhibitor did not cause complete inhibition of the enzymatic activity. AT2 lipase exhibited excellent preferences towards long chain triglycerides and natural oils. The lipolytic activity was stimulated by dimethylsulfoxide and diethyl ether, while more than 50 % of its activity was retained in methanol, ethanol, acetone, toluene, and n-hexane. Taken together, AT2 lipase revealed highly attractive biochemical properties especially because of its stability at low temperature and in organic solvents.
TI  - Combinatorial antimicrobial effect of curcumin with selected phytochemicals on Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is reported to be the main causative agent of nosocomial infections. It has become increasingly difficult to treat this micro-organism because of the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains and its ability to form biofilm on medical associated devices. Phytochemicals acting in synergy are effective in killing the micro-organisms by lowering the doses, and synergistic compounds evade the development of resistance due to different mechanism of action. This study aims to determine the synergistic antimicrobial potential of curcumin with cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and ellagic acid against S. epidermidis. Curcumin with ellagic acid as well as eugenol were found to have additive antimicrobial effect, whereas, in combination, curcumin and cinnamaldehyde were found to have synergistic effect against S. epidermidis (fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) = 0.5). Synergy between curcumin and cinnamaldehyde was established by time-kill kinetics and was further evaluated for antibiofilm activity. The dose required to inhibit biofilm formation was reduced to half than that needed to inhibit its planktonic culture (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin = 3.12 mug/ml; MIC of cinnamaldehyde = 15.62 mug/ml; FICI = 0.248). Both curcumin and cinnamaldehyde disrupted the bacterial membrane for killing the bacteria as determined by permeability studies on Escherichia coli ML-35p.
TI  - Control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. Alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. This study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. METHODS: Alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. At 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. The proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. The treated gel was tested against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. RESULTS: Non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) CFU/mL and within 15 sec of treatment. The treated gel inactivated 10(9) CFU/mL of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. The plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. Dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. Scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. CONCLUSION: A non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.
TI  - Synthesis of new thiobarbituric acid derived spiroheterobicyclic compounds and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series pf novel (7S, 11R)-substituted diphenyl-2,4,8,10-tetraazaspiro [5.5] undecane-3-thio-1,5,9-triones 4a-j and (7S,11R)-substituted diphenyl-2,4,8,10-tetraazaspiro[5.5] undecane-3-thio-1,5 dione, 9-thiones 5a-j were prepared using substituted aldehydes and urea/thiourea in the presence of thiobarbituric acid under solvent free, thermal and microwave conditions catalyzed by ecofriendly K-10 clay. The antibacterial potency of these compounds in vitro on the gram negative strains Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram positive strains Staphyllococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was evaluated.
TI  - Silver nanoparticles and growth factors incorporated hydroxyapatite coatings on metallic implant surfaces for enhancement of osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties.
AB  - Research on incorporation of both growth factors and silver (Ag) into hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on metallic implant surfaces for enhancing osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties is a challenging work. Generally, Ag nanoparticles are easy to agglomerate and lead to a large increase in local Ag concentration, which could potentially affect cell activity. On the other hand, growth factors immobilization requires mild processing conditions so as to maintain their activities. In this study, bone morphology protein-2 (BMP-2) and Ag nanoparticle contained HA coatings were prepared on Ti surfaces by combining electrochemical deposition (ED) of Ag and electrostatic immobilization of BMP-2. During the ED process, chitosan (CS) was selected as the stabilizing agent to chelate Ag ions and generate Ag nanoparticles that are uniformly distributed in the coatings. CS also reduces Ag toxicity while retaining its antibacterial activity. Afterwards, a BMP/heparin solution was absorbed on the CS/Ag/HA coatings. Consequently, BMP-2 was immobilized on the coatings by the electrostatic attraction between CS, heparin, and BMP-2. Sustained release of BMP-2 and Ag ions from HA coatings was successfully demonstrated for a long period. Results of antibacterial tests indicate that the CS/Ag/HA coatings have high antibacterial properties against both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Osteoblasts (OB) culture reveals that the CS/Ag/HA coatings exhibit good biocompatibility. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) culture indicates that the BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings have good osteoinductivity and promote the differentiation of BMSCs. Ti bars with BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings were implanted into the femur of rabbits to evaluate the osteoinductivity of the coatings. Results indicate that BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings favor bone formation in vivo. In summary, this study presents a convenient and effective method for the incorporation of growth factors and antibacterial agents into HA coatings. This method can be utilized to modify a variety of metallic implant surfaces.
TI  - Poly (hexamethylene biguanide) adsorption on hydrogen peroxide treated Ti-Al-V alloys and effects on wettability, antimicrobial efficacy, and cytotoxicity.
AB  - An effective amount of the antiseptic agent PHMB cannot simply be placed on the surface of titanium alloys where hydrocarbons were removed by different purification procedures. Pre-treatment of Ti6Al4V specimen with 5% H2O2 in 24 h results in extra introduced -OH and -COOH groups as well as an adsorbed water film on the surface, which provide the base for the subsequent formation of a relatively stable and multi-layered PHMB film. The superficially adhering PHMB film produces no adverse effects on MG63 cells within a 48 h-cell culture, but promotes the initial attachment and spreading of the osteoblasts on the modified Ti6Al4V surface within 15 min. After direct bacterial inoculation of the active sample, the PHMB film reacts antimicrobially against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) after surface contact. The bactericidal efficacy is only slightly reduced after using of the same specimen for re-testing the antibacterial activity. MG63 cells adhere and proliferate within 48 h on a PHMB film-containing Ti6Al4V surface, which has been pre-contaminated with S. aureus. Bacterial biofilms were only revealed in controls without PHMB.
TI  - (-)-Menthol based thixotropic hydrogel and its application as a universal antibacterial carrier.
AB  - A kind of novel hydrogelator based on (-)-menthol, a traditional cooling compound, tailed by an amino acid derivate through an alkyl chain, has been designed and synthesized. The hydrogelator containing an l-lysine can form a stable hydrogel with thixotropic character in a large pH range. An interesting feature is that the viscoelastic character of the hydrogel can be enhanced by mechanical force. The mechanism of the self-assembly process was investigated by means of IR, SEM, AFM and X-ray diffraction. The formation of three dimensional multiporous networks through acid base interactions and strong double hydrogen bonding between amino acids is proposed to be the driving force for the construction of the stable hydrogel. As a result, the hydrogelator can further gelate aqueous solutions of some confirmed antibacterial agents such as Zn(2+) and a series of water soluble organic antibiotic medicines like lincomycin, amoxicillin, etc., in such a unique way that the concentration of the antibacterial agents loaded into the hydrogel can be tuned to a large extent. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the hydrogels loaded with Zn(2+) or lincomycin is much more effective than that of the corresponding aqueous solution tested by the Oxford cup method. Furthermore, the hydrogelator is completely innoxious to living cells by measurement of MTT assay. Thus, the hydrogel can be developed as a universal carrier for antibacterial agents and may also be widely used in the fields of cell culture, tissue engineering, or drug delivery systems.
TI  - Biofilms on indwelling urologic devices: microbes and antimicrobial management prospect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms (BFs) are a potential source of highly resistant infections, frequently formed on devicesand pose problems for management. AIM: This study was to develop rational approach for prevention of indwelling urologic device associated biofilm colonization. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From randomly selected patients visiting Department of Urology of a tertiary hospital in India 150 uro catheters and 31 used ureteric stents, in-situ for > 30, were collected aseptically. The organisms were isolated and identified from washed devices dipped in broth. Evidence of bacteriuria in each case was checked by semi-quantitative method of urine culture, on day 0 and 14 of device use. The BF statuses of the device-adhered organisms were confirmed by modified method of Christensen. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. Data were analyzed using the Graphpad Prism version 5 statistical software. RESULTS: Both single and multi-species BFs were formed on catheters, whereas mono-bacterial BFs were exclusive on stents. Predominant organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.67%,69/225,) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15.11%, 34/225), Escherichia coli (13.78%, 31/225), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%, 27/225), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.44%, 19/225). Of all strains, (89.33%, 201/225) were found to be BF positive and their colonizations were early indicated by the presence of insignificant bacteriuria in follow-up urine samples. All BF isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: BF colonization was almost inevitable in prolonged used urinary devices and the most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia spp. Their colonizations usually were indicated by insignificant bacteriuria from follow-up samples. Such BF dislodged organisms were multidrug resistant and could be a source of disseminated infection, yet were in-vitro preventable by many drugs.
TI  - Nanopatterned antimicrobial enzymatic surfaces combining biocidal and fouling release properties.
AB  - Surfaces incorporating the antimicrobial enzyme, lysozyme, have been previously demonstrated to effectively disrupt bacterial cellular envelopes. As with any surface active antimicrobial, however, lysozyme-expressing surfaces become limited in their utility by the accumulation of dead bacteria and debris. Surfaces modified with environmentally responsive polymers, on the other hand, have been shown to reversibly attach and release both live and dead bacterial cells. In this work, we combine the antimicrobial activity of lysozyme with the fouling release capability of the thermally responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), which has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water at approximately 32 degrees C. Nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes were fabricated using interferometric lithography followed by surface-initiated polymerization. Lysozyme was then adsorbed into the polymer-free regions of the substrate between the brushes to achieve a hybrid surface with switchable antimicrobial activity and fouling-release ability in response to the change of temperature. The temperature triggered hydration and conformational change of the nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes provide the ability to temporally regulate the spatial concealment and exposure of adsorbed lysozyme. The biocidal efficacy and release properties of the hybrid surface were tested against Escherichia coli K12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The hybrid surfaces facilitated the attachment of bacteria at 37 degrees C for E. coli and 25 degrees C for S. epidermidis and when the temperature is above the LCST, collapsed and dehydrated PNIPAAm chains expose lysozyme to kill attached bacteria. Changing temperature across the LCST of PNIPAAm (e.g. from 37 degrees C to 25 degrees C for E. coli or from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C for S. epidermidis) to induce a hydration transition of PNIPAAm promoted the release of dead bacteria and debris from the surfaces upon mild shearing. These results suggest that nano-engineered surfaces can provide an effective way for actively mitigating short term bacterial biofouling.
TI  - Nanoscale engineering of low-fouling surfaces through polydopamine immobilisation of zwitterionic peptides.
AB  - We report a versatile approach for the design of substrate-independent low-fouling surfaces via mussel-inspired immobilisation of zwitterionic peptides. Using mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) coatings, zwitterionic glutamic acid- and lysine-based peptides were immobilised on various substrates, including noble metals, metal oxides, polymers, and semiconductors. The variation of surface chemistry and surface wettability upon surface treatment was monitored with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle measurements. Following peptide immobilisation, the surfaces became more hydrophilic due to the strong surface hydration compared with PDA-coated surfaces. The peptide-functionalised surfaces showed resistance to human blood serum adsorption and also effectively prevented the adhesion of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and mammalian cells (i.e., NIH 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells). The versatility of mussel-inspired chemistry combined with the unique biological nature and tunability of peptides allows for the design of low-fouling surfaces, making this a promising coating technique for various applications.
TI  - Rapid detection of contaminant bacteria in platelet concentrate using differential impedance.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current FDA-approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrate (PC) can yield false-negative results attributed to Poisson-limited sampling errors incurred near the time of collection that result in undetectable bacterial concentrations. Testing PC at the point of issue (POI) extends the incubation period for any contaminant bacteria increasing the probability of detection. Data are presented from time-course experiments designed to simulate POI testing of bacterially contaminated PCs at different stages of growth using differential impedance sensing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole-blood-derived PCs were typically spiked with low numbers of bacteria (approximately 100 CFU/ml) and incubated under standard PC storage conditions. Each infected unit was evaluated every two hours over a 12-h period. All samples were treated with a chemical compound that induces stress in the bacterial cells only. The development of any bacterial stress was monitored by detecting changes in the dielectric properties of the PC using differential impedance. RESULTS: Differential impedance measurements and corresponding cell counts at the different time-points are presented for six organisms implicated in post-transfusion-septic reactions. All infected PCs were detected once contaminant bacteria reached concentrations ranging between 0.6 x 10(3) and 6 x 10(3) CFU/ml irrespective of the phase of growth. Results were obtained within 30 min after the start of the assay and without the need for cell lysis or centrifugation. CONCLUSION: Differential impedance sensing can detect bacterial contamination in PC rapidly at concentrations below clinical thresholds known to cause adverse effects.
TI  - Impedance based detection of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 using a ferrocene-antimicrobial peptide modified biosensor.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 can cause life-threatening gastrointestinal diseases and has been a severe public health problem worldwide in recent years. A novel biosensor for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 is described here using a film composed of ferrocene-peptide conjugates, in which the antimicrobial peptide magainin I has been incorporated as the biorecognition element. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to investigate the surface characteristics of the newly developed biosensor and to monitor the interactions between the peptide film and the pathogenic bacteria. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were employed to confirm the immobilization of ferrocene-conjugate onto the gold surface. Non-pathogenic E. coli K12, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis were used in this study to evaluate the selectivity of the proposed biosensor. The results have shown the order of the preferential selectivity of the method is E. coli O157:H7>non-pathogenic E. coli>gram positive species. The detection of E. coli O157:H7 with a sensitivity of 10(3)cfu/mL is enabled by the biosensor. The experimental conditions have been optimized and the plot of changes of charge transfer resistance (DeltaRCT) and the logarithm of the cell concentration of E. coli O157:H7 shows a linear correlation in the range of 10(3)-10(7)cfu/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.983.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (PLTs) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. We evaluated the BacTx assay (Immunetics, Inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis- and whole blood-derived PLT units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools, inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the BacTx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. Specificity on sterile PLTs and reproducibility across different PLT units and assay kit lots was also determined. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. In time-to-detection studies after inoculation of PLTs with 0.7 to 5.3 CFUs/mL, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 PLT units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. Specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The BacTx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) CFUs/mL threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. These findings suggest that the BacTx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in PLT units and pools near time of use.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of a novel compound N-octacosan 7beta ol, from Fumaria parviflora Lam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fumaria parviflora Lam. (Fumaraceae) is widely used in traditional as well as folkloric system of medicine from ancient. It is commonly known as 'Pitpapra' or 'Shahtrah' in Indian traditional system of medicine and used for treating numerous ailments like diarrhea, fever, influenza, blood purifier and other complications. The object of the present study was to evaluate the Antileishmanial, antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic potential of isolated compound. METHODS: Methanolic extract of whole plant of Fumaria parviflora was dried under reduced pressure to obtain a dark brown residue which was adsorbed on silica gel column grade (60-120 mesh) to obtain a slurry and chromatographed over silica gel loaded column in petroleum ether-chloroform (3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 v/v). The in vitro antileishmanial evaluation of isolated compound against Leishmania donovani promastigotes was investigated by growth kinetics assay, reversibility assay, analysis of cellular morphology, adverse toxicity and determination of 50% growth inhibitory concentration (GI50). Disc diffusion and broth micro dilution methods were used to study the antibacterial (Gram + Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis; Gram - Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) potential in vitro. RESULTS: Structure elucidation by spectral data analysis revealed a novel compound, n-octacosan-7beta-ol (OC), yield (0.471%), having significant antimicrobial activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger in vitro with GI50 = 5.35, MIC 250, MIC 250 and MFC 500 and MIC 250 mug ml(-1) respectively. The isolated compound did not show adverse effect against mammalian macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence of compound suggested that it may be used as antimicrobial agent in future and may provide new platform for drug discovery programmes for leishmaniasis.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (VLBW, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. We hypothesize the built environment (BE), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature VLBW infants. Here, we present the first matched fecal-BE time series analysis of two preterm VLBW neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over the first month of life. RESULTS: Fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 device. For each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each NICU room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). Swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (EMIRGE) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16S rRNA amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an Illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. Over 24,000 full-length 16S rRNA sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. Dominant gut taxa, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. Reconstructed genomes from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the NICU environment. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. The approach enabled identification of discrete ICU reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluorescent Ag nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of fluorescent Ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm (nAg-Fs) is  demonstrated and compared with the other Ag nanoparticles of different shapes and size. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis NCIM2493 and Bacillus megaterium) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 and Escherichia coli) and fungal strains (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). Insights into the possible mechanism were investigated using fluorescence microscope and cytoplasmic materials release assay. The fluorescence microscopic measurements show that the nAg-Fs are localized at the centre of the cell, and 50% decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed upon 2-h incubation. Maximum cytoplasmic release was observed with spherical Ag nanoparticles of 10 nm. Although the nAg-F shows minimum cytoplasmic release, it has the highest activity. The microbial killing effect of nAg-Fs is actually originates from its intracellular activity. The antimicrobial activity of nAg-Fs is significantly higher than the other synthesized nanoparticles of different shapes and size. The activity of the nanoparticles has been rationalized by considering the shape, size and surface structure of the particles. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study aims to demonstrate the size and shape-dependent antimicrobial activity of Ag nanoparticles. It is shown for the first time that the fluorescent Ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm have superior antimicrobial activity with respect to the larger particles. The shape and size of the particles actually control their activity. The smaller particles can easily penetrate the cell wall and have pronounced activity. These findings may be useful in the development of potential antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Isolation of cultivable microorganisms from Polish notes and coins.
AB  - The potential role of currency in the spread of pathogenic microflora has been evaluated in many countries. In this study Polish paper notes and the coins in general circulation were assayed for the presence of cultivable bacteria and fungi. Bacterial isolates identification was based on cultural and biochemical characters and by comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Fungal isolates were recognized with biochemical and morphological criteria. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, (43.6% of the total bacterial count) including Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. epidermidis, and S. hominis, and Enteroccus spp. (30.8% of the total bacterial count), i.e. E.faecalis, E.faecium and E. durans, were the most numerous bacterial contamination. Penicillium spp., and Aspergillus spp. were the most frequently detected moulds whereas Candida spp. was the most frequent yeast isolated from currency. A visible dependence between the banknote denomination, the physical condition of paper currency, and the number of bacteria and fungi was found. The overall count of bacteria isolated from currency was thousand-fold higher than that of fungal isolates. The total amount of bacteria and fungi recovered from the coins was approximately 2.7-fold lower than that isolated from the notes. In summary, the Polish currency notes were found to be contaminated mainly with commensal bacteria and fungi while the opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas stutzeri and C. albicans were detected at a low frequency.
TI  - [Significance and prevention of post-operative wound complications].
AB  - Although surgical site infections (SSI) in dermatologic operative procedures are  extremely rare, it is important to understand risks and etiological factors to initiate risk assessment and specific preventive measures. SSI commonly are associated with a complicated, long-term and expensive outcome. Typical wound pathogens of these infections include a variety of multiresistant organisms along with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, hemolytic streptococci and the gram-negative bacilli Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Effective hygienic measures as part of an adequate quality management system should consider the critical points in the development of SSI, particularly in the setting of an outpatient dermatologic unit, such as preparation of the operative area, preoperative skin antisepsis, hand hygiene, safe and skilled technique by surgeons, and barrier nursing to prevent spread of pathogens. The baseline infection incidence in dermatologic surgery inherently is low; nevertheless significant improvements can be achieved by implementation of risk-adapted infection control measures.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Nanostructured silver-gold bimetallic SERS substrates for selective identification of bacteria in human blood.
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a potentially important tool in the rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic bacteria in biological fluids. However, for diagnostic application of this technique, it is necessary to develop a highly sensitive, stable, biocompatible and reproducible SERS-active substrate. In this work, we have developed a silver-gold bimetallic SERS surface by a simple potentiostatic electrodeposition of a thin gold layer on an electrochemically roughened nanoscopic silver substrate. The resultant substrate was very stable under atmospheric conditions and exhibited the strong Raman enhancement with the high reproducibility of the recorded SERS spectra of bacteria (E. coli, S. enterica, S. epidermidis, and B. megaterium). The coating of the antibiotic over the SERS substrate selectively captured bacteria from blood samples and also increased the Raman signal in contrast to the bare surface. Finally, we have utilized the antibiotic-coated hybrid surface to selectively identify different pathogenic bacteria, namely E. coli, S. enterica and S. epidermidis from blood samples.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - SERS detection of bacteria in water by in situ coating with Ag nanoparticles.
AB  - The bio-sensing for the convenient detection of bacteria has been widely explored with the use of various sensing materials and techniques. It is still a challenge to achieve an ultrasensitive and selective, but simple, rapid, and inexpensive detection method for bacteria. We report on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of living bacteria in drinking water by employing a synthesis of silver nanoparticles coating the cell wall of bacteria. We found that the Raman signals intensity of bacteria after AgNP synthesis mainly depends on the zeta potential of the cell wall. The enhancement of the Raman signal of bacteria using this strategy is about 30-fold higher than that in the case of a simply mixed colloid-bacterial suspension. The total assay time required is only 10 min and the total reactants' volume needed to analyze bacteria in a real environment is as low as 1 mL. Particularly, only one droplet of 3 muL sample is necessary for each SERS measurement. Furthermore, we can use this novel strategy to discriminate three strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis by hierarchy cluster analysis. Finally, we can detect bacteria down to 2.5 x 10(2) cells/mL on a hydrophobic glass slide by SERS mapping. Thus, our detection method offers prominent advantages, such as reduced assay time, simple handling, low reactant volumes, small amount of sample, and higher sensitivity and selectivity compared to previously reported label free methods. This novel strategy may be extended to open an avenue for developing various SERS-based biosensors.
TI  - Bloodstream and central line isolates from hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: data from a developing country.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) and central line infections remain among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients because of prolonged neutropenia and mucosal damage. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and outcome of bacterial and fungal isolates from patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at the Aga Khan University and Hospital's bone marrow transplant unit. All patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant with matched sibling/parent donor were included. The study period ranged from April 2004 to December 2012. Transplantation was performed according to institutional protocols. All patients were admitted in single rooms with positive pressure and high-efficiency particulate air filters. Ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, and valaciclovir were used for standard prophylaxis, which was started at the time of conditioning. All blood cultures were obtained at clinical suspicion of systemic infection, mainly documented as fever (temperature of >38.5 degrees C). BSIs and line infections were defined as isolation of bacterial or fungal pathogen from at least one blood/central line culture. RESULTS: In total, 101 of 108 patients developed febrile neutropenia. In the 101 patients, 245 documented febrile episodes occurred. There were 40 culture-positive episodes and 205 culture-negative episodes. Of these 40 culture-positive episodes, 22 patients had bloodstream isolates and 18 had central line isolates. The median +/- standard deviation time of febrile neutropenia was day 7 +/- 2 days (range: day -3 to day +13). The most common bloodstream isolate was Escherichia coli (n = 9) followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5). One patient developed Fusarium infection. In central line infections, S. epidermidis was the most common organism (n = 8). In 2 patients with central venous catheters, Candida albicans was the isolate. Transplant-related mortality from sepsis occurred in 9.2%. CONCLUSION: E.coli was mainly responsible for BSI, while gram-positive organisms dominated catheter-related febrile episodes. Transplant-related mortality due to sepsis was 9%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different natural honeys from Transylvania, Romania.
AB  - Honey is used in food industry and medicine due to its nutritive, therapeutic and dietetic qualities. The microbiological characteristics of 10 unpasteurized honey samples of known origin, collected from Transylvania beekeepers (Romania) were determined. The antibacterial activity of these types of honey against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella choleraesuis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and Listeria monocytogenes strains was studied. The most sensitive to the antibacterial activity were the two staphylococus strains (the largest diameter of inhibition zone was 18 mm) and B. subtilis strains (13.5 mm). The strains of B. cereus, E. coli, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were found to present resistance to some of the honey samples. Manna, sunflower and polyfloral honeys presented high antibacterial activity while acacia and linden honeys had a lower activity in terms of the number of sensible strains. Statistical analysis shows that the type of strains and the type of honey have influence on the diameter of inhibition.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety.
AB  - Novel pleuromutilin derivatives designed based on the structure of valnemulin were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety exhibited excellent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Compound 5b showed the highest antibacterial activities and even exceeded tiamulin. Moreover, the docking experiments provided information about the binding model between the synthesized compounds and peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA.
TI  - Evaluation of the time period for which real-time polymerase chain reaction detects dead bacteria.
AB  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently widely used for the diagnosis of infections. We evaluated the time after treatment during which real-time PCR can detect dead bacteria. The presence of bacterial DNA was identified by real-time PCR through methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS)-PCR and universal PCR. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli were each killed with alcohol, antibiotics, or heat treatment in vitro. The detection periods of MRS-PCR for MRSA treated by alcohol, vancomycin, linezolid, and heat were found to be less than 16, 8, 12, and 8 weeks, respectively. The detection period of universal PCR for S. epidermidis treated by alcohol, cefazolin, and heat was less than 20, 20, and 4 weeks, whereas that for E. coli was 8, 20, and 4 weeks, respectively. The presence of detectable bacterial DNA in infected arthroplasty patients before and after successful treatment was also assessed by MRS- and universal PCR. MRS-PCR was positive in 6 patients before treatment and all became negative after a mean interval of 20.8 weeks (95% confidential interval, 13.2 to 33.7) after treatment. Universal PCR detected remnant bacterial DNA in 4 patients at a mean of 15.2 weeks (95% CI, 12.4 to 18.0) after treatment and was negative in 7 patients at a mean of 17.3 weeks (95% CI, 10.6 to 24.0) after treatment. Our studies revealed that real-time PCR detects dead bacteria for several weeks, but this capability decreases with time and is likely lost by 20 weeks after treatment.
TI  - Zwitterionic-based stainless steel with well-defined polysulfobetaine brushes for general bioadhesive control.
AB  - Stainless steels are widely used as orthopaedic and dental implant; however, bioadhesion in the case of thrombosis, inflammation, and infection is one of their major limitations. One way to tackle this problem is to graft the stainless steel surface with a zwitterionic polymer known for being anti-bioadhesive. Controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (polySBMA) grafted from biomedical grade stainless steel surface was employed in this study. The interactions of polySBMA-grafted surfaces with biomacromolecules were demonstrated in vitro by the adhesion tests of plasma protein, blood cells, human MG63 osteoblast- and HT1080 fibroblast-like cells in biological complex media to evaluate their bioadhesive properties. Anti-microbial effects were also assessed for two most ordinary seen clinical bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Results showed that polySBMA-grafted surface exhibited evident bioadhesion resistance and conferring antibacterial efficacy. This work is also dedicated to deduce the effectiveness of polySBMA brushes' conformational structure on the prevention of bioadhesion. To this aim, the anti-bioadhesive effect of polySBMA brushes prepared by dopamine- and silane-surfaced immobilization method was evaluated. Results show that polySBMA grafted from immobilized polydopamine interfacial layers achieved better bioadhesion resistance, which could be causally related to their greater grafting coverage, flexible brush conformational structures, and greater hydration capabilities.
TI  - Characteristics of urinary tract infection pathogens and their in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in China: data from a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the characteristics of pathogens identified in clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and their in vitro sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics in the clinical setting in China. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter study was conducted between January and December 2011 in 12 hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples were collected from 356 symptomatic patients treated in the study hospitals for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent UTI or complicated UTI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 guidelines. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were tested: fosfomycin tromethamine, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, cefdinir, cefixime, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, azithromycin, nitrofurantoin and oxacillin. Escherichia coli isolates were screened and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) production was confirmed by a double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: 198 urine samples were culture-positive and 175 isolates were included in the final analysis. E coli was detected in 50% of cultures, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). The detection rate of ESBL-producing E coli was 53%. Resistance to levofloxacin was the most common among all the isolates. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin tromethamine had the greatest activity against E coli; overall, 92% and 91% of isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. E faecalis had the highest susceptibility rates to fosfomycin tromethamine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently identified pathogens in our patients were ESBL-producing E coli and E faecalis. Fosfomycin tromethamine and nitrofurantoin showed a good antimicrobial activity against UTI pathogens. They may represent good options for the empiric treatment of patients with UTI.
TI  - Influence of abiotic factors on the antimicrobial activity of chitosan.
AB  - In an effort to bypass the adverse secondary effects attributed to the traditional therapeutic approaches used to treat skin disorders (such as atopic dermatitis), alternative antimicrobials have recently been suggested. One such antimicrobial is chitosan, owing to the already proved biological properties associated with its use. However, the influence of abiotic factors on such activities warrants evaluation. This research effort assessed the antimicrobial activity of chitosan upon skin microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) in vitro when subject to a combination of different abiotic factors such as pH, ionic strength, organic acids and free fatty acids. Free fatty acids, ionic strength and pH significantly affected chitosan's capability of reducing the viable numbers of S. aureus. This antimicrobial action was potentiated in the presence of palmitic acid and a lower ionic strength (0.2% NaCl), while a higher ionic strength (0.4% NaCl) favored chitosan's action upon the reduction of viable numbers of S. epidermidis and E. coli. Although further studies are needed, these preliminary results advocate that chitosan can in the future be potentially considered as an antimicrobial of choice when handling symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis.
TI  - Composition and antibacterial activity of heracleum transcaucasicum and heracleum anisactis aerial parts essential oil.
AB  - PURPOSE: Two plant essential oils (EOs), including those from Heracleum transcaucasicum and Heracleum anisactiss (Umbeliferae) were studied to detect the chemical constituents and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: The EOs of H. transcaucasicum and H.anisactis (Apiacae) were obtained by hydrodistillation from aerial parts of the plants. The chemical analyses of the EOs were performed by GC/Mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Myristicin was found to be the principal constituent in both EOs. The susceptibility tests of EOs were performed by agar disc diffusion technique against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. RESULTS: Eight components comprising 99.97% of the total essential oil of H. transcaucasicum and a total of three compounds accounting for 98.5% of the total oil composition of aerial parts of H. anisactis were identified, of which myristicin was the main compound in both EOs. The EOs of H. transcaucasicum and H. anisactis showed weak antibacterial property against Gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis with no measurable effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our GC-MS study revealed myristicin to be the major constituent of H. transcaucasicum and H.anisactis aerial parts. In spite of all the information available on the antibacterial properties of plants essential oils, we were not able to find significant antibacterial activity for both EOs.
TI  - The antimicrobial assessment of some Nigerian herbal soap.
AB  - Twenty samples of herbal soaps were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeast of significance in skin infections with the aim to provide some justification for the continued use of the soaps in the management of superficial skin infections. All the soaps were found to possess antimicrobial activity in a concentration and organism dependent manner. The soaps were more active against the gram positive organisms than the Gram negative organisms while none of the soaps had activity against the tested yeasts. Only 35% of the soaps were appropriately packaged with adequate directions for use and storage. The study showed that the tested soaps possessed antimicrobial properties and they can contribute to the treatment and management of skin infections caused by bacteria if well prepared with the appropriate plant materials to target specific causative organisms and packaged with appropriate directions for use and storage.
TI  - Screening of serine protease inhibitors with antimicrobial activity using iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with dextran conjugated trypsin and in silico analyses of bacterial serine protease inhibition.
AB  - Plants produce a variety of proteins and peptides which are involved in their defense against pathogens. Serine protease inhibitors are a well-established class of inhibitors correlated with plant defense. Increased levels of protease inhibitors delay cell damage and expand the cell's life-span. Recently, the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens has prompted immense interest in purifying novel antimicrobial proteins or peptides from plant sources. Usually, the purification of protease inhibitors is accomplished by salt-extraction, ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography. Here, we developed a novel approach based on iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to dextran functionalized with trypsin beads that accelerate the quick screening and purification of antimicrobial peptides with serine protease inhibitor activity. The method described here also works for screening other inhibitors using particular protein kinases, and it is therefore a novel tool for use as the leading method in the development of novel antimicrobial agents with protease inhibitory activity. Finally, and no less important, molecular modelling and dynamics studies of a homologous inhibitor studied here with Escherichia coli trypsin and chymotrypsin are provided in order to shed some light on inhibitor-enzyme interactions.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Phytochemical, toxicological and antimicrobial evaluation of Lawsonia inermis extracts against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging resistance of pathogen against the currently available antimicrobial agents demands the search of new antimicrobial agents. The use of medicinal plants as natural substitute is the paramount area of research to overwhelm the drug resistance of infectious agents. Scientists have not made enough effort on the evaluation of safety of medicinal plant yet. METHODS: In the present study antimicrobial activity of Lawsonia inermis is investigated against clinical isolates of seven bacteria including four Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella spp., Shigella sonnei) and three Gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) using disc diffusion method. Four types of Lawsonia inermis extracts were prepared using methanol, chloroform, acetone and water as extraction solvents, while DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) and water as dissolution solvents. The rate and extent of bacterial killing was estimated by time-kill kinetic assay at 1x MIC of each bacterial isolate. The overall safety of Lawsonia inermis extracts was assessed in mice. RESULTS: Lawsonia inermis displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains used in the study. The minimum value of MIC for different bacterial strains ranged from 2.31 mg/ml to 9.27 mg/ml. At 1x MIC of each bacterial isolate, 3log10 decrease in CFU was recorded after 6 hours of drug exposure and no growth was observed in almost all tested bacteria after 24 hours of exposure. No sign of toxidrome were observed during in vivo toxicity evaluation in mice at 300 mg/kg concentration. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study provides the scientific rational for medicinal use of Lawsonia inermis. The use of Lawsonia inermis extracts is of great significance as substitute antimicrobial agent in therapeutics.
TI  - Domination of volumetric toughening by silver nanoparticles over interfacial strengthening of carbon nanotubes in bactericidal hydroxyapatite biocomposite.
AB  - In order to address the problem of bacterial infections in bone-substitution surgery, it is essential that bone replacement biomaterials are equipped with bactericidal components. This research aims to optimize the content of silver (Ag), a well-known antibacterial metal, in a multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced hydroxyapatite (HA) composite, to yield a bioceramic which can be used as an antibacterial and tough surface of bone replacement prosthesis. The bactericidal properties evaluated using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicate that CNT reinforcement supports growth of Gram negative E. coli bacteria (~8.5% more adhesion than pure HA); but showed a strong decrease of Gram positive S. epidermidis bacteria (~diminished to 66%) compared to that of pure HA. Small amounts of silver (2-5wt.%) already show a severe bactericidal effect when compared to that of HA-CNT (by 30% and ~60% respectively). MTT assay confirmed enhanced biocompatibility of L929 cells on HA-4wt.% CNT (~121%), HA-4wt.% CNT-1wt.% Ag (~124%) sample and HA-4wt.% CNT-2wt.% Ag (~100%) when compared to that of pure HA. The samples with higher silver content showed decreased biocompatibility (77% for HA-4wt.% CNT-5wt.% Ag sample and 73% for HA-4wt.% CNT-10wt.% Ag). Though reinforcement of 4wt.% CNT has shown an increase of fracture toughness by ~62%, silver reinforcement has shown enhancement of up to 244% (i.e. 3.43 times). Accordingly, isolation of toughening contribution indicates that volumetric toughening by silver dominates over interfacial strengthening contributed by CNTs towards enhanced fracture toughness of potential HA-Ag-CNT biocomposites.
TI  - Anti-biofilm efficacy of low temperature processed AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coating.
AB  - Biofilms are a major concern in the medical settings and food industries due to their high tolerance to antibiotics, biocides and mechanical stress. Currently, the development of novel methods to control biofilm formation is being actively pursued. In the present study, sol-gel coatings of AgCl-TiO2 nanoparticles are presented as potential anti-biofilm agents, wherein TiO2 acts as a good supporting matrix to prevent aggregation of silver and facilitates its controlled release. Low-temperature processed AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coatings inhibit biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro biofilm assay experiments demonstrated that AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coated surfaces, inhibited the development of biofilms over a period of 10days as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The silver release kinetics exhibited an initial high release, followed by a slow and sustained release. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the coatings could be attributed to the release of silver, which prevents the initial bacterial adhesion required for biofilm formation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Mediterranean Oyster mushrooms, species of genus Pleurotus (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Extracts of the Mediterranean culinary-medicinal Oyster mushrooms Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii, P. eryngii var. ferulae, P. eryngii var. elaeoselini, and P. nebrodensis were tested for their in vitro growth inhibitory activity against a group of bacterial reference strains of medical relevance: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis RP62A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, and Escherichia coli ATCC10536. All of the Pleurotus species analyzed inhibited the tested microorganisms in varying degrees. The data included in this paper for P. nebrodensis and P. eryngii var. elaeoselinii are new reports.
TI  - Mineralogical variables that control the antibacterial effectiveness of a natural clay deposit.
AB  - As antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains emerge and pose increased global health risks, new antibacterial agents are needed as alternatives to conventional antimicrobials. Naturally occurring antibacterial clays have been identified which are effective in killing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study examines a hydrothermally formed antibacterial clay deposit near Crater Lake, OR (USA). Our hypothesis is that antibacterial clays buffer pH and Eh conditions to dissolve unstable mineral phases containing transition metals (primarily Fe(2+)), while smectite interlayers serve as reservoirs for time release of bactericidal components. Model pathogens (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990) were incubated with clays from different alteration zones of the hydrothermal deposit. In vitro antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that reduced mineral zones were bactericidal, while more oxidized zones had variable antibacterial effect. TEM images showed no indication of cell lysis. Cytoplasmic condensation and cell wall accumulations of <100 nm particles were seen within both bacterial populations. Electron energy loss analysis indicates precipitation of intracellular Fe(3+)-oxide nanoparticles (<10 nm) in E. coli after 24 h. Clay minerals and pyrite buffer aqueous solutions to pH 2.5-3.1, Eh > 630 mV and contain elevated level (mM) of soluble Fe (Fe(2+) and Fe(3+)) and Al(3+). Our interpretation is that rapid uptake of Fe(2+) impairs bacterial metabolism by flooding the cell with excess Fe(2+) and overwhelming iron storage proteins. As the intracellular Fe(2+) oxidizes, it produces reactive oxygen species that damage biomolecules and precipitates Fe-oxides. The ability of antibacterial clays to buffer pH and Eh in chronic non-healing wounds to conditions of healthy skin appears key to their healing potential and viability as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Immobilized phage proteins for specific detection of staphylococci.
AB  - Rapid, specific detection of pathogenic bacteria remains a major challenge in infectious disease diagnostics. Bacteriophages can show genus- or even species-level specificity and have been developed for biosensing purposes, but the possibility of using individual phage proteins for detection has not been fully explored. This work exploits the ability of specific phage proteins, the endolysins LysK and Phi11, and the bacteriocin lysostaphin, fixed on silicon wafers to bind staphylococci. The proteins show activity against eight tested clinical isolates of S. aureus and to S. epidermidis, but no binding to Escherichia coli and limited binding to Micrococcus. Binding was quantified by clearing assays in solution and by functionalization of silicon wafers followed by light microscopy. Bacterial binding densities on functionalized surfaces were ~3 cells/100 mum(2). The small size of the proteins makes the system robust and easy to handle, and the principle is generalizable to many different biosensor platforms, including label-free systems such as optical microresonators.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of gemini quaternary ammonium salts.
AB  - A series of gemini quaternary ammonium salts (chlorides and bromides), with various hydrocarbon chain and spacer lengths, were tested. These compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were not mutagenic. The strongest antibacterial effect was observed for TMPG-10 Cl (against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and TMPG-12 Br (against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and clinical ESBL(+) isolate 434) surfactants. These compounds inhibited the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 to a polystyrene surface and eradicated biofilm formed by P. aeruginosa PAO1. The activity of studied compounds was dependent on hydrocarbon chain length.
TI  - Antimicrobial polycarbonates: investigating the impact of balancing charge and hydrophobicity using a same-centered polymer approach.
AB  - Biodegradable antimicrobial polymers are a promising solution for combating drug  resistant microbes. When designing these materials, the balance between charge and hydrophobicity significantly affects the antimicrobial activity and selectivity toward microbes over mammalian cells. Furthermore, where the charge and hydrophobicity is located on the molecules has also proven to be significant. A series of antimicrobial homopolymer polycarbonates were synthesized, where the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance was controlled by varying the spacer between the charged quaternary ammonium moiety and the polymer backbone (a "same-centered" structure where the hydrophobic moiety is directly attached to the charged moiety). These homopolymers were active against all microbes tested but depending on the spacer length some hemolytic activity was observed. To reduce the polymer hemolytic activity we systematically varied the polymer composition by copolymerizing the different monomers used in the "same center" homopolymers. By maintaining charge on each repeat unit but copolymerizing monomers having varied hydrophobic side chain lengths, polymers with high activity and selectivity were achieved. In addition, these macromolecules act via a membrane disruption mechanism, making them less likely to induce resistance.
TI  - Microbiological etiology of bacterial prostatitis in general hospital and primary care clinic in Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health classification of prostatitis reported the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially category II, at 3% to 10%. Because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis technique, chronic prostatitis syndrome (CPS) with a known bacterial origin has increased recently. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis in a general hospital and a primary care clinic (PCC) in addition to the distribution of the microorganism in chronic bacterial prostatitis in Korea. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and five patients in the general hospital and 188 patients in the PCC were enrolled in the study. Using a questionnaire, all patients were checked for symptoms of urinalysis, expressed prostate secretion (EPS), EPS or V3 culture and PCR of EPS or VB3 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genetalia, and Trichomatis vaginalis. RESULTS: In routine EPS or VB3 culture, 12 of 105 patients (11.4%) in the general hospital showed positive culture, but 77 of 188 patients (40.9%) in the PCC showed a positive culture. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were isolated in routine culture. In the PCR diagnosis, 37 of 105 patients (35.2%) in the general hospital were PCR positive, and 65 of 188 patients (34.5%) in the PCC were PCR positive. In the general hospital, C. trachomatis was the most common (49%), followed by U. urealyticum (24%), M. genetalia (16%), M. hominis (10%), and T. vaginalis (2%). In the PCC, U. urealyticum was the most common (45%), followed by C. trachomatis (34%), M. hominis (13%), M. genetalia (7%) and T. vaginalis (1%). The proportions of chronic bacterial prostatitis were 46.6% (49/105) and 67.5% (127/188) in the general hospital and PCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The total portion of chronic bacterial prostatitis was 59.3% (174/293). Culture-positive patients in the PCC were significantly higher than in the general hospital, but the number of PCR positive patients in the PCC was the same as in the general hospital.
TI  - [Pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the Changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. METHODS: This study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of Changshu area from 2008 to 2012. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification ABI 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by VITEK-2 Compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the WHONET 5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: The main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Escherichia coli (6%), Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus aureus (3%), Mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). Statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of Escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, P<0.05), Mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05), Chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05) and Enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, P<0.05), but not in other pathogens. The resistance rates of Gram-positive bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin G were both above 45%, but with no significant difference between the two, those of Oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, P<0.05) and Cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, P<0.05). The resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, P<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, P< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. However, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, P<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were remarkably increased. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but Escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. Quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection. However, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.
TI  - Involvement of the Anopheles gambiae Nimrod gene family in mosquito immune responses.
AB  - Insects fight infection using a variety of signaling pathways and immune effector proteins. In Drosophila melanogaster, three members of the Nimrod gene family (draper, nimC1 and eater) bind bacteria, and this binding leads to phagocytosis by hemocytes. The Nimrod gene family has since been identified in other insects, but their function in non-drosophilids remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the members of the Nimrod gene family in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and to assess their role in immunity. We identified and sequenced three members of this gene family, herein named draper, nimrod and eater, which are the orthologs of D. melanogaster draper, nimB2 and eater, respectively. The three genes are preferentially expressed in hemocytes and their peak developmental expression is in pupae and young adults. Infection induces the transcriptional upregulation of all three genes, but the magnitude of this upregulation becomes more attenuated as mosquitoes become older. RNAi-based knockdown of eater, but not draper or nimrod, decreased a mosquito's ability to kill Escherichia coli in the hemocoel. Knockdown of draper, eater, or any combination of Nimrod family genes rendered mosquitoes more likely to die from Staphylococcus epidermidis. Finally, knockdown of Nimrod family genes did not impact mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides defensin (def1), cecropin (cecA) or gambicin (gam1), but eater knockdown led to a decrease in mRNA levels of nitric oxide synthase. Together, these data show that members of the A. gambiae Nimrod gene family are positive regulators of the mosquito antibacterial response.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and elution kinetics of linezolid from polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  - Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) impregnated with antibiotics is widely used in the  treatment of osteomyelitis and infected arthroplasties. With the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, linezolid, which is active against gram-positive bacteria and toward which resistance has been scarce, has been suggested as an alternative. In the current in vitro study, the authors sought to determine and compare the efficacy and elution kinetics of linezolid from PMMA. Polymethylmethacrylate beads impregnated with linezolid, vancomycin, or gentamicin alone and in combinations were placed in suspensions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The leaching out concentrations of antibiotics and growth inhibitory time in days were recorded. The mechanical strength of cement beads was evaluated in accordance with International Standard 5833. The growth inhibitory time of linezolid was significantly longer than that of vancomycin and gentamicin for methicillin-resistant S aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and S epidermidis. The combination of linezolid with gentamicin and vancomycin significantly increased the growth inhibitory time compared with either antibiotic used alone. Linezolid alone or in combination with vancomycin and gentamicin showed satisfactory elution kinetics and antimicrobial activity in vitro without compromising the mechanical strength of PMMA. Future research evaluating the in vivo profile of linezolid-loaded PMMA in experimental animals is needed before it can be considered for human use.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  - Topical delivery of nitric oxide (NO) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. This study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing NO-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite A that releases NO upon contact with water. The release rate of NO from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. Minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using five common wound pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (Candida albicans). The time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. The cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3T3 fibroblast cells. Minimum microbicidal concentrations (MMCs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the MMC for C. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). Five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to NO-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. Fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same concentration of NO-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. In parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on Zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. These data indicate that ointment containing NO-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of the normal conjunctiva at high altitude area of Shimla Hills in India: a hospital based study.
AB  - AIM: To study the normal aerobic conjunctival flora in lower to mid Himalayan region of Shimla Hills. METHODS: Samples from normal conjunctiva of 200 individuals above the age of 13 years who visited Indira Gandhi Medical College Hospital Shimla for refraction or cataract surgery were taken by anaesthetising the conjunctival sac with sterile 4% Xylocaine solution. Samples were obtained by gently rubbing lower fornix with a sterile cotton wool swab moistened with normal saline and keeping the eye lids wide apart to avoid contamination from lid margins. It was immediately inoculated in Brain Heart infusion and subjected to standard aerobic culture and identification techniques. RESULTS: Totally, 72 eyes (36%) conjunctival sacs were sterile. Predominant aerobes isolated were Staphylococcus spp. in 120 (60%) followed by Haemophilus in 16 (8%), diphtheroids in 10 (5%), and Escherichia.coli (E. coli) in 4 (2%). A single aerobe was isolated from 98 eyes (49%) while 30 eyes (15%) yielded more than 1 aerobe. Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) was the most common bacterium, found alone in 58 eyes (29%) and in combination with another aerobe in 30 eyes (15%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 18 (9%) and 10 eyes (5%) respectively. CONCLUSION: S. epidermidis is the most common commensal organism followed by Haemophilus species. diphtheroids occupied the third position which otherwise are found more abundantly in literature. Pathogens like S. aureus, Staphylococcus citreus and E. coli were also found. Therefore, preoperative administration of topical broad spectrum antibiotics is extremely important in prophylaxis against ocular infection. The variation in microflora of normal conjunctiva in this part of world can be attributed to geographical, climatic and ethnic characteristics of the population under study.
TI  - A novel approach for rapid detection of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates via sensitive measurement of microbial DNA polymerase activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates (PCs) can result in serious health consequences for the affected patient. Before being released from blood banking facilities, PCs are routinely screened for bacterial contamination by culture-based tests. However, culture-based PC screening methods require extended holding and incubation periods and are prone to false-negative results due to sampling error. Screening PCs closer to the time of transfusion using rapid point-of-issue tests represents an alternative approach; however, FDA-approved assays generally suffer from a lack of sensitivity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Presented herein is the feasibility of a novel approach toward rapid, sensitive, and universal detection of bacterially contaminated PCs via selective measurement of microbial DNA polymerase activity. This approach is achieved using a differential cell lysis procedure in combination with enzymatic template generation and amplification (termed ETGA-PC assay). RESULTS: Serial dilution spiking experiments revealed an approximate sensitivity of 30 to 200 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL (mean, 85 CFUs/mL) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. An additional 22 clinically relevant strains of bacteria were also detected below 200 CFUs/mL after spiking into PC aliquots. Furthermore, the ETGA-PC assay was able to accurately monitor the presence and growth of seven clinically relevant bacterial species that were spiked into PC units. CONCLUSION: Together, the data presented here demonstrate that the ETGA-PC assay is a feasible approach for rapid and sensitive detection of bacterially contaminated PCs. Experiments, aimed at simplification and/or automation of the assay procedure, are under way.
TI  - Incidence, clinical, microbiological features and outcome of bloodstream infections in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infection is a common cause of death among hemodialysis patients. The study investigated incidence, risk factors, clinical features and outcome of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: The records of haemodialysis patients from 1999 to 2005 were reviewed. Risk factors were investigated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There were identified 148 bacteremic episodes, in 102 patients. The BSI rate was 0.52 per 1000 patient-days. Of the 148 episodes, 34 occurred in patients with permanent fistulae (0.18/1000 patient-days); 19 in patients with grafts (0.39/1000 patient-days); 28 in patients with permanent tunneled central catheters (1.03/1000 patient-days); and 67 in those with temporary-catheter (3.18/1000 patient-days). With fistula as reference, the BSI ratio was 1.84 with arteriovenous graft (P=.029), 4.85 with permanent central venous catheter (P<.001), and 14.88 with temporary catheter (P <.001). Catheter related were 41 episodes (28%). Gram positive organism were responsible for 96 episodes (65%), with S. aureus ( 55%) the most frequent, followed by S. epidermidis (26%) and Gram-negative for 36 (23%), with E. coli (39%) the most frequent. Infection was polymicrobial in 14 (9.5%). Diabetes (p<0.001), low serum albumin (p=0.040) and low hemoglobin (p<0.001) were significant risk factors. During hospitalization 18 patients (18%) died. Septic shock (p<0.001) and polymicrobial infection (p=0.041) were associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of BSI in patients undergoing hemodialysis is related to the catheter type and vascular access. Septic shock and polymicrobial infection predispose to unfavourable outcome.
TI  - Photo-activated porphyrin in combination with antibiotics: therapies against Staphylococci.
AB  - Staphylococcal infections have become difficult to treat due to antibiotic insensitivity and resistance. Antimicrobial combination therapies may minimize acquisition of resistance and photodynamic therapy is an attractive candidate for these combinations. In this manuscript, we explore combined use of antibiotics and meso-tetra (4-aminophenyl) porphine (TAPP), a cationic porphyrin, for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus contamination. We characterize the antimicrobial activity of photoactivated TAPP and show that activity is largely lost in the presence of a radical scavenger. Importantly, TAPP can be reactivated with continued, albeit attenuated, antibacterial activity. We then show that the antimicrobial activity of illuminated TAPP is additive with chloramphenicol and tobramycin for S. aureus and Escherichia coli, and synergistic for MRSA and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Chloramphenicol+methylene blue, another photosensitizer, also show additivity against S. aureus. In contrast, ceftriaxone and vancomycin do not strongly augment the low level effects of TAPP against S. aureus. Eukaryotic cells exhibit a dose-dependent toxicity with illuminated TAPP. Our results suggest that even sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of photo-activated TAPP could be used to boost the activity of waning antibiotics. This may play an important role in treatments reliant on antibiotic controlled release systems where augmentation with photo-active agents could extend their efficacy.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based TiO2 nanocomposites after cessation of UV irradiation.
AB  - Photocatalysis induced by TiO2 and UV light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. The present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of UV irradiation. We show that resin-based composites containing 20% TiO2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post UV. For biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct UV illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of Indigofera trita Linn.
AB  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of Indigofera trita L. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. A total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and 2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. Petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), Salmonella paratyphi A (12.80 mm), Streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhi and Burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). The chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), S. typhimurium (12.60 mm), S. paratyphi A, S. brunei and Yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). The acetone extract of I. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against S. epidermidis (18.20 mm), S. typhimurium (14.60 mm), S. infantis (13.80 mm), S. aureus (13.40 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and Enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. Ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (18.60 mm), S. paratyphi A (14.60 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), S. typhi (12.40 mm), S. aureus, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium and S. infantis (12.00 mm). Aqueous extract of I. trita considerably inhibited S. epidermidis (13.80 mm), S. paratyphi A and Y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), E. aerogenes and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). All the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. The result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of I. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.
TI  - Single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis treated with minimally invasive anterior debridement and fusion combined with posterior fixation via Wiltse approach.
AB  - The effect and safety of anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach were assessed in the single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Seventeen patients from 2007 to 2009 underwent anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach. Postoperative follow-up time was 24-41 months. Data included the patients' general information, microbiology, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, intervertebral fusion rate, and preoperative and final follow-up scores for American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment, visual analogue scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Ten patients had undergone a prior spinal invasive procedure, and 7 had hematogenous infection. The infected segments included L1-2, L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 in 1, 2, 5, and 9 cases, respectively. Thirteen bacterial cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4), Streptococcus (3), and Escherichia coli (1). The operative time was 213.8+/-45.6 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 180.6+/-88.1 mL. Postoperative complications consisted of urinary retention (2 cases), constipation (3), and deep vein thrombosis (2). On the final follow-up, VAS scores and ODIs were significantly lower than those of preoperation, while the ASIA grades improved. All the cases achieved good intervertebral bony fusion. Anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach can successfully treat single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis, with less trauma and reliable immobilization. It is a viable option for clinical application.
TI  - Evaluation of the anti-infectious properties of polyester vascular prostheses functionalised with cyclodextrin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Synthetic vascular graft infection (SVGI) remains associated with high morbidity-mortality rates. Newly developed polyester vascular prostheses (PVP) functionalised with cyclodextrin (PVP-CD) allowed sustained-drug-eluting of several antibiotics. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PVP-CD loaded with antibiotics against bacteria that are commonly responsible for SVGI in current practice. METHODS: Samples of PVP-CD loaded with antibiotics and uncoated-PVP were tested in-vitro for their ability to limit bacterial adhesion and prevent bacterial proliferation over time. Their anti-infectious properties were further evaluated in-vivo in a mouse model of SVGI. Both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSA) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, En. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria were tested. RESULTS: PVP-CD loaded with rifampin showed significant bacterial adhesion reduction and growth inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria. Similar results were obtained against Gram-negative bacteria with PVP-CD loaded with ciprofloxacin. In the mouse model, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial proliferations were significantly prevented by PVP-CD loaded with rifampin or with ciprofloxacin respectively. A decrease in macroscopic infections correlated with the bacterial proliferation rates depicted on the samples (Spearman's rho = 0.61; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the efficacy of PVP-CD loaded with appropriate antibiotics both in-vitro and in-vivo against six of the most common bacteria involved in human SVGI.
TI  - Crystal structure of a glucose/H+ symporter and its mechanism of action.
AB  - Glucose transporters are required to bring glucose into cells, where it is an essential energy source and precursor in protein and lipid synthesis. These transporters are involved in important common diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/H(+) symporter in an inward-facing conformation at 3.2-A resolution. The Staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/H(+) symporter is homologous to human glucose transporters, is very specific and has high avidity for glucose, and is inhibited by the human glucose transport inhibitors cytochalasin B, phloretin, and forskolin. On the basis of the crystal structure in conjunction with mutagenesis and functional studies, we propose a mechanism for glucose/H(+) symport and discuss the symport mechanism versus facilitated diffusion.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Real-time monitoring of bioaerosols via cell-lysis by air ion and ATP bioluminescence detection.
AB  - In this study, we introduce a methodology for disrupting cell membranes with air  ions coupled with ATP bioluminescence detection for real-time monitoring of bioaerosol concentrations. A carbon fiber ionizer was used to extract ATP from bacterial cells for generating ATP bioluminescence. Our methodology was tested using Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, which were aerosolized with an atomizer, and then indoor bioaerosols were also used for testing the methodology. Bioaerosol concentrations were estimated without culturing which requires several days for colony formation. Correlation equations were obtained for results acquired using our methodology (Relative Luminescent Unit (RLU)/m(3)) and a culture-based (Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/m(3)) method; CFU/m(3)=1.8 x measured RLU/m(3) for S. epidermidis and E. coli, and CFU/m(3)=1.1 x measured RLU/m(3) for indoor bioaerosols under the experimental conditions. Our methodology is an affordable solution for rapidly monitoring bioaerosols due to rapid detection time (cell-lysis time: 3 min; bioluminescence detection time: <1 min) and easy operation.
TI  - Health-care associated bacteremia in geriatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcome of health-care associated bacteremia in geriatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated cancer patients with febrile neutropenia aged >/=60years with culture proven health-care associated bacteremia between January 2005 and December 2011. The date of the first positive blood culture was regarded as the date of bacteremia onset. Primary outcome was the infection related mortality, defined as the death within 14days of bacteremia onset. RESULTS: The two most common pathogens responsible for bacteremia were Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.1%) and Escherichia coli (31.5%), with high rates of methicillin resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in infection related mortality rate according to the type of malignancy (p=0.776). By the univariate analysis, factors associated with 14day mortality among febrile neutropenic episodes were prolonged neutropenia (p=0.024), persistent fever (p=0.001), hospitalization in ICU (p<0.001) and the initial clinical presentations including respiratory failure (p<0.001), hepatic failure (p=0.013), hematological failure (p<0.001), neurological failure (p<0.001), severe sepsis (p<0.001), and septic shock (p=0.036). Multivariate analysis showed that persistent fever was an independent factor associated with infection related mortality (odds ratio, 18.0; 95% confidence interval, 5.2-62.6; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The only independent risk factor for mortality was persistent fever. Although the most frequently isolated pathogens were S. epidermidis and E. coli, high rates of methicillin resistance and ESBL production were found respectively.
TI  - Influence of glucosamine on oligochitosan solubility and antibacterial activity.
AB  - Light scattering studies indicate that oligochitosan (short-chain chitosan) solutions contain aggregates at pH values below the critical pH of phase separation, while at or above this point the gel phase coexists with the aggregate solution. This work demonstrates for the first time that the presence of D-glucosamine in an oligochitosan solution shifts the critical pH to a higher value and improves the oligochitosan antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermis in neutral and slightly alkaline aqueous media. By comparing the results of light scattering studies and antimicrobial assays one can conclude that the antimicrobial activity of oligochitosan is dependent on its unimolecular form, not its supramolecular structures. The widening of the homogeneity region of an oligochitosan solution could lead to promising biomedical applications.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Type I-E CRISPR-cas systems discriminate target from non-target DNA through base  pairing-independent PAM recognition.
AB  - Discriminating self and non-self is a universal requirement of immune systems. Adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes are centered around repetitive loci called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), into which invader DNA fragments are incorporated. CRISPR transcripts are processed into small RNAs that guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to invading nucleic acids by complementary base pairing. However, to avoid autoimmunity it is essential that these RNA-guides exclusively target invading DNA and not complementary DNA sequences (i.e., self-sequences) located in the host's own CRISPR locus. Previous work on the Type III-A CRISPR system from Staphylococcus epidermidis has demonstrated that a portion of the CRISPR RNA-guide sequence is involved in self versus non-self discrimination. This self-avoidance mechanism relies on sensing base pairing between the RNA-guide and sequences flanking the target DNA. To determine if the RNA-guide participates in self versus non-self discrimination in the Type I-E system from Escherichia coli we altered base pairing potential between the RNA-guide and the flanks of DNA targets. Here we demonstrate that Type I-E systems discriminate self from non-self through a base pairing-independent mechanism that strictly relies on the recognition of four unchangeable PAM sequences. In addition, this work reveals that the first base pair between the guide RNA and the PAM nucleotide immediately flanking the target sequence can be disrupted without affecting the interference phenotype. Remarkably, this indicates that base pairing at this position is not involved in foreign DNA recognition. Results in this paper reveal that the Type I-E mechanism of avoiding self sequences and preventing autoimmunity is fundamentally different from that employed by Type III-A systems. We propose the exclusive targeting of PAM-flanked sequences to be termed a target versus non-target discrimination mechanism.
TI  - Anti-peroxyl radical quality and antibacterial properties of rooibos infusions and their pure glycosylated polyphenolic constituents.
AB  - The anti-peroxyl radical quality of two aqueous rooibos infusions and solutions of their most abundant glycosylated polyphenols was evaluated using pyrogallol red and fluorescein-based oxygen radical absorbance ratios. It was observed that the artificial infusions, prepared using only the most abundant polyphenols present in rooibos and at concentrations similar to those found in the natural infusions, showed greater antioxidant quality than the latter infusions, reaching values close to those reported for tea infusions. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of the natural and artificial infusions was assessed against three species of bacteria: Gram (+) Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram (-) Escherichia coli. When compared to the natural infusions the artificial beverages did not demonstrate any bacterostatic/cidal activity, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of rooibos is related to compounds other than the glycosylated polyphenols employed in our study.
TI  - [Opportunistic bacteria and microbial flora in children with leukemia and neutropenic enterocolitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence of opportunistic microorganisms and microbial flora in neutropenic enterocolitis in oncohematological pediatric patients. METHODS: a prospective and observational study was done. Patients with diagnosis of acute leukemia and neutropenia were included. Stool cultures were taken to identify microorganisms and microbial flora. A chi(2) test with Yates corrections and Fisher exact test were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: 21 patients were included (12 male, 57.1 %). The stool cultures showed that 68 % of microorganisms were Gram-negative. The presence of microorganisms Gram-positive was 20 %, 6 % for Candida sp.; 3 % for Cryptosporidium sp.; and in 3 % were acid fast bacilli. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were presented in pure culture. No association was found between Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms with age, white cell count or pure or mixed cultures. CONCLUSIONS: although Gram-negative microorganisms were the most frequent, Gram-positive and other microorganisms that are not detected habitually in feces culture were isolated.
TI  - Antibacterial gold nanoparticles-biomass assisted synthesis and characterization.
AB  - Xylose is a natural monosaccharide found in biomass such as straw, pecan shells,  cottonseed hulls, and corncobs. Using this monosaccharide, we report the facile, green synthesis and characterization of stable xylose encapsulated gold nanoparticles (Xyl-GNPs) with potent antibacterial activity. Xyl-GNPs were synthesized using the reduction property of xylose in an aqueous solution containing choloraurate anions carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. These nanoparticles were stable and near spherical in shape with an average diameter of 15 +/- 5 nm. Microbiological assay results showed the concentration dependent antibacterial activity of these particles against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) bacteria. Thus the facile, environmentally friendly Xyl-GNPs have many potential applications in chemical and biomedical industries, particularly in the development of antibacterial agents in the field of biomedicine.
TI  - Phagocytosis of neonatal pathogens by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes  from newborn preterm and term infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in phagocytosis may contribute to the increased susceptibility of infants to early life infections. Data on phagocytosis of the major neonatal pathogens Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Escherichia coli (EC) by preterm infant leukocytes are inconsistent. METHODS: Cord and <24-h peripheral blood were collected from very preterm (<30.1 wks gestational age (GA)) and term (37-42 wks GA) infants. Monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis of pHrodo-labeled SE, SA, and EC were analyzed using a small-volume flow cytometry assay, with simultaneous characterization of surface activation marker expression. RESULTS: Preterm infants had lower proportions of monocytes and neutrophils capable of phagocytosis than term infants, but preterm infant phagocytes had higher phagocytic capacity. Phagocytosis was strongly correlated between cord and <24-h peripheral blood. Supplementation with exogenous complement significantly increased phagocytosis of EC but not of SE or SA. Monocyte human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression was lower in preterm infants but did not correlate with phagocytosis. CONCLUSION: There is no defect in phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils from preterm compared with term infants, although preterm infants possess fewer phagocytes, possibly contributing to susceptibility to bacterial infection. Further investigation into the development of postnatal phagocytic competence is warranted.
TI  - Comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in Ganzi autonomous prefecture.
AB  - AIM: To compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of Tibetan, Yi and Han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Yi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. The incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
TI  - Development and characterization of essential oil component-based polymer films:  a potential approach to reduce bacterial biofilm.
AB  - The development of new polymeric materials aimed to control the bacterial biofilm appears to be an important practical approach. The goal of the present study was to prepare and characterize poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) copolymer (EVA) films containing citronellol, eugenol, and linalool and evaluate their efficiency on growth and biofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in monospecies and dual species. The results showed that the addition of oil components influenced the elastic modulus (15 % decrease), the tensile stress (30 % decrease), the elongation at break (10 % increase), and the contact angle values (10-20 degrees decrease) while leaving the homogeneity of the surface unaltered. Among the polymeric films, EVA + citronellol and EVA + eugenol at 7 wt% had the best inhibitory effect. After 24-48 h of incubation, EVA + citronellol was more effective against the growth (30-60 % reduction) than EVA + eugenol (15-30 % inhibition). However, this inhibition decreased after 240 h of incubation. On the contrary, the biofilm evaluation revealed a strong inhibition trend also after prolonged incubation time: the amount of biomass per square centimeter formed on copolymer with oil components was significantly less (40-70 % decrease) than that on pure copolymer control for L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli. When polymeric materials were simultaneously inoculated with combinations of S. aureus and E. coli, the biomass accumulated was higher for EVA + citronellol and lower for EVA + eugenol than that in monoculture biofilm. The findings were similar to the results obtained by 2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay that measures the metabolic activity of viable cells.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Demonic axe-like conjugated alkynes in combating microbes.
AB  - A new series of disubstituted alkynes was obtained by microwave induced internal  splitting of the corresponding beta-oxo-alkylidenetriphenylphosphoranes. The antimicrobial potential of these conjugated alkynes and phosphoranes was assayed in vitro against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and five fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Candida rugosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The 3-pyridylalkyne derivatives viz., 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6a), 3-(2-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6b), ethyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6c), iso-propyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6d) and 3-(2,6-dichloro-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6e) were found to be highly potent towards all tested microorganisms except E. coli.
TI  - Three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of PCs. METHODS/MATERIALS: PCs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. Flow cytometry (FACS), BacT/Alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these PCs. RESULTS: At the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 CFU ml(-1), Q-PCR detected all five bacterial species tested. Screening with the BacT/Alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. Using FACS, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of 1 CFU ml(-1) on day 2. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 CFU ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. CONCLUSION: This study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of FACS in the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs was lower than that of either the BacT/Alert automated culturing method or Q-PCR.
TI  - Wall teichoic acid structure governs horizontal gene transfer between major bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) encoding virulence and resistance genes are widespread in bacterial pathogens, but it has remained unclear how they occasionally jump to new host species. Staphylococcus aureus clones exchange MGEs such as S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) with high frequency via helper phages. Here we report that the S. aureus ST395 lineage is refractory to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) with typical S. aureus but exchanges SaPIs with other species and genera including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes. ST395 produces an unusual wall teichoic acid (WTA) resembling that of its HGT partner species. Notably, distantly related bacterial species and genera undergo efficient HGT with typical S. aureus upon ectopic expression of S. aureus WTA. Combined with genomic analyses, these results indicate that a 'glycocode' of WTA structures and WTA-binding helper phages permits HGT even across long phylogenetic distances thereby shaping the evolution of Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - A ruler protein in a complex for antiviral defense determines the length of small interfering CRISPR RNAs.
AB  - Small RNAs undergo maturation events that precisely determine the length and structure required for their function. CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) encode small RNAs (crRNAs) that together with CRISPR-associated (cas) genes constitute a sequence-specific prokaryotic immune system for anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. crRNAs are subject to multiple processing events during their biogenesis, and little is known about the mechanism of the final maturation step. We show that in the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III CRISPR-Cas system, mature crRNAs are measured in a Cas10.Csm ribonucleoprotein complex to yield discrete lengths that differ by 6-nucleotide increments. We looked for mutants that impact this crRNA size pattern and found that an alanine substitution of a conserved aspartate residue of Csm3 eliminates the 6-nucleotide increments in the length of crRNAs. In vitro, recombinant Csm3 binds RNA molecules at multiple sites, producing gel-shift patterns that suggest that each protein binds 6 nucleotides of substrate. In vivo, changes in the levels of Csm3 modulate the crRNA size distribution without disrupting the 6-nucleotide periodicity. Our data support a model in which multiple Csm3 molecules within the Cas10.Csm complex bind the crRNA with a 6-nucleotide periodicity to function as a ruler that measures the extent of crRNA maturation.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Prevention of pacemaker infections with perioperative antimicrobial treatment: an in vitro study.
AB  - AIMS: The antimicrobial treatment of pacemaker casings with antiseptics (povidone-iodine or octenidine dihydrochloride) or antibiotics (vancomycin, daptomycin, cefuroxime, Tazobac, or nebacetin) was analysed in vitro for its biocompatibility and efficacy in preventing the bacterial adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli to cardiac-implantable electrophysiological devices (CIEDs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Titan platelets (0.4 cm&sup2;) cut from pacemaker casings were impregnated with seven different antimicrobial solutions: two antiseptics and five antibiotics. Subsequently, they were challenged with bacterial contamination by four test strains over a 24 h incubation period. Bacterial adherence was quantified using the colony-forming-unit method after cell recovery with sonication and examined with confocal laser scanning electron microscopy. Simultaneously, the biocompatibility of the antimicrobial impregnation was assessed using pre-treated titan platelets in a culture of human fibroblasts, skeletal myoblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells. After a 48 h incubation, cell vitality was measured using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H/tetrazoliu m monosodium (WST-8) assay. The immersion of pacemaker casings in antiseptic or antibiotic solutions applies an antimicrobial coating that can significantly reduce bacterial adhesion. The studied impregnations differed in their antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity. CONCLUSION: Compared with the two antiseptics and the other tested antibiotics, nebacetin showed the best ratio of efficacy to toxicity. Nebacetin showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens without impairing human cell vitality. It is a safe and effective candidate for CIED impregnation.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - R-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on catheters or other surgical implants. The persistent increasing resistance of S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. Thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (R-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. We found that R-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. Properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hRBCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. Excellent in vivo protective effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. Electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that R-thanatin disturbed cell division of MRSE severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of MRSE growth. These findings indicate that R-thanatin is active against the growth and biofilm formation of MRSE in vitro and in vivo. R-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating CoNS infections.
TI  - Surface self-assembled PEGylation of fluoro-based PVDF membranes via hydrophobic-driven copolymer anchoring for ultra-stable biofouling resistance.
AB  - Stable biofouling resistance is significant for general filtration requirements,  especially for the improvement of membrane lifetime. A systematic group of hyper-brush PEGylated diblock copolymers containing poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) and polystyrene (PS) was synthesized using an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method and varying PEGMA lengths. This study demonstrates the antibiofouling membrane surfaces by self-assembled anchoring PEGylated diblock copolymers of PS-b-PEGMA on the microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. Two types of copolymers are used to modify the PVDF surface, one with different PS/PEGMA molar ratios in a range from 0.3 to 2.7 but the same PS molecular weights (MWs, approximately 5.7 kDa), the other with different copolymer MWs ( approximately 11.4, 19.9, and 34.1 kDa) but the similar PS/PEGMA ratio ( approximately 1.7 +/- 0.2). It was found that the adsorption capacities of diblock copolymers on PVDF membranes decreased as molar mass ratios of PS/PEGMA ratio reduced or molecular weights of PS-b-PEGMA increased because of steric hindrance. The increase in styrene content in copolymer enhanced the stability of polymer anchoring on the membrane, and the increase in PEGMA content enhanced the protein resistance of membranes. The optimum PS/PEGMA ratio was found to be in the range between 1.5 and 2.0 with copolymer MWs above 20.0 kDa for the ultrastable resistance of protein adsorption on the PEGylated PVDF membranes. The PVDF membrane coated with such a diblock copolymer owned excellent biofouling resistance to proteins of BSA and lysozyme as well as bacterium of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis and high stable microfiltration operated with domestic wastewater solution in a membrane bioreactor.
TI  - [Application of pyrosequencing in detection of common pathogens in sepsis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply pyrosequencing technique in the detection of the common pathogens in sepsis. METHODS: The primers for amplification and sequencing in pyrosequencing were designed according to alignment of the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted for pyrosequencing, and the pathogen species were determined according to the sequencing data obtained. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing effectively yielded the sequencing data of the 28 bp sequences of the pathogens and clearly distinguished the pathogen species of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides, and Salmonella, but failed to distinguish Staphylococcus epidermidis from Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing technique can effectively distinguish the common pathogens in sepsis at the species level.
TI  - Comparative study of antibacterial and antifungal effects of rigid gas permeable  contact lens disinfecting solutions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare antimicrobial efficacy of rigid contact lens disinfecting solutions. We tested five commercially available solutions: Unique pH (Alcon Laboratories), Boston Advance (Polymer Technology Corp.), Nitilens Conditioner GP (Avizor), Total Care (AMO), Boston Simplus (Bausch&Lomb). Their efficacy to disinfect saline solution experimentally contaminated with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (isolated from our laboratory) was tested. All tested solutions reduced concentrations of bacteria and fungi below 1000 CFU/mL (Colony forming unit; reduction by 3 log and 1 log, respectively) after the 8 hours period. Overall, all contact lens care solutions showed good disinfecting activity against tested bacteria and fungi, with more variation in their antifungal than in antibacterial efficacy. Results of our study might be valuable when selecting appropriate solutions for non-compliant contact lens wearers.
TI  - Membrane perturbation action mode and structure-activity relationships of Protonectin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the neotropical social wasp Agelaia pallipes pallipes.
AB  - With the extensive use of antibiotics, multidrug-resistant bacteria emerge frequently. New antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action are urgently needed. It is now widely accepted that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could be promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this study, we aimed to study the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of protonectin, a cationic peptide from the venom of the neotropical social wasp Agelaia pallipes pallipes. We demonstrated that protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. To further understand this mechanism, the structural features of protonectin and its analogs were studied by circular dichroism (CD). The CD spectra demonstrated that protonectin and its natural analog polybia-CP formed a typical alpha-helical conformation in the membrane-mimicking environment, while its proline-substituted analog had much lower or even no alpha-helix conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the alpha-helical conformation in the membrane is required for the exhibition of antibacterial activity. In conclusion, protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity by disruption of the integrity of the bacterial membrane, and its alpha-helical confirmation in the membrane is essential for this action.
TI  - An 8-year survey of strains identified in blood cultures in a clinical haematology unit.
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria and fungi identified from blood cultures in the patients of the clinical haematology unit. A retrospective study was carried out over an 8-year period (2003-2010) in the clinical haematology unit of the Percy Military Medical Center. During this period, we collected 723 isolates: Gram-negative bacilli (70.8%) and Gram-positive cocci (18.7%). The four most commonly isolated species were Escherichia coli (18.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.8%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.2%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%). The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 6.45% and that of coagulase-negative staphylococci 61.2%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. In E. coli, as in the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, a 27% resistance to fluoroquinolones was observed. Concerning P. aeruginosa, the phenotypes were distributed over penicillinase (23.4%) and cephalosporinase (13.1% were resistant to ceftazidime). The impermeability rate of imipenem was 9.3%. The aggressiveness and duration of haematological treatments explains why infections remain one of the main complications of neutropenia. The emergence of new or unusual bacteria is highly likely. Antibiotic selective pressure and long periods of hospitalization could explain the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. As a consequence, epidemiological surveillance is indispensable.
TI  - Systematic study of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides as novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We describe the design and synthesis of a new series of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides (MW = 700) as antimicrobial agents. All of the synthesized lipopeptides were tested against a range of microbes such as Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). By systematic study of design template, we found that three ornithine residues conjugated with myristic acid are minimum requirement for a compound to be an antimicrobial agent. The most potent lipopeptide LP16 possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and has MICs in the range of 1.5-6.25 mug/mL against Escherichia coli, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and MRSE. All lipopeptides showed high selectivity toward microbial strains as compared to human red blood cells (HC50 > 250 mug/mL). Moreover, most potent lipopeptides (LP16 and LP23) did not induce drug resistance in S. aureus even after 15 rounds of passaging. In addition, a representative lipopeptide (LP16) showed tryptic stability for 24 h. These results suggest the potential of short cationic lipopeptides to boost the discovery of future antimicrobial therapeutics.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Minimal inhibitory concentration of natural vinegar and of aluminium acetate-tartrate solution.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Vinegar and aluminium acetate preparations are used for treatment of  ear infections. It is instrumental to know the minimal inhibitory concentration to get effective remedies. This study was performed to assess the lowest dilution of vinegar (specified content, 6% acetic acid) and aluminium acetate-tartrate solution (specified content, 1.4% aluminium and 6% acetic acid) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration against bacteria commonly found in chronic ear infections. BACKGROUND: Laboratory study on 2 samples of aluminium acetate-tartrate and on 1 sample of natural white wine vinegar on antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. METHODS: Performing of a susceptibility testing-determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the method of microbouillon dilution (DIN 58940 part 7). RESULTS: Acetic acid was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 0.1% to 0.2% against the tested bacteria; aluminium acetate-tartrate solution was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 1.25% to 2.5% against the tested bacteria. CONCLUSION: Vinegar respectively acetic acid diluted with water and aqueous aluminium acetate-tartrate solution could be effective ototopic preparations caused by one of the tested bacteria. For its effectiveness, an acid pH not higher than 4.5 is essential. Experiments with aluminium acetate-tartrate preparations on animals and clinical trials are required to obtain information about the response rates in ear infections and about any adverse effects.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign DNA. Therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. Here we evaluated the use of the Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pHT01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. This library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus. A new antibacterial activity against B. cereus was found upon screening in B. subtilis. The new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase K, was not active when the corresponding DNA fragment was expressed in E. coli. Our results validate the use of pHT01 as a shuttle vector and B. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of cyclodextrin-antiseptics-complexes determined by microplate laser nephelometry and ATP bioluminescence assay.
AB  - Cyclodextrins (CDs) are able to form inclusion complexes with other molecules, thereby, protecting these guest molecules from degradation, enhancing their biocompatibility or influencing their physiological distribution while retaining their activity. Here, antibacterial effects of CD-complexes with the antiseptics chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX), iodine (IOD) and polihexanide (PHMB) were determined using two different in vitro methods, microplate laser nephelometry and an ATP bioluminescence assay. Laser nephelometry is a direct method for monitoring and evaluating growth of micro-organisms by measurement of the turbidity of the solution. In contrast, the ATP bioluminescence assay determines specifically the amount of metabolic active bacterial cells. The antibacterial effects of CD-antiseptics-complexes were examined for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the results of both methods were compared in respect of calculated means of half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and statistical evaluated Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). It could be demonstrated that both methods showed a high comparability although they differ in the parameters tested. This study revealed that CD-complexes with CHX and PHMB were most effective against E. coli and the tested staphylococci. While CD-IOD-complexes obtained high activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa was distinctly more resistant compared to the other bacteria.
TI  - [Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in patients in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria  causing bloodstream infections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to provide a basis for rational clinical use of antibiotics. METHODS: The data of positive specimens, including whole blood, catheter blood and bone marrow samples, were isolated from ICU patients from January 2010 to December 2012. Disc diffusion method, micro-dilution and Etest method were used to test drug sensitivity. Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 1077 strains were isolated from 903 patients with bloodstream infection during 3 years. Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria and Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria accounted for 59.33% (639 isolates) and 40.67% (438 isolates) respectively. The 5 most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (20.06%, 216 isolates) followed in order by Escherichia coli (13.93%, 150 isolates), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.03%, 108 isolates), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.80%, 84 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.96%, 75 isolates). There was no significant difference in distribution of bacteria during 3 years. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus to most of the tested drugs. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis to quinoline/dalfopristin (4.2%) and nitrofurazone (15.3%) was relatively low, while resistance to penicillin (94.4%), linezolid (93.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (90.3%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (87.5%) and oxacillin (83.3%) was over 80%. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin (96.0%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (84.0%), linezolid (76.0%) and oxacillin (76.0%) was over 70%, and resistance to the other common antibacterial drugs was below 70%. The resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to amikacin (38.9%), nitrofurazone (91.7%), cefotetan (88.9%), ceftazidime (88.9%), ampicillin (88.9%), ceftriaxone (86.1%), the cefepime (86.1%), aztreonam (80.6%) and cefazolin (80.6%), and overall above 80%. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli to amikacin (30.0%), cefotetan (24.0%) and imipenem (16.0%) was below 30%, while resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (94.0%), levofloxacin (84.0%), ampicillin (84.0%) and ceftriaxone (80.0%) was over 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bacteria causing bloodstream infection as isolated from ICU patients, G(+) and G(-) bacteria accounted for 59.33% and 40.67%, respectively. The resistance rate of G(-) was higher than that of G(+), and resistance rate of majority of bacteria was higher than 60% on average. Before obtaining the susceptibility test Results, both G(-) and G(+) should be taken into account on choosing antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of ICU patients.
TI  - Hospital basins used to administer chlorhexidine baths are unlikely microbial reservoirs.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial activity of hydrazones derived from 3-oxido-1H-imidazole-4-carbohydrazides.
AB  - In this work we reported the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activities of hydrazones 6 obtained from 3-oxido-1H-imidazole-4-carbohydrazides 4. All new compounds were characterized by spectroscopic methods. Hydrazones 6 were tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative strains of bacteria as well as one fungal species. Three of the tested compounds appeared to be promising agents against reference strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. They were also tested against twelve clinical isolates of S. aureus and their cytotoxic effect on murine fibroblasts and HeLa human tumor cell line was determined.
TI  - Barnacle cement as surface anchor for "clicking" of antifouling and antimicrobial polymer brushes on stainless steel.
AB  - Barnacle cement (BC) was utilized 'beneficially' as a surface anchor on stainless steel (SS) for coupling of functional polymer brushes via "click" reactions in both "grafting-to" and "grafting-from" processes. Ethylene sulfide (ES), propargyl carbonylimidazole (PPC) and azidoethyl carbonylimidazole (AEC) reacted with amine and/or hydroxyl groups in BC to introduce the corresponding thiol, alkyne, and azide groups on SS surfaces (SS-thiol, SS-alkyne, and SS-azide, respectively). Antifouling zwitterionic SS-PMPC surface was prepared by thiol-ene photopolymerization of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) from the SS-thiol surface. Protein-resistant SS-PPEGMA and protein-adsorbing SS-PPFS surfaces were prepared by coupling of the respective azide-functionalized poly(poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) (azido-PPEGMA) and poly(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene) (azido-PPFS) polymer brushes in azide-alkyne "click" reaction. Antifouling alkyne-functionalized poly(N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide) (alkynyl-PHEAA) and antibacterial alkyne-functionalized poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium chloride) (alkynyl-PMETA) polymer brushes were clicked on the SS-azide surface. Adsorption of bovine serum albumin and bacteria fouling of Gram-negative Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) were investigated on the polymer-functionalized SS surfaces. The versatile bioanchor and functional polymer brush coatings are stable in an abiotic aqueous environment for over a month.
TI  - Biochemical Activities of Iranian Cymbopogon olivieri (Boiss) Bor. Essential Oil.
AB  - Cymbopogon olivieri essential oil from aerial parts was analyzed by gas chromotography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and led to the identification of 38 compounds. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) and beta-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil. The antimicrobial activity was achieved using disc-diffusion and microbroth dilution assays and microbicidal kinetics of oil was screened against different microorganisms. The possible antioxidant activity of oil was evaluated by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging system. The oil had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil exhibited inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis and fungi. Dvalues of oil were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively. The IC50 value of Cymbopogon olivieri oil was 35 mg/ml and its antioxidant activity was lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. Cymbopogon olivieri oil possesses compounds with antimicrobial properties that can be used as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (BM) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood BM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children in Kunming Children's Hospital between January 2008 and June 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 77 (66.4%) Gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) Gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. The six most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), Escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), Cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with BM, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower than 40%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. No Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. Gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood BM over the past five years. The detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. To prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to BM caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.
TI  - [Species and drug resistance of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the species and percentage changes of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward, and to analyze the drug resistance of main pathogens and the risk factors for positive blood culture (sepsis). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to analyze the species and drug sensitivity of the pathogens isolated from 2358 blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward of the West China Second University Hospital between 2008 and 2011, as well as the related clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 110 strains of pathogens were isolated, with Escherichia coli (16 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12 strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8 strains) being the most common ones. From 2008 to 2011, the percentage of Gram-positive bacteria decreased, while the percentage of Gram-negative bacteria increased. The detection rates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were 69% and 43% respectively, but both were sensitive to vancomycin. The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae were 69% and 62% respectively, but both were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Malignant tumor was a risk factor for positive blood culture (OR=3.564, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of pathogens are responsible for bloodstream infection in the pediatric hematology ward and the percentages of bacteria are changing; these pathogens have a high drug resistance rate. Malignant tumor is a risk factor for positive blood culture in the pediatric hematology ward.
TI  - Effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  - Initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. However, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. In this study, four bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass under different shears. Polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and OTS could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. In particular, the critical shear force (F(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (F(MAX)(XDLVO)) toward the secondary energy minimum as F(c-shear)=cF(MAX)(XDLVO). For these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. For S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. When considering potential protein adsorption on OTS during bacterial attachment, c of these species on OTS was slightly above 1. A greatly enhanced attachment of P. aeruginosa on OTS was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. For P. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. Such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) at higher shears by P. putida. The results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/EPS, the analysis based on the XDLVO theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols.
AB  - We report in this work the preparation and in vitro antimicrobial evaluation of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols synthesized by reductive amination of 4-alkyloxybenzaldehyde with 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol. The antibacterial activity was determined against four standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antifungal activity was evaluated against four yeast (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis). The results obtained showed a strong positive correlation between the lipophilicity and the antibiotic activity of the tested compounds. The best activities were obtained against the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC=2-16mugml(-1)) for the five compounds bearing longer alkyl chains (4c-g; 8-14 carbons), which were also the most active against Candida (MIC=2-64mugml(-1)). Compound 4e exhibited the highest levels of inhibitory activity (MIC=2-16mugml(-1)) against clinical isolates of MRSA. A concentration of twice the MIC resulted in bactericidal activity of 4d against 19 of the 21 clinical isolates.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - Detection and differentiation of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in mung bean sprouts using field deployable label-free SERS devices.
AB  - Vancomycin functionalized silver nanorod arrays substrates were used to obtain the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals of six foodborne pathogenic bacteria in mung bean sprouts samples using both a portable and a handheld Raman system. The silver nanorod arrays substrates were optimized to facilitate quantitative, rapid, and sensitive detection of Salmonella enterica serotype Anatum, Salmonella enterica serotype Cubana, Salmonella enterica serotype Stanley, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Substrate optimization was achieved by varying the nanorod length and vancomycin incubation concentration. By combining these substrates with a two-step filtration process we found that the foodborne pathogenic bacteria used in this study can be identified in mung bean sprouts with a limit of detection as low as 100 CFU ml(-1) in less than 4 h using both portable and handheld Raman systems. The results show that SERS spectra can be used to differentiate between bacterial species and serotypes when chemometric methods are employed. The low detection limit and rapid detection time of this biosensing platform for foodborne pathogenic bacteria could be a valuable field detection method for the fresh produce and food processing industries.
TI  - Functional polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes for water purification applications.
AB  - A diverse set of supported multilayer assemblies with controllable surface charge, hydrophilicity, and permeability to water and solute was fabricated by pressure driven permeation of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) solution through poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) track-etched membranes. The polyelectrolyte multilayer fabrication was confirmed by means of FTIR, SEM, AFM, ellipsometry, zetapotential, and contact angle characterization. The prepared membranes were characterized in terms of their pure water permeability, flux recovery, and resistance to organic and biofouling properties. The antifouling behavior of the membranes was assessed in terms of protein adsorption and antibacterial behavior. Finally, the membranes were tested for rejection of selected water soluble dyes to establish their usefulness for organic contaminant removal from water. The membranes were highly selective and capable of nearly complete rejection of congo red with sufficiently high fluxes. The feasibility of regenerating the prepared membranes fouled by protein was also demonstrated and good flux recovery was obtained. In summary, the multilayer approach to surface and pore modification was shown to enable the design of membranes with the unique combination of desirable separation characteristics, regenerability of the separation layer, and antifouling behavior.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel pleuromutilin derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thioether moiety has been  synthesized via acylation reaction under mild conditions. Their in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. Among the 17 compounds screened, 14-O-[(4-methoxybenzamide-2- methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 4i, 14-O-[(2-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5a and 14-O-[(4-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5c were resulted as most active antibacterial agents.
TI  - Synthesis and concentration dependent antibacterial activities of CuO nanoflakes.
AB  - We report, synthesis and antibacterial activities of CuO nanoflakes. CuO nanoparticles are prepared at room temperature through sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction studies show the particles are monoclinic (crystalline) in nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly show that the prepared particles are flake like in structure. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibits three different bands that correspond to the Au and Bu modes. Antibacterial studies were performed on Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas liquefaciens bacterial strains. Among these bacterial strains, S. flexneri and B. subtilis are most sensitive to copper oxide nanoparticles than the positive control (Penicillin G) and S. typhimurium strain shows the less sensitive. Results show that sensitivity is highly dependent on the concentrations of CuO nanoflakes.
TI  - Antibiotic selection for the treatment of infectious complications of implant-based breast reconstruction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. There are many treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. In the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. We hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future. METHODS: A retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from November 2007 to May 2011 was conducted. Implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. Patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. Five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. Twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer invasion into the skin. Reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps, and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. Thirty explants had microbiology data available. The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (5), Serratia marcescens (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter (2), group B streptococcus (1), and Morganella morganii (1). Forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to Levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. Based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. If this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. Obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity and inflammatory response of novel plastics  embedded with silver nanoparticles.
AB  - AIM: Infections associated with medical devices are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Microorganisms are responsible for catheter infections that may then result in the local or systemic dissemination of the microorganism into the bloodstream. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) embedded in polyurethane plastics, commonly used for catheter fabrication. MATERIALS & METHODS: AgNPs in the range of 25-30 nm were synthesized and embedded in polyurethane plastics at different concentrations. The antimicrobial activities of these plastics were tested against the three pathogenic microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans, frequently associated with catheter infections. The cytotoxicity of the plastics was evaluated on human-derived macrophages using propidium iodide and the secretion of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a was measured using ELISA. RESULTS: A significant reduction of 6- to 7-log in the number of bacteria was measured, while a reduction of 90% was measured in the case of C. albicans. Neither cytotoxic effect on macrophages nor immunological response was observed. CONCLUSION: Plastics embedded with AgNPs have great potential to limit microbial colonization of implanted medical devices.
TI  - [Microbial and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. The use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. At present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. In relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, Hi-Fatigue G, Palacos R+G, VancogenX, and Palacos R as a control. Bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. The strains used for bacterial load included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. In addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. RESULTS: All antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. The bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of S. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. The antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. The major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from VancogenX to MH medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of the experiment. In physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. Release of gentamicin from VancogenX was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in MH medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the experiment while no gentamicin was found in MH medium after 72 hours. DISCUSSION: The antimicrobial effect of VancogenX bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. However, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. In MH medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from VancogenX only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. It is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. CONCLUSIONS: The bone cement VancogenX showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended for use in orthopaedic practice. Therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. Extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Antiseptic cyclodextrin-functionalized hydrogels and gauzes for loading and delivery of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - Prevention and management of wound infections receive a lot of attention, since the presence of micro-organisms interferes with the wound-healing process. The aim of this work was to use cyclodextrins (CDs) to endow hydrogels and gauzes with the ability to take up antiseptics and sustain their delivery for several hours. Benzalkonium chloride (BzCl) can form inclusion complexes with cross-linked CDs that regulate the release through an affinity-driven mechanism. Grafting of CDs to cotton gauzes using citric acid as the linker, at 190 degrees C and for 15 min, led to grafting yields of about 148%, much larger than those obtained at 180 degrees C or with shorter reaction times. Microbiological tests revealed that the BzCl-loaded networks can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli both on agar plates and in liquid medium. Furthermore, the antiseptic-loaded gauzes were able to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus RN1HG pMV158GFP when applied in early stages of biofilm formation and could reduce the number of living cells in preformed biofilms grown in a chronic wound biofilm model. These findings highlight the role of CDs as main components of hydrogels and gauzes for the efficient delivery of antiseptics.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SHMG) and edetate disodium (EDTA), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% SHMG and 0.1% EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U.S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (SHMG/EDTA) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution and risk factors of nosocomial infections in neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogen distribution and risk factors of nosocomial infections in neonates in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU). METHODS: The clinical data of 145 neonates with nosocomial infection in the NICU were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 145 neonates, 41 (28.3%) were infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 39 (26.9%) with Escherichia coli, 10 (6.9%) with Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 55 (37.9%) with other pathogens. Logistic regression analysis showed that a gestational age of </=32 weeks (OR=5.57), birth weigh of <1500 g (OR=6.95), hospitalization time (OR=1.23), mechanical ventilation (OR=14.12) and parenteral nutrition (OR=3.01) were major risk factors for nosocomial infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five factors were also main risk factors for nosocomial infection caused by Escherichia coli, with the OR of 3.42, 6.73, 9.96, 0.55 and 2.13 respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but were relatively sensitive to levofloxacin and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis are major pathogens of nosocomial infections in neonates in the NICU and they are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Mechanical ventilation and hospitalization time are the most important risk factors for nosocomial infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam.
AB  - 4-(alpha-L-Rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. Isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi E. floccosum and T. rubrum. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (IZ) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against S. aureus, good to moderate activity against S. epidermidis, moderate activity against B. subtilis, and weak activity against E. floccosum and T. rubrum. The in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the Gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by MBC:MIC ratios of 2:1.
TI  - Tandem multicomponent reactions toward the design and synthesis of novel antibacterial and cytotoxic motifs.
AB  - The synthesis of polysubstituted imidazopyridines and imidazopyrazines through the orthogonal union of Groebke-Blackburn and Ugi reactions is described. These motifs were produced efficiently in a tandem operation without intermediate isolation. The synthesized scaffolds were biologically evaluated and found to possess potent anticancer and anti bacterial activities. Importantly, some of these motifs (e.g. compound 5) were found to possess specific anti-breast cancer activity against MCF7 cell line and others (e.g. compound 15) possess specific effects against melanoma cancer cell line (M8). Interestingly, the introduction of imidazobenzothiazole framework produced compounds with potent anti cancer activities (e.g. compounds 29 and 33) in vitro. Interestingly, many of synthesized compounds displayed potent and broad spectrum antibacterial activity against hospital-resistant clinical isolates namely, Escherichia coli, Klebsiellapneuomoniae, Staph. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris. Furthermore, many of the synthesized motifs were found to effective against Gram positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MMSA; ATCC 25923), andmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; ATCC 35591). These findings, however, form the foundation for further investigation in our continuing efforts to develop selective anticancer and antibacterial agents.
TI  - Bacterial growth in red blood cell units exposed to uncontrolled temperatures: challenging the 30-minute rule.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The '30-min rule' requires discarding red blood cells  (RBCs) exposed to uncontrolled temperatures for >30 min to ensure safe RBC transfusion. This study was aimed at determining whether multiple room temperature (RT) exposures promote bacterial growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled and split RBC units were inoculated with ~1 CFU/ml of Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Control units remained in storage, while test units were exposed to RT for six 30-min or three 60-min intervals. Bacterial concentrations and endotoxin levels were determined after each exposure and at 42 days of storage. RBC core temperature and RT were monitored in mock units with Escort iLog temperature loggers. A mixed model was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Red blood cell core temperature reached 10.7 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 14.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C during 30- and 60-min exposures, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli did not grow in either control or exposed RBCs. Yersinia enterocolitica concentration and endotoxin levels were similar in both control and test units. Serratia marcescens concentration and endotoxin levels were higher in exposed units; however, differences between units exposed for 30 min or 60 min were not observed. CONCLUSION: There is no added risk to RBC safety by increasing RT exposures to 60 min with each removal from storage for up to a total of 3 h during RBC shelf life. Therefore, extending the 30-min limitation in RBCs exposed to uncontrolled temperatures to 60 min should be considered by regulatory agencies.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of DNA aptamers against Escherichia coli using a bacterial cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment approach.
AB  - Aptamers are powerful capturing probes against various targets such as proteins,  small organic compounds, metal ions, and even cells. In this study, we isolated and characterized single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers against Escherichia coli. A total of 28 ssDNAs were isolated after 10 rounds of selection using a bacterial cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process. Other bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were used for counter selection to enhance the selectivity of ssDNA aptamers against E. coli. Finally, four ssDNA aptamers showed high affinity and selectivity to E. coli, The dissociation constants (K(d)) of these four ssDNA aptamers to E. coli were estimated to range from 12.4 to 25.2 nM. These aptamers did not bind to other bacterial species, including four counter cells, but they showed affinity to different E. coli strains. The binding of these four aptamers to E. coli was observed directly by fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) polyphenols.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L. monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S. aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S. aureus.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  Cristaria plicata.
AB  - Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length cDNA sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The cDNA contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 degrees C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.
TI  - Dual functionality of antimicrobial and antifouling of poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide)/salicylate hydrogels.
AB  - The emergence and reemergence of microbial infection demand an urgent response to develop effective biomaterials that prevent biofilm formation and associated bacterial infection. In this work, we have synthesized and characterized hybrid poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (polyHEAA)/salicylate (SA) hydrogels with integrated antifouling and antimicrobial capacities. The antifouling efficacy of polyHEAA hydrogels was examined via exposure to proteins, cells, and bacteria, while the antimicrobial activity of SA-treated polyHEAA hydrogels was investigated against both gram-negative Escherichia coli RP437 and gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis. The results showed that polyHEAA/SA hydrogels exhibited high surface resistance to protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and bacteria attachment. The polyHEAA hydrogels were also characterized by their water content and state of water, revealing a strong ability to contain and retain high nonfreezable water content. This work demonstrates that the hybrid polyHEAA/SA hydrogels can be engineered to possess both antifouling and antimicrobial properties, which can be used for different in vitro and in vivo applications against bacterial infection.
TI  - First syntheses of the biologically active fungal metabolites pestalotiopsones A, B, C and F.
AB  - A synthetic approach accessing the pestalotiopsones, fungal chromones possessing  a rare skeletal subtype, is reported for the first time. The synthesis of pestalotiopsone A (1) has been achieved in 7 linear steps (28%), from commercially available 3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid and subsequently the first syntheses of pestalotiopsone B (2), C (3) and F (4) were performed utilising this chemistry. The key steps include a newly described homologation of a substituted benzoic acid to afford phenylacetate derivatives utilising Birch reductive alkylation conditions, a microwave mediated chromanone formation proceeding through an oxa-Michael cyclisation, and an IBX induced dehydrogenation to the desired chromone skeleton. The synthetic natural products were completely characterised for the first time, confirming their structures and their biological activities evaluated against a panel of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [DHS osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures: infectious complications].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Evaluation of infectious complications in patients with proximal femoral fractures treated by osteosynthesis using dynamic hip screws (DHS). MATERIAL: The group included 501 patients with 532 DHS procedures performed in the years 1996-2010. In 31 patients osteosynthesis was carried out bilaterally. METHODS: Osteosynthesis was indicated for femoral neck fracture in 18 hips and for pertrochanteric fracture in 514 hips. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered within 48 hours of surgery. The occurrence of infectious complications (surface and deep wound infection), presence of infectious agents, risk factors, and the course of treatment and its outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Of 532 fractures treated by DHS osteosynthesis, seven were infected (1.3%) as follows: one fracture of the femoral neck with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and, of six pertrochanteric fractures, four with Staphylococcus aureus, one with Escherichia coli and one with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Surface wound infection was diagnosed in one case (0.2%) and deep infection in six cases (1.1%). Five revision DHS procedures were carried out in five patients. One or more risk factors were found in each patient with infected DHS. The treatment of infection included wound dressing and abscess drainage without reoperation in two cases, implant removal in three, and implant removal with femoral head resection and spacer insertion in two cases. Second-stage total hip arthroplasty (THA) was performed in one case. Of the seven infected fractures, five (71%) healed successfully. DISCUSSION DHS osteosynthesis is a reliable method for treating proximal femoral fractures. The 1.3% infection rate in our group is comparable with other relevant studies. This complication is serious and requires prolonged treatment but is not as devastating as an infected THA. For the treatment of infected DHS osteosynthesis, standard methods from screw removal to second-stage THA were employed. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious complications following osteosynthesis with dynamic hip screws are rare events in the treatment of proximal femoral fractures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated infectious agent. Each infectious complacation was associated with one or more risk factors. Antibiotic prophylaxis is important particularly in patients at risk.
TI  - Antimicrobial durability of air filters coated with airborne Sophora flavescens nanoparticles.
AB  - Airborne biological particles containing viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi can be toxic and cause infections and allergy symptoms. Recently, natural materials such as tea tree oil and Sophora flavescens have shown promising antimicrobial activity when applied as air filter media. Although many of these studies demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy, only a few of them considered external environmental effects such as the surrounding humidity, temperature, and natural degradation of chemicals, all of which can affect the antimicrobial performance of these natural materials. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial durability of air filters containing airborne nanoparticles from S. flavescens for 5 months. Antimicrobial tests and quantitative chemical analyses were performed every 30 days. Morphological changes in the nanoparticles were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The major antimicrobial compounds remained stable and active for ~90 days at room temperature. After about 90 days, the quantities of major antimicrobial compounds decreased noticeably with a consequent decrease in antimicrobial activity. These results are promising for the implementation of new technologies using natural antimicrobial products and provide useful information regarding the average life expectancy of antimicrobial filters using nanoparticles of S. flavescens.
TI  - Medicinal potential of ciprofloxacin and its derivatives.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin (CP) is a fluoroquinolone that is highly active against diverse microorganisms. At concentrations less than 1 microg/ml it is active against a diverse types of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillius subtilius, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, it has shown to be effective against other diseases such as malaria, cancer and AIDS. The extended antimicrobial activity, lack of plasmid-mediated resistance, large volume of distribution and minimal adverse effects of CP are therapeutically advantageous. In the pursuit of increasing their effectiveness against these diseases and prevent unwanted resistance, researchers have begun to synthesize a class of organic, inorganic and organometallic derivatives, which have displayed interesting activities. This review describes the development and recent advances on the evaluation of CP and its derivatives as a new class of drugs with potential for clinical development.
TI  - Pathogenesis of bloodstream infection in children with blood cancer.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to characterize the distribution and antibiotic  resistance of pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the Hematology and Oncology department of the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School (Hangzhou, China), between January and December 2010 and to provide early and appropriate support for the clinical administration of antibiotics. Out of 1,500 inpatients, 161 children who were diagnosed with BSI based on the national diagnostic criteria were retrospectively analyzed. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the peripheral blood of less than 0.5x10(9) cells/l. A microbiologically documented infection (MDI) was defined as when the causative pathogen was isolated from the blood. Drug susceptibility tests were performed using a VITEK-60 AutoMicrobic System and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The data were analyzed using STATA software (version 9.0) and a two-sided P-value of </=0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. A total of 79 strains were isolated from the blood specimens. The incidence of BSI was 10.73% (161/1,500). Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 55.70, 43.04 and 1.27% of the BSIs, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis (20.25%), Escherichia coli (15.19%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.19%) were frequently identified isolates. The staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, while Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem. In conclusion, Gram-positive bacteria are slightly more prevalent than Gram-negative bacteria in BSI and the selection of antibiotics according to the susceptibility test results is superior to empirical treatment. It is essential to administer antimicrobial agents early and appropriately to treat child blood cancer patients with BSI.
TI  - Photoinactivation of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer eosin Y.
AB  - We test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin Y upon conjugation. The conjugate eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Photoinactivation assays were performed against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AYE, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Partitioning assays were performed with E. coli and S. aureus . Photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) CFU/mL of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 muM or below. In contrast, neither eosin Y nor (KLAKLAK)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. The increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (KLAKLAK)(2) promotes the association of eosin Y to bacteria. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines HaCaT, COS-7, and COLO 316. Consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. The peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin Y toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. Overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (KLAKLAK)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.
TI  - Understanding the dark and light-enhanced bactericidal action of cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes and oligomers.
AB  - A multiscale investigation was carried out to study the dark and light-enhanced bactericidal mechanisms of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (OPEs). On the morphological scale, Gram-negative E. coli cells exposed to CPE and OPE compounds in the dark show damage to the cell envelope, plasma membrane, and in some cases the cytoplasm, while with UV-irradiation, E. coli sustained catastrophic damages to both the cell envelope and cytoplasm. In contrast, the Gram-positive S. epi bacteria appeared intact when exposed to CPE and OPE compounds in the dark but showed damages to the cell envelope with UV-irradiation. To better understand the molecular basis of CPE- and OPE-induced morphological changes and damages to bacteria, we investigated the effect of these compounds on model bacterial plasma membrane and bacterial proteins and plasmid DNA. Measurements of dark membrane perturbation activity of the CPEs and OPEs using model lipid membranes support a carpet or detergent-like mechanism by which the antimicrobial compounds induce membrane collapse and phase transitions. Under UV-irradiation, E. coli bacteria exposed to CPEs and OPEs showed covalent modifications and damages to both cellular protein and plasmid DNA, likely through oxidative pathways mediated by singlet oxygen and subsequent reactive oxygen species sensitized by the CPE and OPE compounds. Our finding thus show that the antimicrobial polymers and oligomers exert toxicity toward Gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the morphology and structures of cell envelope and cytoplasm, including cellular components such as proteins and DNA, while exert toxicity toward Gram-positive bacteria by binding to and disrupting just the cell wall.
TI  - Evaluation of biocidal efficacy of copper alloy coatings in comparison with solid metal surfaces: generation of organic copper phosphate nanoflowers.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the biocidal efficacy of thermal sprayed copper surfaces. METHODS AND RESULTS: Copper alloy sheet metals containing >60% copper have been shown to exhibit potent biocidal activity. Surface biocidal activity was assessed by epifluorescence microscopy. After 2-h exposure at 20 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), contact killing of Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis by brass sheet metal and phosphor bronze was 3-4-times higher than that by stainless steel. SEM observations revealed that the surface membranes of both bacterial strains were slightly more irregular when exposed to brass sheet metal than stainless steel. However, when exposed to phosphor bronze coating, E. coli were 3-4 times larger with irregular membrane morphology. In addition, the majority of the cells were associated with spherical carbon-copper-phosphate crystalline nanostructures characteristic of nanoflowers. The membranes of many of the S. epidermidis exhibited blebbing, and a small subset was also associated with nanoflowers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that increasing the surface roughness of copper alloys had a pronounced impact on the membrane integrity of Gram-positive and, to a lesser degree, Gram-negative bacteria. In the presence of PBS, carbon-copper-phosphate-containing nanoflowers were formed, likely nucleated by components derived from killed bacteria. The intimate association of the bacteria with the nanoflowers and phosphor bronze coating likely contributed to their nonreversible adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Thermal spraying of copper alloys provides a strategy for the rapid coating of three-dimensional organic and inorganic surfaces with biocidal copper alloys. Our study demonstrates that the macroscale surface roughness generated by the thermal spray process enhances the biocidal activity of copper alloys compared with the nanoscale surface roughness of copper sheet metals. Moreover, the coating surface topography provides conditions for the rapid formation of organic copper phosphate nanocrystals/nanoflowers.
TI  - Effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  - Bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. In this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. The bacteria investigated were three Gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, and two Gram-positive species Staphylcoccus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but S. epidermidis on both glass and OTS-modified glass. For S. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on OTS-modified glass but not on glass. Studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. The following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. Results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. Rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa PAO1 but not the growth of E. coli, P. putida and P. aeruginosa E0340. Also, rhamnolipids tended to increase the hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of P. putida and S. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of B. subtillis. These trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. The responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.
TI  - Microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  - Sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). The present investigation characterized microbial recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (AB) and nonabsorbable (NAB) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. AB and NAB sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. At explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. Suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. A significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (P < 0.05) was noted. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected devices. No significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. Biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (P < 0.042). We conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. Further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.
TI  - Wound repair and anti-inflammatory potential of Lonicera japonica in excision wound-induced rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lonicera japonica Thunb. (Caprifoliaceae), a widely used traditional  Chinese medicinal plant, is used to treat some infectious diseases and it may have uses as a healthy food and applications in cosmetics and as an ornamental groundcover. The ethanol extract of the flowering aerial parts of L. japonica (LJEE) was investigated for its healing efficiency in a rat excision wound model. METHODS: Excision wounds were inflicted upon three groups of eight rats each. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction in skin wound sites in rats treated with simple ointment base, 10% (w/w) LJEE ointment, or the reference standard drug, 0.2% (w/w) nitrofurazone ointment. The effects of LJEE on the contents of hydroxyproline and hexosamine during healing were estimated. The antimicrobial activity of LJEE against microorganisms was also assessed. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of LJEE was investigated to understand the mechanism of wound healing. RESULTS: LJEE exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. The ointment formulation prepared with 10% (w/w) LJEE exhibited potent wound healing capacity as evidenced by the wound contraction in the excision wound model. The contents of hydroxyproline and hexosamine also correlated with the observed healing pattern. These findings were supported by the histopathological characteristics of healed wound sections, as greater tissue regeneration, more fibroblasts, and angiogenesis were observed in the 10% (w/w) LJEE ointment-treated group. The results also indicated that LJEE possesses potent anti-inflammatory activity, as it enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines that suppress proinflammatory cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of LJEE act synergistically to accelerate wound repair.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of antimicrobial agents based on pyridazine moiety.
AB  - An efficient and simple microwave assisted synthesis of sulfonamide derivatives incorporating the pyridazine moiety has been developed. These sulfonamides were used for the preparation of new heterocyclic compounds via reaction with different reagents using a microwave irradiation technique. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of FTIR, (1)H and (13)C-NMR, mass spectral techniques and elemental analyses. Some of the new synthesized compounds were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. Most of the new compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of blended essential oil preparation.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of two blended essential oil preparations comprising lavender oil, petigrain oil, clary sage oil, ylang ylang oil and jasmine oil were evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms. Both preparations showed antimicrobial activity in the agar disc diffusion assay against the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 and S. epidermidis isolated strain, the fungus, Candida albicans ATCC10231, and the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, but showed no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these preparations was evaluated. By the broth microdilution assay, preparation 1, comprising lavender oil, clary sage oil, and ylang ylang oil (volume ratio 3:4:3), exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than preparation 2, which was composed of petigrain oil, clary sage oil, and jasmine oil (volume ratio 3:4:3). Moreover, the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations (Sigma fic) of preparation 1 expressed a synergistic antimicrobial effect against the tested microorganisms (Sigma fic<l). The blended essential oil preparations, characterized for their components by GC/MS, contained linalyl acetate, and linalool as major components. Our experiments showed that the differential antimicrobial effect of either blended oil preparations or single/pure essential oils may be influenced by the amount of linalool and linalyl acetate, and the number of active components in either the blended preparations or single/pure essential oils. In addition, blended oil preparations expressed synergistic antimicrobial effect by the accumulation of active components such as linalool and linalyl acetate and combining active constituents of more than one oil.
TI  - A novel role for lipid droplets in the organismal antibacterial response.
AB  - We previously discovered histones bound to cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs); here we show that this forms a cellular antibacterial defense system. Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into Drosophila embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. Our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00003.001.
TI  - A novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. Fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. We selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. Here, we demonstrate that the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus A170, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi, Escherichia coli, and Helicobacter pylori. In addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against THP-1 cells. Finally, SolyC exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
TI  - Surface modification of silicone for biomedical applications requiring long-term  antibacterial, antifouling, and hemocompatible properties.
AB  - Silicone has been used for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters for several decades. However, bacteria, platelets, proteins, and other biomolecules tend to adhere to its hydrophobic surface, which may lead to PD outflow failure, serious infection, or even death. In this work, a cross-linked poly(poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate) (P(PEGDMA)) polymer layer was covalently grafted on medical-grade silicone surface to improve its antibacterial and antifouling properties. The P(PEGDMA)-grafted silicone (Silicone-g-P(PEGDMA)) substrate reduced the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus epidermidis , as well as 3T3 fibroblast cells by >/=90%. The antibacterial and antifouling properties were preserved after the modified substrate was aged for 30 days in phosphate buffer saline. Further immobilization of a polysulfobetaine polymer, poly((2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide) (P(DMAPS)), on the Silicone-g-P(PEGDMA) substrate via thiol-ene click reaction leads to enhanced antifouling efficacy and improved hemocompatibility with the preservation of the antibacterial property. Compared to pristine silicone, the so-obtained Silicone-g-P(PEGDMA)-P(DMAPS) substrate reduced the absorption of bovine serum albumin and bovine plasma fibrinogen by >/=80%. It also reduced the number of adherent platelets by >/=90% and significantly prolonged plasma recalcification time. The results indicate that surface grafting with P(PEGDMA) and P(DMAPS) can be potentially useful for the modification of silicone-based PD catheters for long-term applications.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Surface-grafted polysarcosine as a peptoid antifouling polymer brush.
AB  - Poly(N-substituted glycine) "peptoids" are a class of peptidomimetic molecules receiving significant interest as engineered biomolecules. Sarcosine (i.e., poly(N-methyl glycine)) has the simplest side chain chemical structure of this family. In this Article, we demonstrate that surface-grafted polysarcosine (PSAR) brushes exhibit excellent resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption and cell attachment. Polysarcosine was coupled to a mussel adhesive protein-inspired DOPA-Lys pentapeptide, which enabled solution grafting and control of the surface chain density of the PSAR brushes. Protein adsorption was found to decrease monotonically with increasing grafted chain densities, and protein adsorption could be completely inhibited above certain critical chain densities specific to different polysarcosine chain lengths. The dependence of protein adsorption on chain length and density was also investigated by a molecular theory. PSAR brushes at high chain length and density were shown to resist fibroblast cell attachment over a 7 week period, as well as resist the attachment of some clinically relevant bacterial strains. The excellent antifouling performance of PSAR may be related to the highly hydrophilic character of polysarcosine, which was evident from high-pressure liquid chromatography measurements of polysarcosine and water contact angle measurements of the PSAR brushes. Peptoids have been shown to resist proteolytic degradation, and polysarcosine could be produced in large quantities by N-carboxy anhydride polymerization. In summary, surface-grafted polysarcosine peptoid brushes hold great promise for antifouling applications.
TI  - Genotypic diversity and virulent factors of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from human breast milk.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were isolated from the expressed human breast  milk (EHM) of 14 healthy donor mothers. Genetic diversity was evaluated using RAPD-PCR REP-PCR and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE allowed the best discrimination of the isolates, since it provided for the greatest diversity of the analyzed genomes. Among the S. epidermidis strains, resistance to gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin or vancomycin was detected, whilst four isolates were multiresistant. The results from our study demonstrate that staphylococci from EHM could be reservoirs of resistance genes, since we showed that tetK could be transferred from EHM staphylococci to Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Most of the staphylococcal strains displayed excellent proteolytic and lipolytic activities. Additionally, the presence of ica genes, which was related to their ability to form a biofilm on tissue culture plates, and the presence of virulence factors including autolysin/adhesin AtLE, point to their pathogenic potential.
TI  - Peptidoglycan hydrolases-potential weapons against Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are common pathogens responsible for a broad spectrum of human and animal infections and belong to the most important etiological factors causing food poisoning. Because of rapid increase in the prevalence of isolation of staphylococci resistant to many antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the development of new alternative chemotherapeutics. A number of studies have recently demonstrated the strong potential of peptidoglycan hydrolases (PHs) to control and treat infections caused by this group of bacteria. PHs cause rapid lysis and death of bacterial cells. The review concentrates on enzymes hydrolyzing peptidoglycan of staphylococci. Usually, they are characterized by high specificity to only Staphylococcus aureus cell wall components; however, some of them are also able to lyse cells of other staphylococci, e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis-human pathogen of growing importance and also other groups of bacteria. Some PHs strengthen the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of common antibiotics, and as a result, they should be considered as component of combined therapy which could definitely reduced the development of bacterial resistance to both enzymes and antibiotics. The preliminary research revealed that most of these enzymes can be produced using heterologous, especially Escherichia coli expression systems; however, still much effort is required to develop more efficient and large-scale production technologies. This review discusses current state on knowledge with emphasis on the possibilities of application of PHs in the context of therapeutics for infections caused by staphylococci.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Full and broad-spectrum in vivo eradication of catheter-associated biofilms using gentamicin-EDTA antibiotic lock therapy.
AB  - Biofilms that develop on indwelling devices are a major concern in clinical settings. While removal of colonized devices remains the most frequent strategy for avoiding device-related complications, antibiotic lock therapy constitutes an adjunct therapy for catheter-related infection. However, currently used antibiotic lock solutions are not fully effective against biofilms, thus warranting a search for new antibiotic locks. Metal-binding chelators have emerged as potential adjuvants due to their dual anticoagulant/antibiofilm activities, but studies investigating their efficiency were mainly in vitro or else focused on their effects in prevention of infection. To assess the ability of such chelators to eradicate mature biofilms, we used an in vivo model of a totally implantable venous access port inserted in rats and colonized by either Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that use of tetrasodium EDTA (30 mg/ml) as a supplement to the gentamicin (5 mg/ml) antibiotic lock solution associated with systemic antibiotics completely eradicated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms developed in totally implantable venous access ports. Gentamicin-EDTA lock was able to eliminate biofilms with a single instillation, thus reducing length of treatment. Moreover, we show that this combination was effective for immunosuppressed rats. Lastly, we demonstrate that a gentamicin-EDTA lock is able to eradicate the biofilm formed by a gentamicin-resistant strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. This in vivo study demonstrates the potential of EDTA as an efficient antibiotic adjuvant to eradicate catheter-associated biofilms of major bacterial pathogens and thus provides a promising new lock solution.
TI  - Biofilm infections, their resilience to therapy and innovative treatment strategies.
AB  - Biofilm formation of microorganisms causes persistent tissue and foreign body infections resistant to treatment with antimicrobial agents. Up to 80% of human bacterial infections are biofilm associated; such infections are most frequently caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. The accurate diagnosis of biofilm infections is often difficult, which prevents the appropriate choice of treatment. As biofilm infections significantly contribute to patient morbidity and substantial healthcare costs, novel strategies to treat these infections are urgently required. Nucleotide second messengers, c-di-GMP, (p)ppGpp and potentially c-di-AMP, are major regulators of biofilm formation and associated antibiotic tolerance. Consequently, different components of these signalling networks might be appropriate targets for antibiofilm therapy in combination with antibiotic treatment strategies. In addition, cyclic di-nucleotides are microbial-associated molecular patterns with an almost universal presence. Their conserved structures sensed by the eukaryotic host have a widespread effect on the immune system. Thus, cyclic di-nucleotides are also potential immunotherapeutic agents to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Absence of bactericidal effect of focused shock waves on an in-vitro biofilm model of an implant.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal effect of shock waves (SWs) on gram-negative or gram-positive monocultured biofilms grown on an orthopedic implant in vitro. Cortical bone screws were individually cultured with Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis to produce a biofilm. In each run of 8 screws, 6 screws were treated with shock waves and then sonicated to disrupt the biofilm. One screw was sonicated only and one was not shock waved or sonicated before sampling for plate count dilutions. Post-treatment serial dilutions and plate counts were done on an aliquot from the vial containing each screw to obtain the number of colony-forming units (CFUs). Shock waves were at a constant energy of 0.15 mJ/mm(2). Pulse number and screw orientation were varied. A linear mixed-effects model was used with "treatment" as a fixed effect and "run" as a random effect. Pairwise comparisons of treatments were performed with Tukey-Cramer's adjustment for P-values. Sonicated plate counts were greater than nonsonicated counts for each run. When all sonicated screws were compared to all nonsonicated screws, the counts were significantly increased (P = 0.0091). For each paired comparison between sonicated and shock wave treatment, the only significant difference was in the S. epidermidis biofilm treated at 2000 pulses in a horizontal position, which increased the post-treatment count (P = 0.0445). No bactericidal effects were seen on monocultured biofilms on cortical bone screws treated with shock waves.
TI  - Aerobic vaginitis and mixed infections: comparison of clinical and laboratory findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and mixed infections with AV to achieve efficient diagnosis. METHODS: From April 2008 to August 2009, 657 consecutive outpatients with vaginal symptoms in gynecology clinic in the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University were investigated. Samples were taken for examination of vaginal discharge and fresh wet mount microscopy. AV, bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomonal vaginitis (TV) were diagnosed according to standardized definitions. Sixty patients with single AV were randomly selected over the same period. Each patient accepted moxifloxacin therapy. Two kinds of treatment course (400 mg qd, 6 days or 400 mg qd, 12 days) were given. Clinical features and laboratory test results in the first visit and follow-ups were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULT: Among the 657 cases, AV was found in 23.74 % of the cases (156/657). AV mixed infections were diagnosed in 53.85 % (84/156): the mixed infections included VVC (32/84, 38.10 %), BV (31/84, 36.90 %), and TV (21/84, 25.00 %). Common symptoms of AV were a change in the characteristics of the discharge (44/72, 61.11 %) and increased discharge (30/72, 41.67 %). Vaginal pH was usually higher than 4.5 (63/72, 87.50 %). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated. There is no statistically significant difference between two moxifloxacin treatment groups (p > 0.05). Cure rate was 89.7 % in 6-day group, and 71.4 % in 12-day group. CONCLUSIONS: AV is a common vaginal infection, and it is often mixed with other infections, especially VVC, BV and TV. The symptoms and signs of AV mixed infections are atypical. If a patient has vaginal complaints, it is necessary to determine whether AV or mixed infections are present. Oral moxifloxacin is effective in treating AV, and an appropriate course should be selected taking the severity of AV into consideration.
TI  - Effects of sterilization with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, ethylene oxide, and steam on bioadhesive properties of nylon and polyethylene lines used for stabilization of canine stifle joints.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of sterilization with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma  (HPGP), ethylene oxide, and steam on bioadhesive properties of nylon and polyethylene lines used for stabilization of canine stifle joints. SAMPLE: Samples of a 36.3-kg test nylon leader line, 57.8-kg test nylon fishing line, and 2-mm ultrahigh-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were used. PROCEDURES: In this in vitro study, samples of nylon leader line, fishing line, and UHMWPE sterilized by use of HPGP, ethylene oxide, and steam or unsterilized samples were used. Bacterial adherence on unsterilized and sterilized samples was tested with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Five samples were examined for each line type and sterilization condition, and final colony counts were obtained. RESULTS: Bacterial adherence was significantly affected by method of sterilization for all 3 line types. For most of the samples, bacterial adherence was similar or lower when HPGP sterilization was used, compared with results for sterilization via ethylene oxide and steam, respectively. Bacterial adherence was significantly higher for UHMWPE, compared with adherence for the nylon line, regardless of the sterilization method used. Bacterial adherence was higher for nylon fishing line than for nylon leader line for S epidermidis after ethylene oxide sterilization and for E coli after HPGP and ethylene oxide sterilization. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Effects of HPGP sterilization on bioadhesive properties of nylon and polyethylene lines compared favorably with those for ethylene oxide and steam sterilization. Also, nylon line may be a more suitable material than UHMWPE for suture prostheses on the basis of bacterial adherence properties.
TI  - Carbon nanotube-based antimicrobial biomaterials formed via layer-by-layer assembly with polypeptides.
AB  - Biomaterials capable of suppressing microbial infection are of clear importance in various health care applications, e.g. implantable devices. In this study, we investigate the antimicrobial activity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled with the polyelectrolytes poly(L-lysine) (PLL) and poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA). SWNT dispersion in aqueous solution is achieved through the biocompatible nonionic surfactant polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), and the amphiphilic polymer phospholipid-poly(ethylene glycol) (PL-PEG). Absorbance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show SWNT with either Tween 20 or PL-PEG in aqueous solution to be well dispersed, at about the level of SWNT in chloroform. Quartz crystal microgravimetry with dissipation (QCMD) measurements show both SWNT-Tween and SWNT-PL-PEG to LbL assemble with PLL and PGA into multilayer films, with the PL-PEG system yielding the greater final SWNT content. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis inactivation rates are significantly higher (up to 90%) upon 24h incubation with SWNT containing films, compared to control films (ca. 20%). This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of SWNT/PLL/PGA thin films as antimicrobial biomaterials.
TI  - A novel methylated sesquiterpene from seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of chloroform extract from the leaves of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (Posidoniaceae), yielded posidozinol, a new methylated sesquiterpene along with beta-sitosterol and four known fatty acids: palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids. The structure elucidation has been established on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, GS/MS and ES mass spectrometry. Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.
TI  - Decreased bacteria activity on Si(3)N(4) surfaces compared with PEEK or titanium.
AB  - A significant need exists for orthopedic implants that can intrinsically resist bacterial colonization. In this study, three biomaterials that are used in spinal implants--titanium (Ti), polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), and silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4))--were tested to understand their respective susceptibility to bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphlococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Specifically, the surface chemistry, wettability, and nanostructured topography of respective biomaterials, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation, colonization, and growth were investigated. Ti and PEEK were received with as-machined surfaces; both materials are hydrophobic, with net negative surface charges. Two surface finishes of Si(3)N(4) were examined: as-fired and polished. In contrast to Ti and PEEK, the surface of Si(3)N(4) is hydrophilic, with a net positive charge. A decreased biofilm formation was found, as well as fewer live bacteria on both the as-fired and polished Si(3)N(4). These differences may reflect differential surface chemistry and surface nanostructure properties between the biomaterials tested. Because protein adsorption on material surfaces affects bacterial adhesion, the adsorption of fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin on Ti, PEEK, and Si(3)N(4) were also examined. Significantly greater amounts of these proteins adhered to Si(3)N(4) than to Ti or PEEK. The findings of this study suggest that surface properties of biomaterials lead to differential adsorption of physiologic proteins, and that this phenomenon could explain the observed in-vitro differences in bacterial affinity for the respective biomaterials. Intrinsic biomaterial properties as they relate to resistance to bacterial colonization may reflect a novel strategy toward designing future orthopedic implants.
TI  - Chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the leaf essential oil of Juglans regia L. and its constituents.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Juglans regia L. (Juglandaceae) growing wild in Kashmir (India) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by a combination of capillary GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of 38 compounds, representing 92.7% of the oil, were identified and the major components were found to be alpha-pinene (15.1%), beta-pinene (30.5%), beta-caryophyllene (15.5%) germacrene D (14.4%) and limonene (3.6%). The essential oil and the main individual constituents were screened for antibacterial activity and the essential oil evaluated for antioxidant activity. Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion and microdilution methods against a group of clinically significant Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC-435, Bacillus subtilis MTCC-441, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Proteus vulgaris MTCC-321, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC-1688, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dyssenteriae, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli). The essential oil and its major components exhibited broad spectrum inhibition against all the bacterial strains with Gram-positive being more susceptible to the oil than Gram-negative bacteria. Antioxidant activity of the oil was evaluated by the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and hydroxyl radicals. In general, the essential oil exhibited high antioxidant activity which was comparable to the reference standards at the same dose (ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyl toluene, BHT) with IC(50) values of 34.5 and 56.4mug/ml calculated by DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays respectively.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - The use of MALDI-TOF-MS and in silico studies for determination of antimicrobial  peptides' affinity to bacterial cells.
AB  - Several methods have been proposed for determining the binding affinity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to bacterial cells. Here the utilization of MALDI-TOF-MS was proposed as a reliable and efficient method for high throughput AMP screening. The major advantage of the technique consists of finding AMPs that are selective and specific to a wide range of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, providing a simple reliable screening tool to determine the potential candidates for broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs. As a prototype, amp-1 and -2 were used, showing highest activity toward Gram-negative and -positive membranes respectively. In addition, in silico molecular docking studies with both peptides were carried out for the membranes. In silico results indicated that both peptides presented affinity for DPPG and DPPE phospholipids, constructed in order to emulate an in vivo membrane bilayer. As a result, amp-1 showed a higher complementary surface for Gram-negative while amp-2 showed higher affinity to Gram-positive membranes, corroborating MS analyses. In summary, results here obtained suggested that in vitro methodology using MALDI-TOF-MS in addition to theoretical studies may be able to improve AMP screening quality.
TI  - Genetic manipulation of Staphylococci-breaking through the barrier.
AB  - Most strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis possess a strong restriction barrier that hinders exchange of DNA. Recently, major advances have been made in identifying and characterizing the restriction-modification (RM) systems involved. In particular a novel type IV restriction enzyme that recognizes cytosine methylated DNA has been shown to be the major barrier to transfer of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli into S. aureus and S. epidermidis. While the conserved type I RM system provides a further barrier. Here we review the recent advances in understanding of restriction systems in staphylococci and highlight how this has been exploited to improve our ability to manipulate genetically previously untransformable strains.
TI  - Chemical composition and in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial and anti-acetylcholinesterase properties of the flower oil of Ferula lutea.
AB  - The present work describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antimicrobial and the anti-acetylcholinesterase properties of the flower oil from the Tunisian Ferula lutea obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of GC/FID and GC/MS. The chemical composition of the flower oil of this species is reported for the first time. Seventeen compounds were identified accounting for 94.3% of the total oil. The chemical composition of this essential oil was characterized by a high proportion of monoterpene hydrocarbons (80.4%) among which delta-3-carene (31.2%) and alpha-pinene (25.8%) were the predominant compounds. The oxygenated monoterpenes represent the second major fraction (12.0%), 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (10.9%) being the predominant one. Furthermore, the isolated oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity using the disc-diffusion and the microdilution assays against six Gram-positive and five Gram-negative bacteria as well as towards eight Candida species. It was found that flower oil of F. lutea exhibited interesting antibacterial and anticandidal activity (MIC = 39 mcirog/mL against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and MIC = 156 microg/mL against Candida albicans). The anti-acetylcholinesterase effect of this oil was also evaluated in this work. Results showed that this oil exhibits significant activity (IC50 =70.25 +/- 5.41 microg/mL).
TI  - DNA binding mode of novel tetradentate amino acid based 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine complexes.
AB  - Few transition metal complexes of tetradentate N(2)O(2) donor Schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to KHL(1)/KHL(2) have been synthesized. All the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The Schiff bases KHL(1)/KHL(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. The binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus DNA have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. The DNA binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with DNA through minor groove binding mode. The studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. The Schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani, Culvularia lunata, Rhizoctonia bataicola and Candida albicans by MIC method.
TI  - Dose findings of antofloxacin hydrochloride for treating bacterial infections in  an early clinical trial using PK-PD parameters in healthy volunteers.
AB  - AIM: To find an appropriate dose regimen of the novel antibacterial agent antofloxacin for a phase II clinical trial using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) study in healthy volunteers and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind crossover study and received antofloxacin (200 or 400 mg/d, po) for consecutive 5 d with 10 d washout between two separate periods. Blood concentrations were analyzed using HPLC with a UV-Vis detector. The values of area under the curve (AUC) with covariates were obtained from a PPK model, and the MICs came from the previous in vitro studies. The dose regimen was determined for the phase II clinical trial according to the ratio (>20) of AUC/MIC, and the efficacy of the dose was evaluated by the trial. RESULTS: A two-compartment model best described the time-concentration data with first-order absorption. The PPK parameter estimates for CL, V(c), Q, V(p) and K(A) are 8.34 L/h, 142 L, 15.9 L/h, 52.2 L and 4.64 1/h, respectively. The covariates sex for K(A), weight for CL, weight for V(c) and interoccasion variability were included in the final model. The AUC/MIC was calculated based on the PPK model and the MIC of antofloxacin for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined in previous researches. The 400 mg loading dose with 200 mg/d maintenance dose was recommended and confirmed by the phase II trial. CONCLUSION: The ratio of AUC from the PPK model vs MIC as the PD parameter can be applied in a dose-finding trial of antofloxacin in treatment of bacterial infections. The PPK model suggests that sex and body weight may be considerations in regards to individual therapy, which should be investigated in larger clinical trials and serve as a potential reference for clinical therapies.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of levofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in Chinese patients.
AB  - Levofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone that is usually used to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis. We investigated the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in Chinese patients. This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. Four hundred and seventy-one patients with clinical symptoms/signs were enrolled into the study, and 408 patients were microbiologically confirmed chronic bacterial prostatitis, who were randomized to either oral levofloxacin (500 mg q.d.) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.) for 4 weeks. Bacterial clearance rate, clinical symptoms/signs, adverse reactions and disease recurrence were assessed. The clinical symptoms and signs (including dysuria, perineal discomfort or pain) and bacteria cultures in 209 patients treated with levofloxacin and 199 patients treated with ciprofloxacin were similar. The most common bacteria were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. One to four weeks after the end of 4 weeks treatment, the bacterial clearance rate (86.06% vs. 60.03%; P<0.05) and the clinical efficacy (including clinical cure and clinical improvement(93.30% vs. 71.86%; P<0.05)) were significantly higher in the levofloxacin-treated group than in the ciprofloxacin-treated group. The microbiological recurrence rate was significantly lower in the levofloxacin-treated group than in the ciprofloxacin-treated group (4.00% vs. 19.25%; P<0.05). Rates of adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were slightly lower in the levofloxacin-treated group than in ciprofloxacin-treated group. Levofloxacin showed some advantages over ciprofloxacin in terms of clinical efficacy and disease recurrence, with a low rate of adverse events, for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in Chinese patients.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of dextran-capped silver nanoparticles with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - Dextran-capped silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with NaBH4 in the presence of dextran as capping agent. The characters of silver nanoparticles were investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, nano-grainsize analyzer, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that the silver nanoparticles capped with dextran were in uniform shape and narrow size distribution. Moreover, compared with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped silver nanoparticles, the dextran-capped ones possessed better stability. Antibacterial tests of these silver nanoparticles were carried out for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results suggested that the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles had high antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the cytotoxicity in vitro of the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles was investigated using mouse fibrosarcoma cells (L929). The toxicity was evaluated by the changes of cell morphology and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Results indicated that these silver nanoparticles had slight effect on the survival and proliferation of L-929 cells at their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). After modified by dextran, the physiochemical properties of the silver nanoparticles had been improved. We anticipated that these dextran-capped silver nanoparticles could be integrated into systems for biological and pharmaceutical applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plasma from crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) is a critically endangered species of freshwater crocodiles. Crocodilians live with opportunistic bacterial infection but normally suffer no adverse effects. They are not totally immune to microbial infection, but their resistance thereto is remarkably effective. In this study, crude and purified plasma extracted from the Siamese crocodile were examined for antibacterial activity against clinically isolated, human pathogenic bacterial strains and the related reference strains. METHODS: Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile by differential sedimentation. The crude plasma was examined for antibacterial activity by the liquid growth inhibition assay. The scanning electron microscopy was performed to confirm the effect of crude crocodile plasma on the cells of Salmonella typhi ATCC 11778. Effect of crude crocodile plasma on cell viability was tested by MTT assay. In addition, the plasma was purified by anion exchange column chromatography with DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M and the purified plasma was tested for antibacterial activity. RESULTS: Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile and exhibited substantial antibacterial activities of more than 40% growth inhibition against the six reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the four clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Vibrio cholerae. Especially, more than 80% growth inhibition was found in the reference strains of Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis and in the clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholerae. The effect of the crude plasma on bacterial cells of Salmonella typhi, a certain antibacterial material probably penetrates progressively into the cytoplasmic space, perturbing and damaging bacterial membranes. The effect of the crude plasma was not toxic by the yellow tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using a macrophage-like cell, RAW 264.7. The pooled four fractions, designated as fractions D1-D4, were obtained by column chromatography, and only fraction D1 showed growth inhibition in the reference strains and the clinical, human pathogenic isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The crude and purified plasma from the Siamese crocodile significantly showed antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria and reference strains by damage cell membrane of target bacterial cells. From the MTT assay, the Siamese crocodile plasma was not cytotoxic to the cells.
TI  - Comparison of real-time PCR and MassTag PCR for the multiplex detection of highly pathogenic agents.
AB  - Multiplex PCR assays are a cost- as well as labour-effective way to analyse one sample for several pathogens simultaneously. Besides the mutual competition of the individual PCR reactions included in a multiplex PCR assay, their specific read-out displays a limiting factor for the total number of PCR reactions that can be multiplexed. In this study, two PCR systems with different read-out approaches are compared, using a pentaplex PCR assay for the detection of highly pathogenic agents. A pentaplex assay was used since five represents the current limit of real-time PCR multiplexing capacity due to the low resolution of fluorescence emission peaks of the current equipment. In contrast, MassTag PCR as a quite new technique offers the possibility to detect up to 20-30 target sequences from one reaction. After extensive and separate optimisation of the PCR protocol for both platforms, a comparative probit analysis showed good sensitivities for MassTag and real-time PCR detection. Nevertheless, the detection limits of MassTag PCR have been undercut by the real-time PCR for each target. We therefore conclude that MassTag PCR is a useful diagnostic technique for the sensitive screening for pathogens by highly multiplexed PCR assays, but cannot reach the sensitivity of real-time PCR for lower multiplexed PCR assays.
TI  - Incidence and risk factors for infection in oral cancer patients undergoing different treatments protocols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in cancer treatments have been counterbalanced by a rising number of immunosuppressed patients with a multitude of new risk factors for infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine risk factors, infectious pathogens in blood and oral cavity of oral cancer patients undergoing different treatment procedures. METHODS: The present prospective cohort analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2007 to October 2009. Total 186 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity were analyzed in the study. Based on treatment procedures patients were divided into three groups, group I were under radiotherapy, group II under chemotherapy and group III were of radio chemotherapy together. Clinical isolates from blood and oral cavity were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus. The predominant gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were isolated from blood of radiotherapy and oral cavity of chemotherapy treated cases respectively. The predominance of gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were observed in blood of chemotherapy, radio chemotherapy cases and oral cavity of radiotherapy, radio chemotherapy treated cases. Our study also revealed the presence of C. albicans fungi as most significant oral cavity pathogens in radiotherapy and radio chemotherapy cases. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative were reported from the blood of all the three groups of patients. Oral mucositis played a significant role in oral cavity infection and make patients more prone to C. albicans infection.
TI  - Synthesis of short cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics containing arginine analogues.
AB  - Worldwide efforts are underway to develop new antimicrobial agents against bacterial resistance. To identify new compounds with a good antimicrobial profile, we designed and synthesized two series of small cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (1-8) containing unusual arginine mimetics (to introduce cationic charges) and several aromatic amino acids (bulky moieties to improve lipophilicity). Both series were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against a representative panel of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial strains, and Candida albicans. The biological screening showed that peptidomimetics containing tryptophan residues are endowed with the best antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis in respect to the other synthesized derivatives (MIC values range 7.5-50 microg/ml). Moreover, small antimicrobial peptidomimetics derivatives 2 and 5 showed an appreciable activity against the tested Gram-negative bacteria and C. albicans. The most active compounds (1-2 and 5-6) have been tested against Gram-positive established biofilm, too. Results showed that the biofilm inhibitory concentration values of these compounds were never up to 200 microg/ml. The replacement of tryptophan with phenylalanine or tyrosine resulted in considerable loss of the antibacterial action (compounds 3-4 and 7-8) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Furthermore, by evaluating hemolytic activity, the synthesized compounds did not reveal cytotoxic activities, except for compound 5.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - The drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in Korea. Therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in Korea. A total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 Escherichia coli, 60 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 Enterococcus faecalis, 27 Citrobacter freundii, 35 Acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of ICR mice and SD rats. Of these species, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in E-test. In case of Acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed MIC values 16-128 microg/mL for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/mL) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. Resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. In addition, 44.1% of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/mL range, while MIC value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/mL. These results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, Acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of Enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in a pediatric intensive care unit of a developing country: NHSN surveillance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the epidemiology of the three most common nosocomial infections (NI), namely, sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a developing country and to define the risk factors associated with NI. METHODS: We performed a prospective study on the incidence of NI in a single PICU, between August 2009 and August 2010. Active surveillance by National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was conducted in the unit and children with NI (cases) were compared with a group (matched controls) in a case-control fashion. RESULTS: We analyzed 172 patients; 22.1% had NI, 71.1% of whom acquired it in the unit. The incidence densities of sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI per 1,000 patients/day were 17.9, 11.4, and 4.3, respectively. The most common agents in sepsis were Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (18% each); Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 13% of cases. In pneumonias Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause (3.2%), and in UTI the most frequent agents were yeasts (33.3%). The presence of NI was associated with a long period of hospitalization, use of invasive devices (central venous catheter, nasogastric tube), and use of antibiotics. The last two were independent factors for NI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NI acquired in this unit was high and was associated with extrinsic factors.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Causative bacteria and antibiotic resistance in neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by Escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. Acinetobacter species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebseila, Streptococci, Enterobacter cloacae and Morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. In most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). There was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. Gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). Quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. Vancomycin was found to be effective in 100% cases of Staphylococcus group. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and Escherichia coli are the most common gram negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. Continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Infections from CVC in the pediatric neoplastic patient. Single institution experience.
AB  - AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
TI  - Report: Studies on antibacterial activity of some traditional medicinal plants used in folk medicine.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of eight medicinal plants commonly used in folk medicine were  tested for their antibacterial activity against four Gram positive strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and six Gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B and Shigella dysenteriae) that were obtained from different pathological laboratories located in Karachi, Pakistan. Disc diffusion method was used to analyze antibacterial activity. Out of eight, five medicinal plants showed antibacterial activity against two or more than two microbial species. The most effective antimicrobial plant found to be Punica granatum followed by Curcuma zedoaria Rosc, Grewia asiatica L and Carissa carandas L, Curcuma caesia Roxb respectively. From these results, it is evident that medicinal plants could be used as a potential source of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants.
AB  - Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants extracts were studied for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis (NCTC 11047) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (NCTC 13143) and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani. Extracts were obtained by using methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction. The extracts of Paeonia emodi and Aerva javanica showed significant antibacterial activity but only Salmonella typhi was resistant to Aerva javanica. Moreover, the antifungal activity of Aerva javanica was very poor but the fractions of Paeonia emodi showed sufficient inhibition against fungal strains.
TI  - Does dithiothreitol improve bacterial detection from infected prostheses? A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sonication and scraping of infected prostheses usually are used to improve diagnosis of prosthetic infections, reducing false negatives. Chemical methods that reduce biofilms also may allow higher levels of detection. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore asked: (1) Do dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) remove bacteria from biofilm formed on prosthetic materials? (2) Is bacterial recovery affected by differing DTT and NAC concentrations and incubation times? (3) Do treatments with DTT and NAC detach the same amounts of bacteria from biofilm on prosthetic materials as sonication and scraping? (4) Are these methods reproducible? METHODS: We treated polyethylene and titanium discs covered by biofilm formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with DTT or NAC solutions at different concentrations for different times. We compared colony counts of S aureus, P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli after treatment with NAC, DTT, sonication and scraping. We determined colony counts after treatment of biofilm formed by one strain of S aureus and one of P aeruginosa on five discs of each material analyzed on the same day and on five discs analyzed on five consecutive days. RESULTS: Mean colony counts (LogCFU/mL) obtained after treatment with 1 g/L DTT for 15 minutes (5.3) were similar to those after sonication (4.9) and greater than those obtaining by scraping (3.4) and treatment with 2 g/L NAC for 30 minutes (1.9). DTT and sonication showed good reproducibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our data suggest that treatment of prostheses with DTT may be a reasonable alternative to sonication to improve detection of biofilm-associated bacteria and supplement conventional laboratory culturing techniques for diagnosing periprosthetic infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2010].
AB  - We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
TI  - Comparison of microplate and macrodilution methods in time-kill study of new antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - In consideration of high production costs of new antimicrobial drugs, a more convenient and economical method for time-kill study is urgently required. In the present experiment, we attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of microplate method as an alternative measure of macrodilution method for time-kill study. Three conventional antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin) and two antimicrobial peptides [A-thanatin and K(4)-S4(1-16)a] were used to determine time-kill curves against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990. Meanwhile, both methods were also performed with three antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNA3, PNA4, and PNA5) targeting ropD gene of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and MRSA WHO-2. In order to study the correlation between the two methods, the growth inhibition rate of PNAs, antimicrobial peptides, and antibiotics for the tested strains were evaluated. A strong agreement between the results obtained from the two methods has been demonstrated. Although microplate method required longer incubation time for a significant result than macrodilution method, the former provides a more convenient, economical, and stable way to perform time-kill test for these agents. Thus, we concluded that microplate method was an available measure for time-kill study of new antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - IgG opsonization of bacteria promotes Th17 responses via synergy between TLRs and FcgammaRIIa in human dendritic cells.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in inducing adaptive immune responses against bacteria by expressing cytokines that skew T-cell responses toward protective Th17 cells. Although it is widely recognized that induction of these cytokines by DCs involves activation of multiple receptors, it is still incompletely characterized which combination of receptors specifically skews Th17-cell responses. Here we have identified a novel role for FcgammaRIIa in promoting human Th17 cells. Activation of DCs by bacteria opsonized by serum IgG strongly promoted Th17 responses, which was FcgammaRIIa-dependent and coincided with enhanced production of selected cytokines by DCs, including Th17-promoting IL-1beta and IL-23. Notably, FcgammaRIIa stimulation on DCs did not induce cytokine production when stimulated individually, but selectively amplified cytokine responses through synergy with TLR2, 4, or 5. Importantly, this synergy is mediated at 2 different levels. First, TLR-FcgammaRIIa costimulation strongly increased transcription of pro-IL-1beta and IL-23p19. Second, FcgammaRIIa triggering induced activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1beta into its bioactive form and thereby enhanced IL-1beta secretion. Taken together, these data identified cross-talk between TLRs and FcgammaRIIa as a novel mechanism by which DCs promote protective effector Th17-cell responses against bacteria.
TI  - [Advances in the study of synergistic effect of anti-biofilm agents].
AB  - Biofilms are communities of surface-associated bacteria or fungi embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix that are notoriously difficult to be eradicated and are sources of many recalcitrant infections. Treatment for biofilm infection with any individual drug is always less effective, while the combinations of different types of drugs are superior to monotherapy concerning the removing of biofilms. This paper focus on research progress in recent years for synergistic effect of drugs in combination against biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.
TI  - Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of the methanolic extract of Geum iranicum and  its main compounds.
AB  - Geum iranicum Khatamsaz, belonging to the Rosaceae family, is an endemic plant of Iran. The methanol extract of the roots of this plant showed significant activity against one of the clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori which was resistant to metronidazole. The aim of this study was the isolation and evaluation of the major compounds of G. iranicum effective against H. pylori. The compounds were isolated using various chromatographic methods and identified by spectroscopic data (1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, EI-MS). An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed employing the disk diffusion method against clinical isolates of H. pylori and a micro dilution method against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; additionally the inhibition zone diameters (IZD) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were recorded. Nine compounds were isolated: two triterpenoids, uvaol and niga-ichigoside F1, three sterols, beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosteryl acetate, and beta-sitosteryl linoleate, one phenyl propanoid, eugenol, one phenolic glycoside, gein, one flavanol, (+)-catechin, and sucrose. The aqueous fraction, obtained by partitioning the MeOH extract with water and chloroform, was the most effective fraction of the extract against all clinical isolates of H. pylori. Further investigation of the isolated compounds showed that eugenol was effective against H. pylori but gein, diglycosidic eugenol, did not exhibit any activity against H. pylori. The subfraction D4 was the effective fraction which contained tannins. It appeared that tannins were probably the active compounds responsible for the anti-H. pylori activity of G. iranicum. The aqueous fraction showed a moderate inhibitory activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC values indicated that Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis are more susceptible than Gram-neagative bacteria including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A rat model of central venous catheter to study establishment of long-term bacterial biofilm and related acute and chronic infections.
AB  - Formation of resilient biofilms on medical devices colonized by pathogenic microorganisms is a major cause of health-care associated infection. While in vitro biofilm analyses led to promising anti-biofilm approaches, little is known about their translation to in vivo situations and on host contribution to the in vivo dynamics of infections on medical devices. Here we have developed an in vivo model of long-term bacterial biofilm infections in a pediatric totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) surgically placed in adult rats. Using non-invasive and quantitative bioluminescence, we studied TIVAP contamination by clinically relevant pathogens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and we demonstrated that TIVAP bacterial populations display typical biofilm phenotypes. In our study, we showed that immunocompetent rats were able to control the colonization and clear the bloodstream infection except for up to 30% that suffered systemic infection and death whereas none of the immunosuppressed rats survived the infection. Besides, we mimicked some clinically relevant TIVAP associated complications such as port-pocket infection and hematogenous route of colonization. Finally, by assessing an optimized antibiotic lock therapy, we established that our in vivo model enables to assess innovative therapeutic strategies against bacterial biofilm infections.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  - Flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. In this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived platelet concentrates (PCs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. Five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were used. Platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) CFUs per mL; 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, and 2.0 mL aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. During the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. We could detect a low concentration (10 CFUs per mL) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 mL) of PCs. Irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli were 16 hours or less. A higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. The numbers of detected bacteria increased during the incubation. However, the graphs corresponding to K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. The incubation of small volumes of PC with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. Therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using PRP-derived PCs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.
TI  - Moderate intensity static magnetic field has bactericidal effect on E. coli and S. epidermidis on sintered hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The application of electromagnetic field in the context of bacteria associated infections on biomaterial surfaces has not been extensively explored. In this work, we applied a moderate intensity static magnetic field (100 mT) to understand the adhesion and growth behavior of both gram positive (S. epidermidis) and gram negative bacteria (E. coli) and also to investigate bactericidal/bacteriostatic property of the applied electromagnetic field. An in-house built magnetometer was used to apply static homogeneous magnetic field during a planned set of in vitro experiments. Both the sintered hydroxyapatite (HA) and the control samples seeded with bacteria were exposed to the magnetic field (100 mT) for different timescale during their log phase growth. Quantitative analysis of the SEM images confirms the effect of electromagnetic field on suppressing bacterial growth. Furthermore, cell integrity and inner membrane permeabilization assays were performed to understand the origin of such effect. The results of these assays were statistically analyzed to reveal the bactericidal effect of magnetic field, indicating cell membrane damage. Under the investigated culture conditions, the bactericidal effect was found to be less effective for S. Epidermidis than E. coli.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Species distribution of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from different  clinical specimens.
AB  - Staphylococci are Gram positive, non motile, asporogenous bacteria that characteristically divide in more than one plane to form irregular cluster. Species are classified as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are reported to be the third causative agent of nosocomial infections and the most frequent cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Strains of CoNS those are resistant to methicillin referred to as Methicillin Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (MRCoNS). Now a days, MRCoNS has been increasing as a serious nosocomial pathogen having the property of multi drug resistance. The present study was conducted to see the species distribution, antibiotic resistance patterns and some virulence factors of CoNS isolated from different clinical specimens. This cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College during the period from July 2009 to May 2011. A total of 300 clinical specimens were collected for this study of which 240 were found culture positive as single isolate. Among them 110 were from surgical wound, 80 from pus of skin infections, 30 from burn ulcer exudates and 20 from diabetic ulcer exudates. A total of 80 strains of CoNS were isolated from them. Besides CoNS other isolated bacteria were S. aureus, Pseudomonas spp and Escherichia coli. The CoNS were initially detected by coagulase test. All the strains that were either slide or tube coagulase negative were further identified by different biochemical tests using a commercial kit HiStaph Identification Kit (HiMedia Laboratories Ltd) which comprise a set of 12 standard biochemical tests. A total of 16 species were identified. These were S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. caprae, S. haemolyticus, S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. hyicus, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. auricularis, S. lugdunensis, S. felis, S. capitis, S. chromogenes, S. carnosus and S. gallinarum. Of them S. epidermidis was the most prevalent (17%) followed by S. saprophyticus (15%), S. caprae (11%), S. haemolyticus (9%).
TI  - Study on carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde polymeric films: mechanical properties, release kinetics and antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.
AB  - Polyethylene-co-vinylacetate (EVA) films with different concentrations (3.5 wt% and 7 wt%) of essential oil constituents, carvacrol or cinnamaldehyde, were prepared and characterized by mechanical, antibacterial and antibiofilm properties. The incorporation of the compounds into copolymer films affected their elastic modulus, tensile stress and elongation at break. Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde act as plasticizers which reduce the intermolecular forces of polymer chains, thus improving the flexibility and extensibility of the film. The analysis of the surface characteristics demonstrated that essential oil constituents lowered the contact angle values without causing any remarkable variation of the surface roughness. The films allowed progressive diffusion of the bioactive molecules and the kinetic of release was correlated with the damaging effect on bacterial growth. The kill curves proved that the film with essential oil constituents (7 wt%) had a significant bactericidal effect (reduction of 4 and 2 log CFU) against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes (reduction of about 1 log CFU). With regard to biofilm formation the biomass formed on polymeric films surface was significantly reduced if compared with the pure copolymer control. The results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy images by Live/dead staining. The reduction in the surface tension coupled to an inherent bactericidal property of carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde could in turn affect the initial attachment phase of bacteria and compromise the normal biofilm development.
TI  - Prokaryotic selectivity and LPS-neutralizing activity of short antimicrobial peptides designed from the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.
AB  - To develop novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin AMP, LL-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on IG-19 (residues 13-31 of LL-37) were synthesized. Among the IG-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower LPS-neutralizing activity compared to parental LL-37. The analogs, a5, a6, a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed LPS-neutralizing activity comparable to that of LL-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. These results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of LPS-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. Furthermore, to increase LPS-neutralizing activity of the analog a4 without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized Trp-substituted analogs (a4-W1 and a4-W2), in which Phe(5) or Phe(15) of a4 is replaced by Trp. Despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-W2 displayed much higher LPS-neutralizing activity compared to a4-W1. When compared with parental LL-37, a4-W2 showed retained LPS-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. These results suggest that the effective site for Trp-substitution when designing novel AMPs with higher LPS-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. Taken together, the analog a4-W2 can serve as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.
TI  - Inhibitory and antimicrobial activities of OGTI and HV-BBI peptides, fragments and analogs derived from amphibian skin.
AB  - A series of linear and cyclic fragments and analogs of two peptides (OGTI and HV-BBI) isolated from skin secretions of frogs were synthesized by the solid-phase method. Their inhibitory activity against several serine proteinases: bovine beta-trypsin, bovine alpha-chymotypsin, human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G from human neutrophils, was investigated together with evaluation of their antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive species isolated from patients (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp.). The cytotoxicity of the selected peptides toward an immortal human skin fibroblast cell line was also determined. Three peptides: HV-BBI, its truncated fragment HV-BBI(3-18) and its analog [Phe(8)]HV-BBI can be considered as bifunctional compounds with inhibitory as well as antibacterial properties. OGTI, although it did not display trypsin inhibitory activity as previously reported in the literature, exerted antimicrobial activity toward S. epidermidis. In addition, under our experimental conditions, this peptide did not show cytotoxicity.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract and compounds from Polygonum limbatum.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the  cytotoxicity of the methanol extract (PLA) as well as fractions (PLA1-4) and compounds [cardamomin (1), (+/-)-polygohomoisoflavanone (2), (S)-(-)-pinostrobin (3), 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (4), (2S)-(-)-5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (5), and (2S)-(-)-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone (6)] obtained from leaves of Polygonum limbatum. The microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against 11 microbial strains including Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S.epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The sulphorhodamine B cell growth inhibition assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the above samples on lung A549 adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma MCF-7, prostate carcinoma PC-3, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. The results of the MIC determination indicated that, apart from fraction PLA3, all other fractions as well as PLA and compound 3 were selectively active. MIC values were noted on 100 % of the 11 tested microorganisms for fraction PLA3, 72.7 % for PLA, fraction PLA2, and compound 4, 63.6 % for PLA1, and 54.5 % for fraction PLA4. The results of the cytotoxicity assay revealed that, except for A459 cells, more than 50 % inhibition of the proliferation was obtained with each of the tested samples on at least one of the four other cell lines. IC(5)(0) values below 4 microg/mL were obtained with 1 and 4 on THP-1 cells. The overall results of the present study provided baseline information for the possible use of Polygonum limbatum as well as some of the isolated compounds for the control of cancer diseases and mostly leukemia.
TI  - Antimicrobial lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV: role of the three Aib residues on conformation and bioactivity.
AB  - The lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV is a natural, non-ribosomally synthesized, antimicrobial peptide remarkably resistant to the action of hydrolytic enzymes. This feature may be connected to the multiple presence in its sequence of the non-coded residue alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), which is known to be responsible for the adoption of particularly stable helical structures already at the level of short peptides. To investigate the role of Aib residues on the 3D-structure and bioactivity of trichogin GA IV, we synthesized and fully characterized four analogs where one or two Aib residues are replaced by L-Leu. Our extensive conformational studies (including an X-ray diffraction analysis) and biological assays performed on these analogs showed that the Aib to L-Leu replacements do not affect the resistance to proteolysis, but modulate the bioactivity of trichogin GA IV in a 3D-structure related manner.
TI  - Evaluation of the wound healing potential of Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wedelia trilobata (L.) Hitchc (Asteraceae) leaves are used in the treatment of wounds by traditional healers. Despite the use of this plant in wound healing, there is a scarcity of scientific data to support its therapeutic application. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the wound healing potential of Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves commonly employed by traditional healers and to clarify its traditional use in a scientific investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ethanolic extract of Wedelia trilobata leaves was subjected to column chromatography. Hexane, ethyl acetate (WEA) and chloroform:methanol (50:50) (WCM) fractions were obtained. The fractions were tested using relevant in vitro wound healing assays. Antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH assay. The fibroblast proliferation, oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, an in vitro scratch assay, and increasing collagen content was determined using fibroblast L929. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: WEA (3 mug/mL) promoted fibroblast L929 survivability up to more than 90% before and more than 85% after hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress. WEA (3 mug/mL) induced a 70% migration rate in the in vitro scratch assay and the collagen content was increased to 261 mug/mL compared to the control (57.5 mug/mL). WCM exhibited a scavenging activity for DPPH with an IC(50) value of 179.5 mug/mL comparable to BHT (139.3 mug/mL). WEA was active against gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.25 mug/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION: These scientific findings of wound healing activity supports the traditional claims for Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves. The WEA displayed antibacterial and fibroblast stimulatory activities while WCM exhibited antioxidant to indicate its potential wound healing properties. However further studies to isolate the antibacterial, antioxidant and fibroblast stimulatory compounds that contribute to the wound healing properties of this plant are needed.
TI  - Propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF(R)), an innovative chemically and biologically reproducible pharmaceutical compound for treating wounds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a formulation, containing the propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF((R))), which can assist in the healing of skin lesions. To achieve this objective the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the propolis extract was determined. The final product was subjected to in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical evaluation. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extracts and formulations against the microorganisms most commonly found in burns, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wistar rats with puncture wounded skin were used to evaluate the wound healing properties of propolis. The results of chemical and biological characterization demonstrated the batch-to-batch reproducibility of the standardized extract which is an unprecedented result. The antimicrobial and wound healing activity of the pharmaceutical studied showed the best results when samples contain 3.6% propolis, suggesting that this is the most promising composition.
TI  - Studies on DNA binding behaviour of biologically active transition metal complexes of new tetradentate N2O2 donor Schiff bases: inhibitory activity against bacteria.
AB  - A series of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the type ML have been synthesized with Schiff bases derived from o-acetoacetotoluidide, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine/1,4-diaminobutane. The complexes are insoluble in common organic solvents but soluble in DMF and DMSO. The measured molar conductance values in DMSO indicate that the complexes are non-electrolytic in nature. All the six metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The analytical data helped to elucidate the structure of the metal complexes. The Schiff bases are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around all the metal ions. The binding properties of metal complexes with DNA were investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Detailed analysis reveals that the metal complexes intercalate into the DNA base stack as intercalators. All the metal complexes cleave the pUC19 DNA in presence of H(2)O(2.) The Schiff bases and their complexes have been screened for their antibacterial activity against five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) by disk diffusion method. All the metal complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Transforming the untransformable: application of direct transformation to manipulate genetically Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The strong restriction barrier present in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis has limited functional genomic analysis to a small subset of strains that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Recently, a conserved type IV restriction system termed SauUSI (which specifically recognizes cytosine methylated DNA) was identified as the major barrier to transformation with foreign DNA. Here we have independently corroborated these findings in a widely used laboratory strain of S. aureus. Additionally, we have constructed a DNA cytosine methyltransferase mutant in the high-efficiency Escherichia coli cloning strain DH10B (called DC10B). Plasmids isolated from DC10B can be directly transformed into clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. We also show that the loss of restriction (both type I and IV) in an S. aureus USA300 strain does not have an impact on virulence. Circumventing the SauUSI restriction barrier, combined with an improved deletion and transformation protocol, has allowed the genetic manipulation of previously untransformable strains of these important opportunistic pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Staphylococcal infections place a huge burden on the health care sector due both to their severity and also to the economic impact of treating the infections because of prolonged hospitalization. To improve the understanding of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis infections, we have developed a series of improved techniques that allow the genetic manipulation of strains that were previously refractory to transformation. These developments will speed up the process of mutant construction and increase our understanding of these species as a whole, rather than just a small subset of strains that could previously be manipulated.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activities of two Streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of Universiti Putra Malaysia.
AB  - This study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. The two isolates designated as B8 and C2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of Universiti Putra Malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. Their antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on Mueller Hinton and Tryptic Soy agar. In both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with B8 against all the test bacteria and C2 against five of them (Bacillus sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., S. aureus and S. epidermidis). Re-assessment against E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate B8 against both ATTC strains while C2 only against S. aureus ATCC 25923. Streptomyces griseus ATCC 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both ATCC strains. Subsequently, the two isolates were identified by PCR/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be Streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16S rRNA and rpoB genes). Characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculineC and 28 masculineC), on different microbiological media (AIA, ISP-2, MHA, NA, PDA and TSA), were performed. More morphological features were observed on ISP-2 for both isolates. A higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculineC in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate B8 outnumbered C2 at all experimental conditions. The observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.
TI  - Silver coated bioactive glass particles for wound healing applications.
AB  - Bioactive glass particles (0.42SiO(2)-0.15CaO-0.23Na(2)O-0.20ZnO) of varying size (<90 mum and 425-850 mum) were synthesized and coated with silver (Ag) to produce Ag coated particles (PAg). These were compared against the uncoated analogous particles (Pcon.). Surface area analysis determined that Ag coating of the glass particles resulted in increased the surface area from 2.90 to 9.12 m(2)/g (90 mum) and 1.09-7.71 m(2)/g (425-850 mum). Scanning electron microscopy determined that the Ag coating remained at the surface and there was little diffusion through the bulk. Antibacterial (Escherichia coli--13 mm and Staphylococcus epidermidis--12 mm) and antifungal testing (Candida albicans--7.7 mm) determined that small Ag-coated glass particles exhibited the largest inhibition zones compared to uncoated particles. pH analysis determined an overall higher pH consider in the smaller particles, where after 24 h the large uncoated and Ag coated particles were 8.27 and 8.74 respectively, while the smaller uncoated and Ag coated particles attained pH values of 9.63 and 9.35 respectively.
TI  - Pathogen identification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: the effect of  bacterial and biofluid specimen contamination.
AB  - In this paper, the potential use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the rapid discrimination and identification of bacterial pathogens in realistic clinical specimens is investigated. Specifically, the common problem of sample contamination was studied by creating mixed samples to investigate the effect that the presence of a second contaminant bacterium in the specimen had on the LIBS-based identification of the primary pathogen. Two closely related bacterial specimens, Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 and Enterobacter cloacae strain ATCC 13047, were mixed together in mixing fractions of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1. LIBS spectra from the three mixtures were reliably classified as the correct E. coli strain with 98.5% accuracy when all the mixtures were withheld from the training model and classified against spectra from pure specimens. To simulate a rapid test for the presence of urinary tract infection pathogens, LIBS spectra were obtained from specimens of Staphylococcus epidermidis obtained from distilled water and sterile urine. LIBS spectra from the urine-harvested bacteria were classified as S. epidermidis with 100% accuracy when classified using a model containing only spectra from other Staphylococci species and with 88.5% accuracy when a model containing five genera of bacteria was utilized. Bacterial specimens comprising five different genera and 13 classifiable taxonomic groups of species and strains were compiled in a library that was tested using external validation techniques. The importance of utilizing external validation techniques where the library is tested with data withheld from all previous testing and training of the model was revealed by comparing the results against "leave-one-out" cross-validation results. Last, the effect of using sequential models for the classification of a single unknown spectrum was investigated by comparing the misclassification of two closely related bacteria, E. coli and E. cloacae, when the classification was first performed using the five-genus bacterial library and then with a smaller model consisting only of E. coli and E. cloacae specimens. This result shows the utility of using successively more targeted analyses and models that use preliminary classifications from more general models as input.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial activity and resistance to oxidation of moringa peregrina seed oil.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the oil extracted with n-hexane from the seeds of Moringa peregrina was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The oil proved effective against all of the tested microorganisms. Standard antibiotics (netilmycin, 5-flucytocine, intraconazole and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid) were used for comparison. The resistance to oxidation of the extracted seed oil was also determined.
TI  - Antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin II secreted by the Arctic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudofactin II is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. Pseudofactin II is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. RESULTS: Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of C. albicans by 92-99%. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of C. albicans growth. CONCLUSION: Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms. Pseudofactin II can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.
TI  - Mirasol PRT system inactivation efficacy evaluated in platelet concentrates by bacteria-contamination model.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Bacterial contamination of blood components, primarily platelet concentrates (PCs), has been identified as one of the most frequent infectious complications in transfusion practice. PC units have a high risk for bacterial growth/multiplication due to their storage at ambient temperature (20 +/- 2 degrees C). Consequences of blood contamination could be effectively prevented or reduced by pathogen inactivation systems. The aim of this study was to determine the Mirasol pathogen reduction technology (PRT) system efficacy in PCs using an artificial bacteria-contamination model. METHODS: According to the ABO blood groups, PC units (n = 216) were pooled into 54 pools (PC-Ps). PC-Ps were divided into three equal groups, with 18 units in each, designed for an artificial bacteria-contamination. Briefly, PC-Ps were contaminated by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli in concentrations 10(2) to 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) per unit. Afterward, PC-Ps were underwent to inactivation by Mirasol PRT system, using UV (lambda = 265-370 nm) activated riboflavin (RB). All PC-Ps were assayed by BacT/Alert Microbial Detection System for CFU quantification before and after the Mirasol treatment. Samples from non-inactivated PC-P units were tested after preparation and immediately following bacterial contamination. Samples from Mirasol treated units were quantified for CFUs one hour, 3 days and 5 days after inactivation. Results. A complete inactivation of all bacteria species was obtained at CFU concentrations of 10(2) and 10(3) per PC-P unit through storage/investigation period. The most effective inactivation (10(5) CFU per PC-P unit) was obtained in Escherichia coli setting. Contrary, inactivation of all the three tested bacteria species was unworkable in concentrations of > or = 10(6) CFU per PC-P unit. CONCLUSION: Efficient inactivation of investigated bacteria types with a significant CFU depletion in PC-P units was obtained--3 Log for all three tested species, and 5 Log for Escherichia coli. The safety of blood component therapy, primarily the clinical use of PCs can be improved using the Mirasol PRT system.
TI  - Examination of bacterial resistance to exogenous nitric oxide.
AB  - While much research has been directed to harnessing the antimicrobial properties  of exogenous NO, the possibility of bacteria developing resistance to such therapy has not been thoroughly studied. Herein, we evaluate potential NO resistance using spontaneous and serial passage mutagenesis assays. Specifically, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were systematically exposed to NO-releasing 75mol% MPTMS-TEOS nitrosothiol particles at or below minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels. In the spontaneous mutagenesis assay, bacteria that survived exposure to lethal concentrations of NO showed no increase in MIC. Similarly, no increase in MIC was observed in the serial passage mutagenesis assay after exposure of these species to sub-inhibitory concentrations of NO through 20 d.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot  ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Due to the extensive use of antibiotics, the spread of drug-resistant bacteria is one of the most worrisome threats to public health. One strategy that can be used to overcome potential shortcomings might be the inactivation of these organisms by photodynamic therapy. In this study, we have investigated whether drug-resistant wound-associated organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) are sensitive to lethal photosensitization using the dye methylene blue coupled with laser light of 660 nm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of photosensitizer concentration (25, 50, 100 microg/ml) and laser light dose (27.3, 54.6 and 109.2 J/cm(2)) on lethal photosensitization was investigated. RESULTS: All species were susceptible to killing by photodynamic inactivation. The bactericidal effect was not dependent on the concentration of methylene blue but it was dependent on the light dose. Methylene blue photosensitization using red laser light (109.2 J/cm(2)) was able to achieve reductions of 99.03% and 98.95% in the viable counts of S. aureus and S. epidermidis (using starting concentrations of 10(4)-10(5) CFU/ml). Eradication of 92.23% were obtained for E. coli (initial concentration 10(4)-10(5) CFU/ml) photosensitized by the red light (109.2 J/cm(2)). CONCLUSION: These findings imply that MB in combination with red light may be an effective means of eradicating drug- resistant bacteria from wounds.
TI  - Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  - CONTEXT: Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. AIMS: This study was conducted to determine the incidence of central venous catheter-related infections (CRIs) and to identify the factors influencing it. So far, there are very few studies that have been conducted on CRBSI in the intensive care unit in India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study carried out in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) over a period of 1 year from January to December 2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 54 patients with indwelling central venous catheters of age group between 20 and 75 years were included. The catheters were cultured using the standard semiquantitative culture (SQC) method. Statistical analysis used SPSS-10 version statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 54 CVC catheters with 319 catheter days were included in this study. Of 54 patients with CVCs studied for bacteriology, 39 (72.22%) catheters showed negative SQCs and also negative blood cultures. A total of 15 (27.77%) catheters were positive on SQC, of which 10 (18.52%) were with catheter-associated infection and four (7.41%) were with catheter-associated bacteremia; the remaining one was a probable catheter-associated bacteremia. CRIs were high among catheters that were kept in situ for more than 3 days and emergency procedures where two or more attempts were required for catheterization (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis of covariance duration of catheter in situ for >3 days, inexperienced venupucturist, more number of attempts and emergency CVC were associated with more incidence of CVCBSIs, with P <0.02. The duration of catheter in situ was negatively correlated (-0.53) and number of attempts required to put CVC was positively correlated (+0.39) with incidence of CVCBSIs. Sixty-five percent of the isolates belonged to the CONS group (13/20). Staphylococcus epidermidis showed maximum susceptibility to amikacin, doxycycline and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid and was susceptible to vancomycin (100%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% susceptible to amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli was susceptible to amikacin and cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of CRI was 27.77% (15/54). Catheter-associated BSIs were 47.31 per 1000 catheter-days. CRI was low in the catheters inserted by the experienced venipuncturists, elective procedure and CVC kept in situ for </=3 days. S. epidermidis was the most common isolate.
TI  - Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of acellular vascular grafts.
AB  - Several studies have reported biological vascular grafts to be more resistant to  microbial infection than synthetic counterparts in vivo. Indeed, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) materials have previously been reported to be antimicrobial. The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity and the ability to resist biofilm formation of a novel acellular vascular graft and compare it to commercially available alternatives using a range of organisms: MRSA, MSSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. This was achieved using a modified disk diffusion assay and extraction of the materials into solution followed by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. To assess resistance to biofilm formation a novel biofilm assay was developed which compared the total colony forming units (CFU) recovered from each material and identification of the percentage of CFU which were loosely attached, residing within the biofilm or attached to the biomaterial. The results indicated a lack of antimicrobial activity for all materials tested, including SIS. The biological materials were more resistant to the formation of a biofilm compared to Dacron.
TI  - Effects of cranberry extracts on growth and biofilm production of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus species.
AB  - Biofilm producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus species and Escherichia coli are the most common cause of catheter related urinary tract infections (UTIs). The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is utilized widely as a prophylaxis for UTIs due to its prevention of microbial adhesion. Cranberry contains proanthocyanidins (PACs), which have been implicated as active constituents responsible for its bacterial antiadhesive properties. Despite overwhelming data supporting cranberry's beneficial effects against human pathogenic bacteria, there is limited information regarding its effects on biofilm formation. This study evaluated the effects of three proprietary PAC-standardized cranberry extracts on the inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production against a panel of clinically relevant pathogens: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Escherichia coli. The extracts inhibited the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus spp.) but not the Gram-negative species (E. coli) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range 0.02-5 mg/mL. The extracts also inhibited biofilm production by the Gram-positive bacteria but did not eradicate their established biofilm. These results suggest that cranberry may have beneficial effects against the growth and biofilm producing capability of Gram-positive bacteria pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of silver-reinforced carbon nanotube and hydroxyapatite composites.
AB  - Bacterial infection remains an important risk factor after orthopedic surgery. The present paper reports the synthesis of hydroxyapatite-silver (HA-Ag) and carbon nanotube-silver (CNT-Ag) composites via spark plasma sintering (SPS) route. The retention of the initial phases after SPS was confirmed by phase analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Energy dispersive spectrum analysis showed that Ag was distributed uniformly in the CNT/HA matrix. The breakage of CNTs into spheroid particles at higher temperatures (1700) is attributed to the Rayleigh instability criterion. Mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) of the samples were evaluated using nanoindentation testing. Ag reinforcement resulted in the enhancement of hardness (by ~15%) and elastic modulus (~5%) of HA samples, whereas Ag reinforcement in CNT, Ag addition does not have much effect on hardness (0.3 GPa) and elastic modulus (5 GPa). The antibacterial tests performed using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant decrease (by ~65-86%) in the number of adhered bacteria in HA/CNT composites reinforced with 5% Ag nanoparticles. Thus, Ag-reinforced HA/CNT can serve as potential antibacterial biocomposites.
TI  - Taurolidine lock solution in the secondary prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection in home parenteral nutrition patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CBSI) is a serious complication in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). The aim was to analyze the impact of taurolidine-citrate lock solution (TLS) on CBSI rate in HPN patients with a high risk of catheter infection. METHODS: This retrospective study compared CBSI rates 12 months before and 12 months after implementation of TLS. In the first period, only standardized strategies were used to reduce the CBSI rate. In the second period, TLS was injected into the catheter at the end of parenteral nutrition. The CBSI rate with a confident interval was calculated as Poisson event rates, and compared by testing for homogeneity of rates. RESULTS: 15 patients were included. During the 24 months, the CBSI rate was 6.58/1000 catheter-days in the first period and 1.09/1000 catheter-days in the second period (p < 0.001). In patients with TLS once a week (n = 8), the CBSI rate decreased from 4.8/1000 catheter-days to 1.37/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.02) and in patients with TLS after each TPN (n = 7), the CBSI rate decreased from 8.61/1000 catheter-days to 0.78/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In HPN patients, TLS associated with standardized precautions significantly reduced the CBSI rate.
TI  - Bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance in catheter urine specimens following radical prostatectomy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are increasing reports of infectious complications following prostate biopsy due to fluoroquinolone resistance. To determine infectious complications at catheter removal following radical prostatectomy (RP), another setting in daily urological practice where fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is frequently used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined urine culture results collected from 334 RP patients immediately prior to catheter removal. Patients received prophylactic antibiotics 1 day before, the day of, and for 5 days after catheter removal. Culture results were reviewed for bacterial species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Patients with positive urine cultures resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic were switched to culture-specific antibiotic therapy and underwent follow-up culture. The frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI), complications, additional antibiotic therapy, and repeat urine cultures was determined within 60 days. RESULTS: Of the 334 patients identified, 203 (61%) had cultures with no bacterial growth, and 48 (14%) had colony counts of <1,000 bacteria or Candida albicans and received no further antibiotics. The remaining 83 (25%) had positive culture results, of which 7% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Twenty-four bacterial species were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%) Escherichia coli (4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3%) being the most frequent. Only two (0.6%) men developed clinical symptoms consistent with UTI (i.e., suprapubic pain, fever) prior to catheter removal, and no serious complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of RP patients have positive urine cultures at the time of catheter removal, despite the administration of prophylactic fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Potentially virulent organisms are commonly cultured, and ciprofloxacin resistance is frequent. However, outcomes are favorable when culture-specific oral antibiotic therapy is initiated.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - Indole-3-acetaldehyde from Rhodococcus sp. BFI 332 inhibits Escherichia coli O157:H7 biofilm formation.
AB  - Pathogenic biofilms have been associated with persistent infections due to their  high resistance to antimicrobial agents. To identify nontoxic biofilm inhibitors for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, the spent media of a 4,104 Actinomycetes library was screened. The culture spent medium (1%, v/v) of plant pathogen Rhodococcus sp. BFI 332 markedly inhibited E. coli O157:H7 biofilm formation without affecting the growth of planktonic E. coli O157:H7 cells. Rhodococcus sp. BFI 332 produced significant amounts of indole-3-acetaldehyde and indole-3-acetic acid, and the former of which reduced E. coli O157:H7 biofilm formation. Global transcriptome analyses showed that indole-3-acetaldehyde most repressed two curli operons, csgBAC and csgDEFG, and induced tryptophanase (tnaAB) in E. coli O157:H7 biofilm cells. Electron microscopy showed that spent medium of Rhodococcus sp. BFI 332 and indole-3-acetaldehyde reduced curli production in E. coli O157:H7. The spent medium of Rhodococcus sp. BFI 332 also significantly reduced the biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Overall, this study suggests that indole derivatives are present in the Actinomycetes strains and they can be used as biofilm inhibitors against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Prosthetic vascular graft infections between blood and concordance of graft culture pathogen.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prosthetic vascular graft infection (PVGI) is an infrequent and potentially fatal complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery and occlusive vascular disease. The predictive value of blood cultures in accurately identifying the causative pathogen (or pathogens) has not been determined. METHODS: We studied the compatibility between results of blood and graft cultures obtained from patients suffering from late-onset (>4 months after surgery) infections of abdominal prosthetic vascular grafts. RESULTS: Among 17 patients who suffered from late-onset abdominal PVGI, only in 3 patients (17.6%), the same microorganisms isolated from blood cultures were also identified by direct cultures from excised grafts or perigraft tissues. Three patients (17.6%) had negative blood cultures and the rest (n = 11; 64.7%) had different growth of microorganisms from the blood and graft cultures. Three patients were diagnosed with chronic Q fever vascular graft infection, all of whom had positive blood cultures. On the basis of graft cultures, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were responsible for nearly 50% of cases. CONCLUSION: The yield of blood cultures in late-onset abdominal PVGIs is low. Presence of microorganisms in blood cultures does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship with graft infection. An empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is advised in all suspected cases until a definitive etiology has been made.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol isolated from Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.: a  traditional medicinal plant.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The leaves of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used in folk medicine in India to treat various ailments like cough, malaria, indigestion, influenza lung diseases and rheumatism, fever, stomach ailments, cholera and diarrhea. In our earlier communication we have reported the antimicrobial study on the various extracts of the leaves and the isolation and identification of Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid as the major active principle. In the present study, we report the antibacterial and antifungal activities of Ulopterol, a coumarin isolated as another major active antimicrobial principle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves were successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water. The extracts were studied for their antimicrobial activity against selected bacteria and fungi by using disc-diffusion method. The ethyl acetate extract which was found to possess highest antimicrobial activity was subjected to activity guided fractionation by column chromatography over silica gel. This resulted in the isolation of the coumarin, Ulopetrol, an active principle besides Flindersine which was reported by us earlier. The structure of the compound was elucidated using physical and spectroscopic data. Flindersine and Ulopterol were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS: Ulopterol showed activity against the bacteria viz. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-3967), Escherichia coli (ESBL-3984) and fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus, Candida krusei and Botrytis cinerea. Quantification by HPLC showed the content of Flindersine and Ulopterol to be 0.361% and 0.266% respectively on dry weight basis of the leaves. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract (successive extraction) contained Ulopterol, a coumarin, besides Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid, as a major active principle in the antimicrobial studies. This is the first report of the antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol and also its first report from the plant.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - Prevention of vascular graft infections with antibiotic graft impregnation prior  to implantation: in vitro comparison between daptomycin, rifampin and nebacetin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the in vitro efficacy of graft impregnation with nebacetin  versus rifampin versus daptomycin against vascular graft infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus and nebacetin versus rifampin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. MATERIALS: Twenty-three Dacron-grafts (1 cm2) for each micro-organism were microbiologically tested and eight grafts per antibiotic underwent viability tests against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Fifteen grafts (5/antibiotic agent) underwent 15 min impregnation and contamination with 4 ml bacterial solution (optical density (OD (600 nm)): 0.20 +/- 0.02). After 24-h-incubation, all grafts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and underwent sonification to release viable adherent bacteria. OD (600 nm) of the solution was measured. Afterwards, six 1:10 dilution steps took place and colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. RESULTS: Nebacetin showed comparable efficacy to daptomycin against Gram-positive bacteria. Both eradicated more efficiently S. epidermidis than rifampin (daptomycin:0, rifampin:5 +/- 7.3, nebacetin:0 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.0003). All antibiotics showed comparable antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Nebacetin was more efficient than rifampin to eradicate Gram-negative organisms (P. aeruginosa: rifampin:1308 +/- 252, nebacetin:8 +/- 8 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.01, E. coli: rifampin:294 +/- 159, nebacetin:0.2 +/- 0.5 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.001), while only rifampin was toxic against ECs (daptomycin:30.88 +/- 5.44, rifampin:5.13 +/- 5.08, nebacetin:28.50 +/- 3.82 ECs/field, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Nebacetin showed excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens representing an effective candidate for vascular graft impregnation.
TI  - Locking tunneled hemodialysis catheters with hypertonic saline (26% NaCl) and heparin to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections and thrombosis: a randomized, prospective trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tunneled cuffed dual-lumen catheters (TCCs) are commonly used for vascular access in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is the major problem leading to morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether 26% NaCl solution has any favorable effect on the infections and thrombosis caused by HD catheters. METHODS: TCCs were locked with either 26% NaCl and heparin or standard heparin. The primer end point of the study was the CRBSI or thrombosis of the TCC. We compared the antimicrobial activity of the NaCl solutions (6.5%, 13%, 26%) with 0.9% NaCl solution by time-kill kinetic assay. All tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. RESULTS: The mean catheter survival was significantly higher in the 26% NaCl and heparin group (129.5 +/- 50.1 catheter days to 103.3 +/- 59.8, p = 0.008). CRBSI rates (10-15.4%) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.54). The hypertonic 13% NaCl solution had bactericidal effects on E. coli and P. aeruginosa, but had bacteriostatic effect on S. aureus and S. epidermidis. CONCLUSION: In this study we demonstrated that the 13% NaCl solution and more hypertonic NaCl solutions revealed potent in vitro antimicrobial properties against all checked Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Essential oil of Myrica esculenta Buch. Ham.: composition, antimicrobial and topical anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Hydrodistilled oil obtained from the stem bark of Myrica esculenta Buch. Ham. ex  D. Don (yield 0.3%) was analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS. The volatile oil consisted mainly of n-hexadecanol (25.2%), eudesmol acetate (21.9%), palmitic acid (11.6%), cis-beta-caryophyllene (8.7%), n-pentadecanol (7.7%) and n-octadecanol (7.6%). The oil was found to be a potential antimicrobial agent against Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The essential oil exhibited significant topical anti-inflammatory activity compared to standard drug in Swiss albino mice ear.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.
TI  - Inactivation of microorganisms within collagen gel biomatrices using pulsed electric field treatment.
AB  - Pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment was examined as a potential decontamination method for tissue engineering biomatrices by determining the susceptibility of a range of microorganisms whilst within a collagen gel. High intensity pulsed electric fields were applied to collagen gel biomatrices containing either Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the spores of Aspergillus niger. The results established varying degrees of microbial PEF susceptibility. When high initial cell densities (10(6)-10(7) CFU ml(-1)) were PEF treated with 100 pulses at 45 kV cm(-1), the greatest log reduction was achieved with S. cerevisiae (~6.5 log(10) CFU ml(-1)) and the lowest reduction achieved with S. epidermidis (~0.5 log(10) CFU ml(-1)). The results demonstrate that inactivation is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the microorganism treated. Further investigations are required to optimise the microbial inactivation kinetics associated with PEF treatment of collagen gel biomatrices.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some Indian Ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. Herbal preparations such as Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna, Manjistadi churna, Sukhsarak churna, Ajmodadi churna, Shivkshar pachan churna, Mahasudarshan churna, Swadist Virechan churna and Pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris, respectively. In the present study, Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhi. The study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from Hypericum spp.
AB  - Biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. New drugs are needed to combat these pathogens. Hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. However, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. The investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species Hypericum densiflorum, Hypericum ellipticum, Hypericum prolificum, and Hypericum punctatum as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. Assays were conducted against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.95 microg/mL to 7.81 microg/mL. Four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain Gram-positive strains at sub-MIC concentrations.
TI  - Recombinant human DNase I decreases biofilm and increases antimicrobial susceptibility in staphylococci.
AB  - Extracellular DNA is an adhesive component of staphylococcal biofilms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using a 96-well microtiter plate crystal-violet binding assay, we found that biofilm formation by S. aureus was efficiently inhibited by rhDNase at 1-4 mug l(-)(1), and preformed S. aureus biofilms were efficiently detached in 2 min by rhDNase at 1 mg l(-)(1). Pretreatment of S. aureus biofilms for 10 min with 10 mg l(-)(1) rhDNase increased their sensitivity to biocide killing by 4-5 log units. rhDNase at 10 mg l(-)(1) significantly inhibited biofilm formation by S. epidermidis in medium supplemented with sub-MICs of antibiotics. We also found that rhDNase significantly increased the survival of S. aureus-infected Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes treated with tobramycin compared with nematodes treated with tobramycin alone. We concluded that rhDNase exhibits potent antibiofilm and antimicrobial-sensitizing activities against S. aureus and S. epidermidis at clinically achievable concentrations. rhDNase, either alone or in combination with antimicrobial agents, may have applications in treating or preventing staphylococcal biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Culture-based detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by a network of European laboratories: an external quality assessment study.
AB  - Twenty-three hospital laboratories from Europe and Israel participated in an external quality assessment (EQA) of the culture-based detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Participants also reported the MRSA prevalence in clinical cultures and patient screening specimens, as well as the MRSA screening practices employed at their hospitals. An EQA panel of 18 samples consisting of two MRSA harbouring SCCmec IV and I, and one strain each of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative S. epidermidis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and Escherichia coli as pure strains or in mixtures at 10(7)-1 cfu absolute loads was analysed by the 23 participants. Seventeen (74%) participants identified 17 or more samples correctly. Of these, 15 (88%) utilised a chromogenic medium alone (ChromID, bioMerieux; BBL CHROMagar, BD Diagnostics; MRSA Select, Bio-Rad Laboratories) or combined with a conventional medium and up to three confirmatory tests. Proportions of MRSA among S. aureus isolated from clinical cultures varied widely, even among hospitals within countries, ranging from 11-20% to 61-70%. MRSA carriage rates were less variable (0-20%) between countries. Almost all participants (n=22, 96%) screened patients for MRSA carriage during 2009-2010, of which 15 (68%) screened intensive care unit (ICU) patients alone or combined with other targeted high-risk groups, and 10 (45%) combined nasal screening with another body site.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  - Nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and activity of these molecules was outlined. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or N(6)-positions and bearing N-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. The data obtained, MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the N(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive group with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). The intact sugar moiety seemed to be not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in N(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, N-1 proved to be non-crucial and the 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an MIC of 32 mg l(-1) against Staph. aureus and Strep. pneumoniae. None of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. Hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the N(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Identification, characterization, and recombinant expression of epidermicin NI01, a novel unmodified bacteriocin produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis that displays potent activity against Staphylococci.
AB  - We describe the discovery, purification, characterization, and expression of an antimicrobial peptide, epidermicin NI01, which is an unmodified bacteriocin produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 224. It is a highly cationic, hydrophobic, plasmid-encoded peptide that exhibits potent antimicrobial activity toward a wide range of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), enterococci, and biofilm-forming S. epidermidis strains. Purification of the peptide was achieved using a combination of hydrophobic interaction, cation exchange, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis yielded a molecular mass of 6,074 Da, and partial sequence data of the peptide were elucidated using a combination of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and de novo sequencing. The draft genome sequence of the producing strain was obtained using 454 pyrosequencing technology, thus enabling the identification of the structural gene using the de novo peptide sequence data previously obtained. Epidermicin NI01 contains 51 residues with four tryptophan and nine lysine residues, and the sequence showed approximately 50% identity to peptides lacticin Z, lacticin Q, and aureocin A53, all of which belong to a new family of unmodified type II-like bacteriocins. The peptide is active in the nanomolar range against S. epidermidis, MRSA isolates, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Other unique features displayed by epidermicin include a high degree of protease stability and the ability to retain antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 2 to 10, and exposure to the peptide does not result in development of resistance in susceptible isolates. In this study we also show the structural gene alone can be cloned into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and expression yields active peptide.
TI  - Inter-laboratory comparison of different rapid methods for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates still represents a major risk in transfusion medicine, and a variety of screening methods have been available to improve the safety of PCs. In the present study, the analytical quality of three different rapid screening methods (BactiFlow flow cytometry, Pan Genera Detection Assay, 23S rRNA RT-PCR) was evaluated in an inter-laboratory comparison in three different German blood services. METHODS: Samples were inoculated with different bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli (two strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (one strain), Serratia marcescens (one strain)] at different counts (4.5 x 10(3) -4.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml) alternating with negative samples in one transfusion facility. Samples were blinded with a random order for each screening method, shipped to partners and analysed immediately after receipt with different rapid screening methods. RESULTS: The inter-laboratory comparison revealed that the BactiFlow assay and 23S rRNA RT-PCR-screening detected all samples correctly (positive: 12/12, negative: 8/8). The Pan Genera Detection Assay test detected only four of the positive samples. Four of the non-detected positive samples were below the assay's detection limit. Another four inoculated samples with comparatively high bacteria counts were detected false negative (E. coli (two strains): 9.87 x 10(5) and 2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively, K. pneumoniae: 4.79 x 10(6) CFU/ml, S. aureus: 6.03 x 10(5) CFU/ml). All rapid screening methods revealed no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Both BactiFlow and 23S rRNA RT-PCR demonstrated a high sensitivity to detecting bacterial contamination in PCs. The Pan Genera Detection Assay had some shortcomings regarding sensitivity, especially for the detection of Gram-negative strains.
TI  - A new depsidone and antibacterial activities of compounds from Usnea undulata Stirton.
AB  - Usnea undulata Stirton (Usneaaceae) is a fruticose lichen used locally in ethnoveterinary medicine to treat mammary infections in cattle while human beings use it for the treatment of wounds in Eastern Cape, South Africa. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of its extracts led to the isolation and characterization of a new depsidone, 2'-O-methylhypostictic acid (8), together with seven known compounds, i.e. methyl beta-orsellinate, norstictic acid, menegazziaic acid, (+) usnic acid, hypoconstictic acid, salazinic acid, and galbinic acid. The structures of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of their spectral analysis including homo- and hetero-nuclear correlation NMR experiments (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) and mass spectra as well as by comparison with available data in the literature. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) values of the compounds against six bacteria were determined. Compound 8 showed inhibitory activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with MICs of 31, 62.5, 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. (+) Usnic acid was most active against B. subtilis, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli with MICs of 8, 8, 31, and 31 mug/ml, respectively, while other compounds exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin exerts antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin-7-like cytokine expressed by epithelial cells and reported to be involved in allergic diseases and atopic eczema. The presence of several predicted alpha-helical regions in TSPL, a structure characterizing many classical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), prompted us to investigate whether TSLP exerts antimicrobial activities. Recombinant human TSLP exerted antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Using synthetic overlapping peptide 20-mers of TSLP, it was demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect is primarily mediated by the C-terminal region of the protein. MKK34 (MKKRRKRKVTTNKCLEQVSQLQGLWRRFNRPLLK), a peptide spanning a C-terminal alpha-helical region in TSLP, showed potent antimicrobial activities, in physiological salt conditions and in the presence of human plasma. Fluorescent studies of peptide-treated bacteria, electron microscopy and liposome leakage models showed that MKK34 exerted membrane-disrupting effects comparable to those of the classical AMP LL-37. Moreover, TSLP was degraded into multiple fragments by staphylococcal V8 proteinase. One major antimicrobial degradation fragment was found to encompass the C-terminal antimicrobial region defined by the MKK34 peptide. We here describe a novel antimicrobial role for TSLP. The antimicrobial activity is primarily mediated by the C-terminal part of the protein. In combination with the previously known cytokine function of TSLP, our result indicates dual functions of the molecule and a previously unknown role in host defense.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Mussel-inspired anchoring for patterning cells using polydopamine.
AB  - This Article introduces a simple method of cell patterning, inspired by the mussel anchoring protein. Polydopamine (PDA), artificial polymers made from self-polymerization of dopamine (a molecule that resembles mussel-adhesive proteins), has recently been studied for its ability to make modifications on surfaces in aqueous solutions. We explored the interfacial interaction between PDA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) using microcontact printing (muCP). We patterned PDA on several substrates such as glass, polystyrene, and poly(dimethylsiloxane) and realized spatially defined anchoring of mammalian cells as well as bacteria. We applied our system in investigating the relationship between areas of mammalian nuclei and that of the cells. The combination of PDA and PEG enables us to make cell patterns on common laboratorial materials in a mild and convenient fashion.
TI  - Effects of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil and the major monoterpene component terpinen-4-ol on the development of single- and multistep antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - This study examined the effect of subinhibitory Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil on the development of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Frequencies of single-step antibiotic-resistant mutants were determined by inoculating bacteria cultured with or without subinhibitory tea tree oil onto agar containing 2 to 8 times the MIC of each antibiotic and with or without tea tree oil. Whereas most differences in resistance frequencies were relatively minor, the combination of kanamycin and tea tree oil yielded approximately 10-fold fewer resistant E. coli mutants than kanamycin alone. The development of multistep antibiotic resistance in the presence of tea tree oil or terpinen-4-ol was examined by culturing S. aureus and E. coli isolates daily with antibiotic alone, antibiotic with tea tree oil, and antibiotic with terpinen-4-ol for 6 days. Median MICs for each antibiotic alone increased 4- to 16-fold by day 6. Subinhibitory tea tree oil or terpinen-4-ol did not greatly alter results, with day 6 median MICs being either the same as or one concentration different from those for antibiotic alone. For tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol alone, day 6 median MICs had increased 4-fold for S. aureus (n = 18) and 2-fold for E. coli (n = 18) from baseline values. Lastly, few significant changes in antimicrobial susceptibility were seen for S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates that had been serially subcultured 14 to 22 times with subinhibitory terpinen-4-ol. Overall, these data indicate that tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol have little impact on the development of antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility.
TI  - Exploring the DNA binding mode of transition metal based biologically active compounds.
AB  - Few novel 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes were synthesized and characterized. Their structural features and other properties were deduced from the elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility and molar conductivity as well as from mass, IR, UV-vis, (1)H NMR and EPR spectral studies. The binding of the complexes with CT-DNA was analyzed by electronic absorption spectroscopy, viscosity measurement, and cyclic voltammetry. The interaction of the metal complexes with DNA was also studied by molecular modeling with special reference to docking. The experimental and docking results revealed that the complexes have the ability of interaction with DNA of minor groove binding mode. The intrinsic binding constants (K(b)) of the complexes with CT-DNA were found out which show that they are minor groove binders. Gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complexes to cleave the pUC19 DNA in the presence of AH(2) (ascorbic acid). Moreover, the oxidative cleavage studies using distamycin revealed the minor groove binding for the newly synthesized 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes. Evaluation of antibacterial activity of the complexes against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited that the complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Anthemis  altissima L. var. altissima.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the flowering parts of Anthemis altissima L. var. altissima was analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. In this study, 34 compounds representing 98.76% of the essential oil were identified. The main components were alpha-terpineol (26.42%), beta-pinene (9.23%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (6.30%), globulol (5.36%), n-tricosane (4.41%), terpinen-4-ol (4.08%) and 1,8 cineole (3.84%). Antibacterial activities of the essential oil and its two major components (alpha-terpineol and beta-pinene) were determined using microdilution method against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. The essential oil showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (MICs ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 microL mL(-1)). It was found that alpha-terpineol with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the range 0.87-1.56 microL mL(-1) was a more potent antibacterial agent than beta-pinene with MIC values of the range 1.56-6.25 microL mL(-1). All of them, the essential oil, beta-pinene and alpha-terpineol, were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative ones.
TI  - Rapid detection of food- and waterborne bacteria using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with silver nanosubstrates.
AB  - Development of rapid and sensitive methods to detect pathogens is important to food and water safety. This study aimed to detect and discriminate important food- and waterborne bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecelis) by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with intracellular nanosilver as SERS substrates. An in vivo molecular probing using intracellular nanosilver for the preparation of bacterial samples was established and assessed. Satisfactory SERS performance and characteristic SERS spectra were obtained from different bacterial samples. Distinctive differences were observed in SERS spectral data, specifically in the Raman shift region of 500-1,800 cm(-1), and between bacterial samples at the species and strain levels. The detection limit of SERS coupled with in vivo molecular probing using silver nanosubstrates could reach the level of single cells. Experiments with a mixture of E. coli O157:H7 and S. epidermidis for SERS measurement demonstrate that SERS could be used for classification of mixed bacterial samples. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize changes of morphology and cellular composition of bacterial cells after treatment of intracellular nanosilver. The results indicate that SERS coupled with intracellular silver nanosubstrates is a promising method for detection and characterization of food- and waterborne pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial samples.
TI  - Cloning, expression and purification of extracellular serine protease Esp, a biofilm-degrading enzyme, from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - AIMS: Staphylococcus epidermidis Esp, an extracellular serine protease, inhibits  Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and nasal colonization. To further expand the biotechnological applications of Esp, we developed a highly efficient and economic method for the purification of recombinant Esp based on a Brevibacillus choshinensis expression-secretion system. METHODS AND RESULTS: The esp gene was fused with the N-terminal Sec-dependent signal sequence of the B. choshinensis cell wall protein and a C-terminal hexa-histidine-tag gene. The recombinant Esp was expressed and secreted into the optimized medium as an immature form and subsequently activated by thermolysin. The mature Esp was easily purified by a single purification step using nickel affinity chromatography and showed proteolytic activity as well as Staph. aureus biofilm destruction activity. CONCLUSIONS: The purification yield of the developed extracellular production system was 5 mg recombinant mature Esp per 20-ml culture, which was much higher than that of an intracellular production system in Escherichia coli (3 mg recombinant Esp per 1-l culture). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our findings will be a powerful tool for the production and purification of recombinant Esp and also applicable to a large variety of recombinant proteins used for basic researches and biotechnological applications.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) for long-term antifouling ability.
AB  - Development of biomaterials with long-term biocompatibility, durability, and stability remains a critical challenge for biomedical devices. Here, we synthesize, characterize, and graft poly(N-(2-hydroxyethyl)acrylamide) (polyHEAA) onto both gold surfaces and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) to form a stable antifouling coating to resist nonspecific protein adsorption and bacterial attachment. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results demonstrate that all of polyHEAA brushes coated on the gold substrate at a wide range of film thickness of ~10-40 nm can achieve almost zero protein adsorption from undiluted blood plasma and serum for 1 h, while static bacteria assay results show that polyHEAA brushes prohibit long-term bacterial colonization by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli RP437 up to 3 days. Moreover, the polyHEAA-coated AuNPs with different diameters remain their hydrodynamic sizes unchanged in human blood plasma and serum for up to 7 days. All these data indicate that polyHEAA can serve as promising biomaterials with long-term biocompatibility and durability suitable for applications in complex biological media.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli in milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-tube mPCR assay was developed. The accuracy of the mPCR was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of E. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). The threshold of detection of the mPCR assay was 10 fg of genomic DNA and <10(3) CFU ml(-1). A comparative evaluation of mPCR with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mPCR to be more efficacious. Subsequently, the mPCR showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. CONCLUSION: The developed mPCR assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. The assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. The early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  - There is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. However, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. Infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) were reviewed regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. Growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees C. The activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the MBEC Assay. Infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at SJCRH. Heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. Ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. Heparin lock solutions containing the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. These findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - The persistent microbicidal effect in water exposed to the corona discharge.
AB  - This article describes and particularly explains a new phenomenon of persistent microbicidal effect of water previously exposed to the low-temperature plasma, which cannot be attributed to the acidification only. The direct microbicidal action of plasma is well documented, being mediated by number of reactive particles with a short lifetime. However, we observed the microbicidal effect also in exposed water stored for a month, where it must be mediated by stable particles. In water and in phosphate-buffered saline, the formation of NO(x) and corresponding acids, H(2)O(2) and O(3) was confirmed after exposition to the low-temperature plasma generated in air by DC negative glow corona and positive streamer discharge. The time course of acidification, H(2)O(2) and O(3) formation were deremined. Except uncertain traces of HCN, SIFT-MS analysis of exposed liquids reveals no additional reactive compounds. The microbicidal effect persists almost unchanged during 4 weeks of storage, although O(3) completely and H(2)O(2) almost disappears. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were inactivated within 10 min of incubation in exposed liquids, Candida albicans needs at least 1 h. The solutions prepared by artificial mixing of reactive compounds mimic the action of exposed water, but in lesser extent. The acid milieu is the main cause of the microbicidal effect, but the possibility of still unidentified additional compound remains open.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Optimization of a two-step permeabilization fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspects of the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for the detection of clinically important bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were investigated for optimization. METHODS: Various approaches to optimizing the FISH procedure were taken and different methods were compared. To save time, hybridization and washing buffers were prepared beforehand and stored at -20 degrees C and mixed to their final formamide and NaCl concentrations just before use. The use of 50-ml tubes for hybridization incubation reduced drying out, reagent wastage, and reaction times. RESULTS: A two-step permeabilization FISH assay was developed that used phosphate-buffered saline as a buffer for lysostaphin. It could detect bacteria with DNA probes conjugated to fluorophores with a higher signal intensity and the less expensive biotinylated DNA probes with minimal cell lysis in 1 hr. CONCLUSIONS: The two-step assay might be used when the FISH signal is weak, bacterial numbers are low or if there is a need to use other reporter molecules.
TI  - Intravenous device associated blood stream staphylococcal infection in paediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Intravenous device (IVD) associated nosocomial blood stream infections due to staphylococci are major cause of morbidity and mortality. The present study was carried out to assess the frequency of staphylococcal IVD associated infections in a paediatric ward of a tertiary case hospital. Prevalence of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials in hospital acquired staphylococcal isolates was also tested. METHODS: Children admitted in paediatric wards with IVD for more than 48 h were enrolled. Blood, IVD tip at the time of removal, skin swab at the site of insertion of IVD and nasal swab were collected and cultured by standard protocol. All staphylococcal isolates from any source were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method. Genotyping matching of those staphylococcal isolates was done which were isolated from different sites of the same patient, but were phonotypically similar. Genotype of blood isolate was compared with genotype of isolate from nose/IVD/skin. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent blood isolate (8.7%) followed by Candida (2.9%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS 2.6%), Pseudomonas spp. (0.4%), Klebsiella spp. (0.3%) and Escherichia coli (0.1%). Isolation of microorganisms from blood was significantly higher in patients whose skin, IVD and nose were colonized by same microorganism (P<0.001). None of the staphylococcal isolate was found to be resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). High penicillin and oxacillin resistance was present in both S. aureus (penicillin resistance; 76.8%, oxacillin resistance; 66.7%) and CoNS (penicillin resistance; 73.3%, oxacillin resistance; 60.0%). Among CoNS biotypes, S. haemolyticus was commonest blood isolate while S. epidermidis was commonest isolate from Skin/nose. Only 33.3 per cent of S. aureus blood stream infections and most of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus blood infections were IVD associated. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococci were the major causative agent of nosocomial blood stream infections. All episodes of septicaemia due to S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus were IVD associated while only 1/3 of S. aureus septicaemia was IVD associated.
TI  - Bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via PTBD.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. METHODS: A total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period July 2003 to September 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. Among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). RESULTS: A total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). Further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174 of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. No anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. The most common microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), Escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), Enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and Enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). The percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). The percentage of enzyme-producing Escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). CONCLUSION: The bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the Tokyo Guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. Thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.
TI  - Evaluation of two detection methods of microorganisms in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The performance of a bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was evaluated and validated with an automated culture system to determine its use for screening of platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and St. aureus at 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFUs) mL and stored for 5 days. DNA amplification was performed using real-time PCR. The BacT/ALERT was used as a reference method and samples were inoculated into an aerobic culture bottle; for the PCR assay, aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0 to 5 of storage. RESULTS: Real-time PCR detected only the gram-positive bacteria in PCs spiked with low bacterial titres (1 CFU mL) after 48 h; however, it was able to detect all positive samples in PCs spiked with 10 CFU mL of either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria after 48 h. In addition, real-time PCR detected all positive samples in PCs spiked with high gram-positive bacterial titres (100 CFU mL) after 24 h. On the other hand, the BacT/ALERT system showed positive results in all samples within 24 h. CONCLUSION: The BacT/ALERT method is more sensitive and should continue to be the gold standard for identifying bacterial contaminations in blood samples. The real-time PCR approach can be used for the screening of PCs for microbial detection before they are released from blood centres or shortly before they are used in blood transfusion, and thus allow an extended shelf life of the platelets.
TI  - Biodegradable tocopherol acetate as a drug carrier to prevent ureteral stent-associated infection.
AB  - Biomaterial-centred bacterial infections present common and challenging complications with medical implants like ureteral stent which provide substratum for the biofilm formation. Hence the purpose of this study is to make antibacterial stent surface with biodegradable polymer (tocopherol acetate) and anti-infective agents (norfloxacin and metronidazole) using a modified dip-coating procedure. This is done by impregnating the stent pieces in the anti-infective solution (a mixture of norfloxacin-metronidazole and polymer) for uniform surface coating (drug-carrier-coated stents). After coating, agar diffusion test was performed as qualitative test to find out the sensitivity of coated stents against the clinical isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Quantitative test was measured by calculating the numbers of adhered bacteria on coated and uncoated stents by incubating the stent pieces in artificial urine. Difference in the number of viable bacteria adhered on the surface of coated and uncoated stents were statistically calculated using chi square test with p < 0.05 considered significant. The stent colonising ability of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli in a controlled environment chamber was determined using two-challenge dose of the isolates by in vitro challenge test. In qualitative test, the zone of inhibition around the coated stents showed sensitivity against the clinical isolates. In quantitative test, the number of adhered bacteria on the surface of coated stents was reduced to a significant level (p < 0.05). The polymer, tocopherol acetate is highly biodegradable in nature. Due to its degrading ability in body tissues, it releases the anti-infective drugs at a constant and sustained rate.
TI  - Microbiology of smegma in boys in Kano, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to document the common bacteria found  in the smegma in the subpreputial space of asymptomatic boys in our environment, their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, and to determine if they differ from those commonly isolated from children with established urinary tract infections in our sub-region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2009 and January 2010, smegma swabs were collected from asymptomatic boys who presented for circumcision in our institution. This was done using aseptic techniques in the theatre, following retraction of the prepuce. The swabs were immediately sent to our microbiology laboratory for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity tests. Bacteria were isolated, identified, and confirmed by standard bacteriological techniques, and antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was determined using the disc diffusion method. A total of 52 boys, with an age range of 7 d to 11 y (median 138.7d), were recruited into the study. RESULTS: A total of 50 bacterial isolates were made. There were 29 gram-positive bacteria (58%) and 21 gram-negative ones (42%). A single isolate was found in 34 boys (65.4%), eight had a mixed isolate (15.4%), while no bacteria was isolated in 10 boys (19.2%). The most commonly isolated gram-negative bacteria was Escherichia coli (90.5%), while the commonly isolated gram-positive bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (41.4%). Most of the bacterial isolates were multi-drug-resistant. CONCLUSION: Smegma in the preputial space of children may be colonized by drug-resistant organisms, the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of which must be determined for an effective treatment of any infection arising in the region.
TI  - Preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against Escherichia coli. Herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (FQs). We have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these FQs. In contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. Our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.
TI  - Biocompatibility evaluation of a new hydrogel dressing based on polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyethylene glycol.
AB  - The composition of the dressings is based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and agar. The electron beam irradiation technique has been used to prepare hydrogel wound dressings. The in vitro biocompatibility of the hydrogel was investigated by check samples (hydrocolloid Comfeel), antibacterial test (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia Coli k12), anti fungal test (Candida Albicans) and cytotoxicity test (Fibroblast L929). Results have shown cell attachment characteristics and nontoxicity of all samples. Antibacterial testing also showed that the antibacterial effect of the hydrogel sample to the check sample increased to 30%. Also, investigation of antifungal analysis did not show any trace of fungi growth on the surface of the hydrogel, whereas antifungal effect did not observe on the surface of the check sample. Finally, this hydrogel sample showed a good in vitro biocompatibility.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  - A series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized. Antimicrobial activity assessment indicates that compounds 1, 26, 27 and 28 exhibit strong activity against gram-positive bacterial strains, including Beta-hemolytic streptococcus CMCC32210, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA). Compound 27 shows the best anti-MRSA activity with an MIC value of 0.031 mug/ml. To assess the mechanism of action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV were also measured. The results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supercoiling activity and S. aureus Topo IV relaxing activity.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Rosemary.
AB  - The composition of the essential oil of Rosemary was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 22 components, which constitute 97.41% of the oil, were identified. The major constituents were 1,8-Cineole (26.54%) and alpha-Pinene (20.14%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill dynamic processes against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis), three Gram-negative bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) were determined for the oil, 1,8-Cineole and alpha-Pinene. The oil showed pronounced antibacterial and antifungal activity than 1,8-Cineole and alpha-Pinene against all of the tested microbes. Furthermore, the survival rates and morphological changes of S. aureus after treatment with different concentrations of the essential oil were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
TI  - Rising incidence of acute prostatitis following prostate biopsy: fluoroquinolone  resistance and exposure is a significant risk factor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and potential risk factors for infection-related complications after transrectal prostate biopsy and to propose adjustments in current antimicrobial prophylaxis recommendations. METHODS: During 2008-2010, 107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate at our institution. Charts were reviewed for infection-related complications within 30 days of the procedure. Potential risk factors were evaluated, including age, diabetes mellitus, chronic constipation/diverticular disease, prior use of quinolones, enema and prostatitis, on the pathology report. For patients with acute prostatitis, urine and blood samples were assessed for bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: Of our 107 patients, acute prostatitis developed in 10 (9.3%). The most significant risk factor was prior use of a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial, with acute prostatitis developing in 7 (17.1%) of 41 patients who had used a fluoroquinolone compared with 3 (4.5%) of 66 patients who had not (P=.042). Patients who received an enema before the procedure were slightly less likely to develop prostatitis (P=.061). Of 8 positive specimens, the organisms isolated were Escherichia coli in 6, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one. Isolated Gram-negative organisms were fluoroquinolone-resistant in 85.7% of samples. CONCLUSION: Prior fluoroquinolone intake is a significant risk factor behind a rising incidence of acute prostatitis after transrectal prostate biopsy. Identified pathogens are mostly Gram-negative organisms with a high rate of fluoroquinolone resistance. Alternative prophylaxis regimens for the biopsy procedure should be considered in patients with recent quinolone intake.
TI  - Preparation of airborne Ag/CNT hybrid nanoparticles using an aerosol process and  their application to antimicrobial air filtration.
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used in a variety of applications because of their unique structure and excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Additionally, silver (Ag) nanoparticles exhibit broad-spectrum biocidal activity toward many different bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In this study, we prepared Ag-coated CNT hybrid nanoparticles (Ag/CNTs) using aerosol nebulization and thermal evaporation/condensation processes and tested their usefulness for antimicrobial air filtration. Droplets were generated from a CNT suspension using a six-jet collison nebulizer, passed through a diffusion dryer to remove moisture, and entered a thermal tube furnace where silver nanoparticles were generated by thermal evaporation/condensation at approximately 980 degrees C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The CNT and Ag nanoparticle aerosols mixed together and attached to each other, forming Ag/CNTs. For physicochemical characterization, the Ag/CNTs were introduced into a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) for size distribution measurements and were sampled by the nanoparticle sampler for morphological and elemental analyses. For antimicrobial air filtration applications, the airborne Ag/CNT particles generated were deposited continuously onto an air filter medium. Physical characteristics (fiber morphology, pressure drop, and filtration efficiency) and biological characteristics (antimicrobial tests against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli bioaerosols) were evaluated. Real-time SMPS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data showed that Ag nanoparticles that were <20 nm in diameter were homogeneously dispersed and adhered strongly to the CNT surfaces. Because of the attachment of Ag nanoparticles onto the CNT surfaces, the total particle surface area concentration measured by a nanoparticle surface area monitor (NSAM) was lower than the summation of each Ag nanoparticle and CNT generated. When Ag/CNTs were deposited on the surface of an air filter medium, the antimicrobial activity against test bacterial bioaerosols was enhanced, compared with the deposition of CNTs or Ag nanoparticles alone, whereas the filter pressure drop and bioaerosol filtration efficiency were similar to those of CNT deposition only. At a residence time of 2 h, the relative microbial viabilities of gram-positive S. epidermidis were approximately 32, 13, 5, and 0.9% on the control, CNT-, Ag nanoparticle-, and Ag/CNT-deposited filters, respectively, and those of gram-negative E. coli were 13, 2.1, 0.4, and 0.1% on the control, CNTs, Ag nanoparticles, and Ag/CNTs, respectively. These Ag/CNT hybrid nanoparticles may be useful for applications in biomedical devices and antibacterial control systems.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry has been used to measure the volatile compounds occurring in the headspace of urine samples inoculated with common urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing microbes Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans. This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.
TI  - Establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: ISBT working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (WP-TTID), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B-06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B-20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B-08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B-19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. RESULTS: Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee Biological Standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.
TI  - Surface acoustic waves increase the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections resulting from prolonged patient catheterization have become a major health problem. One of the major issues is bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatments due to biofilm formation inside the catheters, thus enhancing the search for alternative treatments. In the present study, a device containing a piezo element capable of transmitting low-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAW) onto the indwelling catheter was used. The SAW were able to eradicate biofilm-residing bacteria by >85% when applied simultaneously with an antibiotic in three clinically relevant species, viz. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that SAW can alter the transcription pattern of P. aeruginosa, suggesting that this signal can be specifically sensed by the bacterium.
TI  - Combating bacterial colonization on metals via polymer coatings: relevance to marine and medical applications.
AB  - Metals are widely used in engineering as well as medical applications. However, their surfaces are easily colonized by bacteria that form biofilms. Among the numerous concerns with biofilm formation, biocorrosion is of particular importance in industry, because structural integrity may be compromised, leading to technical failures. In the food industry and medical field, biofilms also pose health risks. To inhibit bacterial colonization, the surfaces of metals can be coated with a polymeric layer which is antiadhesive and/or bactericidal. This article describes polymers that have these desired properties and the methodologies for immobilizing them on metal surfaces of relevance to the marine and medical fields. The focus is on polymer coatings that have a high degree of stability in aqueous medium and do not leach out. The efficacies of the different polymer coatings against bacteria commonly encountered in marine (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and medical applications (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) are demonstrated.
TI  - Long-term fluoroquinolone use before the prostate biopsy may increase the risk of sepsis caused by resistant microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of long-term fluoroquinolone treatment before  the biopsy in terms of post procedure sepsis. Three-week fluoroquinolone management before the biopsy may lower serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and prevent unnecessary biopsies. METHODS: A total of 558 patients were referred to our clinic for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. Of the patients, 205 had received levofloxacin 500 mg once a day for 3 weeks before the biopsy to lower the serum PSA levels (group 1). A total of 353 patients had not received any antibiotics before the procedure (group 2). In terms of the postbiopsy sepsis rate, group 1 and group 2 as well as patients who underwent biopsies in the early period and the latter period of the study were compared. RESULTS: Sepsis was diagnosed in 17 patients (3.0%) after biopsy. Of these patients, 11 (5.4%) and 6 (1.7%) were in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = .0297, OR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.10-10.13). Sepsis was diagnosed in 7 patients (1.9%) and 10 patients (5.0%) in the early and the latter period of the study, respectively (P = .0771, OR: 0.38, 95% CI: .13-1.09). Escherichia coli was the causative agent in all patients with a positive culture. In addition, 1 patient also had meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). All of the E. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 55.6% were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term fluoroquinolone use to prevent unnecessary prostate biopsy may result in postbiopsy sepsis caused by fluoroquinolone resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and various extracts of fruits of greater cardamom.
AB  - Greater cardamom (Amomum subulatum Roxb. Zingiberaceae) commonly known as "Bari ilaichi" is a well known plant used in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. It has been used for the treatment of various diseases and disorders like gastric ulcer. Therefore antimicrobial activity of petroleum ether, methanol and aqueous extracts from leaves and roots, essential oil and isolated vasicine from A. vasica were tested against various microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity was done by disc diffusion method. The zone of inhibition observed was compared with that of standard drugs, ciprofloxacin and fluconazole. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined against microorganisms used in the study. The results of this study reveal that methanol extract of fruits of A. subulatum shows remarkable antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli whereas in case of other microorganisms used it was found inferior to the standard drug used. Methanol extract of rind showed good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that the essential oil isolated was effective against majority of microorganisms used viz. Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Decreasing bacterial colonization of external fixation pins through nitric oxide  release coatings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection of the pin tract represents the most common complication associated with external fixation. This study was designed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing xerogel films applied to commercially pure titanium pins in a rat model. METHODS: Pins were coated with xerogel solution through a dip-coating procedure. Half of the xerogel-coated implant pins were modified into NO donors and served as the NO-releasing group, whereas the remaining pins were left unmodified to serve as non-NO-releasing xerogel-coated controls. Acid-etched pins served as uncoated controls. Animal selection was randomized and every rat had one pin from each of the three groups randomly allocated to the third, fourth, or fifth tail vertebrae. Quantification of bacterial infection was performed 48 days postoperatively and the tissue-implant interface was inspected for clinical signs of infection on Days 14 and 28 postimplantation. RESULTS: Pin tract bacterial colony counts of the NO-releasing group (170,000 +/- 181,000) were significantly lower than both the xerogel-coated group (677,000 +/- 675,000) and the control group (1,181,000 +/- 2,717,000) 48 days postoperatively (P < 0.05). No significant difference in colony counts was observed between the xerogel-coated group and the control group. The NO-releasing group also had significantly fewer clinical signs of infection than both the coated and the control groups on postoperative Day 28 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of NO-releasing xerogel coatings can inhibit bacterial colonization of external fixation pins both during the initial postsurgical period and up to 48 days postimplantation.
TI  - Initial efforts toward the optimization of arylomycins for antibiotic activity.
AB  - While most clinically used antibiotics were derived from natural products, the isolation of new broad-spectrum natural products has become increasingly rare and narrow-spectrum agents are typically deemed unsuitable for development because of intrinsic limitations of their scaffold or target. However, it is possible that the spectrum of a natural product antibiotic might be limited by specific resistance mechanisms in some bacteria, such as target mutations, and the spectra of such "latent" antibiotics might be reoptimized by derivatization, just as has been done with clinically deployed antibiotics. We recently showed that the spectrum of the arylomycin natural product antibiotics, which act via the novel mechanism of inhibiting type I signal peptidase, is broader than previously believed and that resistance in several key human pathogens is due to the presence of a specific Pro residue in the target peptidase that disrupts interactions with the lipopeptide tail of the antibiotic. To begin to test whether this natural resistance might be overcome by derivatization, we synthesized analogues with altered lipopeptide tails and identified several with an increased spectrum of activity against S. aureus. The data support the hypothesis that the arylomycins are latent antibiotics, suggest that their spectrum may be optimized by derivatization, and identify a promising scaffold upon which future optimization efforts might focus.
TI  - Surfactant free rapid synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanorods by a microwave irradiation method for the treatment of bone infection.
AB  - Mesoporous nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHAp) rods of size 40-75 nm long and 25 nm wide (resembling bone mineral) were synthesized under microwave irradiation without using any surfactants or modifiers. The surface area and average pore size of the nHAp were found to be 32 m(2) g(-1) and 4 nm, respectively. Rifampicin (RIF) and ciprofloxacin (CPF) loaded nHAp displayed an initial burst followed by controlled release (zero order kinetics). Combination of CPF and RIF loaded nHAp showed enhanced bacterial growth inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) compared to individual agent loaded nHAp and pure nHAp. In addition, decreased bacterial adhesion (90%) was observed on the surface of CPF plus RIF loaded nHAp. The biocompatibility test toward MG63 cells infected with micro-organisms showed better cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) for the combination of CPF and RIF loaded nHAp. The influence on cell viability of infected MG63 cells was attributed to the simultaneous and controlled release of CPF and RIF from nHAp, which prevented the emergence of subpopulations that were resistant to each other. Hence, apart from the issue of the rapid synthesis of nHAp without surfactants or modifiers, the simultaneous and controlled release of dual drugs from nHAp would be a simple, non-toxic and cost-effective method to treat bone infections.
TI  - Research in practice: Antimicrobial peptides of the skin.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides represent evolutionary ancient molecules whose importance  became evident within the last years. These highly effective peptides protect the skin and other epithelia against infection and form a fast acting "chemical barrier" also regulating the normal flora of the skin and mucosa. In the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Kiel, various antimicrobial peptides have been discovered, characterized and investigated in healthy persons as well as in different skin diseases. Everyday clinical observations formed the background for several interesting hypotheses and findings.
TI  - Chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of essential Oil of Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. Pubescens varieties from China.
AB  - The essential oils of Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. Pubescens, Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. Gracilis, Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. Heterocycla and Phyllostachys kwangsiensis leaves were obtained by steam distillation. Their chemical components were separated and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Meanwhile, the effect of scavenging free radicals of essential oil was assayed by using the DPPH.method with Trolox(R) as control to evaluate their antioxidant capacities. Gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) were selected as the indicator microorganisms to evaluate the antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial properties were estimated by the agar diffusion method. The results show that 63 components were separated and identified by GC/MS from these varieties of bamboo leaves. cis-3-Hexenol, whose content in cv. Pubescens, Gracilis, Heterocycla and Ph. kwangsiensis was 27.11%, 24.62%, 30.51% and 34.65%, respectively, was the main constituent. The relative content of alcohol compounds in these varieties of essential oils ranged from 39.8% to 46.64%. All of the bamboo leaf essential oils possessed certain antioxidant capacity; the corresponding IC(5)(0) values were 3.1622, 4.9353, 4.2473, and 5.4746 muL/mL, respectively. Essential oils of all tested bamboo spp. were active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli, showing a positive correlation with the essential oil concentration of 50.42-300 muL/mL. The results indicated there were no significant differences among three varieties and the related species with respect to their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. This paper provides evidence for studying the essential composition from different varieties of bamboo leaves.
TI  - Broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by Kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  - Cell-free extracts prepared from Kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and K. kingae. The extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. Chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the K. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. Structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides. One was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-GlcNAcp-(1-->5)-beta-d-OclAp-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. The second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated PAM galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->. Purified PAM galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. A cluster of three K. kingae genes encoding UDP-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of PAM galactan in Escherichia coli. PAM galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. The biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants against clinical isolates of oral cancer cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppression of immune system in treated cancer patients may lead to secondary infections that obviate the need of antibiotics. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the occurrence of secondary infections in immuno-suppressed patients along with herbal control of these infections with the following objectives to: (a) isolate the microbial species from the treated oral cancer patients along with the estimation of absolute neutrophile counts of patients (b) assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity medicinal plants against the above clinical isolates. METHODS: Blood and oral swab cultures were taken from 40 oral cancer patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D.S. Health University,Rohtak, Haryana. Clinical isolates were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. The medicinal plants selected for antimicrobial activity analysis were Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav., Asparagus racemosus Willd., Balanites aegyptiaca L., Cestrum diurnum L., Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Eclipta alba L., Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng. , Pedalium murex L., Ricinus communis L. and Trigonella foenum graecum L. The antimicrobial efficacy of medicinal plants was evaluated by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. MIC and MFC were investigated by serial two fold microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%), Escherichia coli (15.62%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.37%), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.81%), Proteus mirabilis (3.6%), Proteus vulgaris (4.2%) and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans (14.6%), Aspergillus fumigatus (9.37%). Out of 40 cases, 35 (87.5%) were observed as neutropenic. Eight medicinal plants (A. tenuifolius, A. racemosus, B. aegyptiaca, E. alba, M. koenigii, P. murex R. communis and T. foenum graecum) showed significant antimicrobial activity (P < .05) against most of the isolates. The MIC and MFC values were ranged from 31 to 500 mug/ml. P. aeruginosa was observed highest susceptible bacteria (46.6%) on the basis of susceptible index. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treated oral cancer patients were neutropenic and prone to secondary infection of microbes. The medicinal plant can prove as effective antimicrobial agent to check the secondary infections in treated cancer patients.
TI  - Cyclodextrin and maltodextrin finishing of a polypropylene abdominal wall implant for the prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a polypropylene (PP) artificial abdominal wall implant for the prolonged release of ciprofloxacin (CFX). This sustained release effect was obtained by functionalization of the textile mesh with citric acid and hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HPgammaCD) or maltodextrin (MD). In both cases the textile finishing reaction yielded a cyclo- or malto-dextrin crosslinked polymer coating the fibers. The modified supports were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The sorption capacities and the kinetics of CFX release were studied by batch tests coupled with spectrophotometric assays. Microbiological assays were carried out on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, while proliferation and viability tests used fibroblasts. The main results were as follows. (i) Due to the differences between the range of temperature of thermal degradation of the (cyclo)dextrins polymers and of the PP fibers TGA was a reliable method for quantifying the degree of functionalization of the textiles. (ii) Both modified supports showed improved sorption/desorption capacities for CFX, compared with the virgin mesh. The HPgammaCD-finished support showed an increased sorption capacity and a lower release rate of CFX compared with the MD modified support. (iii) Microbiological assays confirmed the latter result, with greater sustained antibacterial activity of the HPgammaCD treated support. These experiments have demonstrated the role of the cyclodextrin cavity in interactions with CFX: the antibiotic was not only adsorbed via hydrogen and acid-base interactions with the polyCTR-HPgammaCD network, but also via host-guest complexation. (iv) Biological tests revealed a slight decrease in fibroblast proliferation after 6 days on the modified supports, but cell viability tests showed that this was not due to toxicity of the (cyclo)dextrin polymer coatings.
TI  - Synthesis of GTMAC modified chitin-PAA gel and evaluation of its biological properties.
AB  - The dressing prepared from GTMAC modified chitin-PAA was introduced with the aim  of facilitating wound healing, particularly those effectively absorbing exudates, maintaining a moist wound environment and controlling bacterial proliferation. Chitin was chemically modified with acrylic acid to encourage a moist wound healing environment. The highly water-absorbable resulting product (chitin-PAA) was further reacted with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) to impart antibacterial activities. The final product, chitin-PAA-GTMAC was characterized by the techniques of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), solid state (15) N NMR, and elemental analysis. Their cytotoxicity and antibacterial activities against S. epidermidis and E. coli were evaluated which found increasing effects in those properties with increasing degree substitution of GTMAC. All materials also showed good blood-clotting ability. The collagen gel contraction assay was used to analyze the behavior of fibroblasts after contact with the gels. The extent of the gel contraction as well as the examination of the secreted interleukin-8 (IL-8) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) were investigated. The results showed that chitin-PAA modified with GTMAC could stimulate the production of IL-8, but TGF-beta1. Fibroblasts presented normal spreading and formation of cellular processes in the collagen gels with all of the modifications. Furthermore, all modified gels except for the highest GTMAC content gel [chitin-PAA-GTMAC (1:20)] were found a greater extent in gel contraction than the unmodified chitin-PAA. It suggested the promoting effect of GTMAC on cell proliferation if the GTMAC content in the gel was not too high, that is, the mole ratio of glucosamine to GTMAC of the gel should not greater than 1:10.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - In vitro study of antibacterial activity of the alga Sargassum oligocystum from the Persian Gulf.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With due attention to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, discovering of new antibacterial compounds is needed. Algae produce numerous bioactive substances which may have pharmacological properties such as antibacterial activity. The objective of this investigation was to in vitro study of antibacterial activity of brown alga Sargassum oligocystum collected along the Bushehr coast of Persian Gulf (south west of Iran). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hot water extract, cold water extract, and hot glycerin extract were prepared. The effect of the extracts were investigated on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). RESULTS: Hot water extract exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cold water extract and hot glycerin extract did not show antibacterial activity on any of the four test bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of hot water extract for both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 3.175 mg/ml. However, the MIC of this extract for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9.556 mg/ml. DISCUSSION: In this study gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to hot water extract than gram-negative bacteria. Extract of Sargassum oligocystum could be a candidate for purification and further in vivo studies.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Infections in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor antagonists: incidence, etiology and mortality in the BIOBADASER registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Whether the use of tumor necrosis factor antagonists increases the risk of infection remains a subject of open debate. Developing effective strategies of prevention and empirical treatment entails carefully establishing the etiology and prognosis of the infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis of the Spanish registry BIOBADASER (Feb-2000 to Jan-2006), a national drug safety registry of patients with rheumatic diseases. RESULTS: 907 episodes of infection occurring in 6,969 patients were analyzed. The infection incidence observed was 53.09 cases/1,000 patients-years (CI 95% 49.69-56.66). The most frequent infections were skin infection (12.18 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), pneumonia (5.97 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), cystitis (3.92 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), tuberculosis (3.51 cases/1,000 patients-yrs) and arthritis (3.76 cases/1,000 patients-yrs). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella spp. emerged as important pathogens. Varicella zoster virus and Herpes simplex virus caused most cases of viral infections. Mucocutaneous candidiasis accounted for most fungal infections. Mortality was increased in infected patients (log-rank test p<0.0001). Pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, abdominal infection and endocarditis were associated with significant attributable mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of bacterial, viral and fungal infections occurred in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with TNF antagonists. The information of this study can illuminate clinicians globally on how to address infection in this vulnerable group of patients.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - [Photoinduced bactericidal activity of TiO2 films].
AB  - A decline in CFU of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria on the surface of UV illuminated TiO2 films (wavelength of 380 nm) is shown. A 29, 45, and 47% decrease in bacterial viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, respectively, was seen following a 12-min exposition. It was first discovered that the reuse of TiO2 films to test a bacterial suspension for viability removes UV-induced bactericidal activity. However, annealing of TiO2 at a temperature above 400 degrees C restores the photoinduced bactericidal activity to its initial state.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - Peptide mimics of peptidoglycan are vaccine candidates and protect mice from infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus drug resistance to antibiotics is a serious situation that  has drawn greater attention to immunotherapy and prophylaxis. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a common and conserved component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus. However, PGN, as a thymus-independent antigen, cannot be considered a vaccine candidate because of its very weak immunogenicity. In this study we have attempted to enhance the immunogenicity of PGN by identifying a PGN peptide mimic sequence that would act as a thymus-dependent antigen. Several peptide sequences were obtained from a phage display peptide library using a mAb against S. aureus PGN, and a 12-mer linear single peptide (Sp-31) and a four-branch multiple antigen peptide (MAP) (MAP-P31) were synthesized. Both Sp-31 and MAP-P31 were shown to bind directly to anti-PGN mAb and a polyclonal antibody against S. aureus. These peptides could also inhibit the binding of PGN to a mAb against PGN. Furthermore, MAP-P31 was able to provoke an effective secondary antibody response in mice to PGN and to cell-wall fragments isolated from S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by sonication. In addition, the MAP-P31 antiserum showed a potent bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus in the presence and absence of complement in vitro. Importantly, immunization with MAP-P31 significantly prolonged the survival and enhanced bacterial clearance in BALB/c mice challenged with live S. aureus. In addition, the serum IgG-type antibodies against PGN persisted in mice, demonstrating that MAP-P31, as a peptide mimicking epitopes on PGN, provokes an effective secondary or memory antibody response, which can only be induced by a thymus-dependent antigen and which protects against infection with S. aureus. These results suggest that MAP-31 may be a novel vaccine candidate against S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Anthriscus nemorosa root essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from the roots of Anthriscus nemorosa (Bieb.) Sprengel (Umbelliferae) was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Among sixty-two compounds identified (representing 89.0% of the total oil), the main components were: n-nonane (12.1%), n-hexadecanol (6.9%), delta-cadinene (6.4%), beta-pinene (6.0%) and germacrene D (5.4%). Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of the oil was evaluated against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and a yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC 24433) using the broth microdilution method.
TI  - A type IV modification-dependent restriction enzyme SauUSI from Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300.
AB  - A gene encoding a putative DNA helicase from Staphylococcus aureus USA300 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified to over 90% purity by chromatography. The purified enzyme, SauUSI, predominantly cleaves modified DNA containing 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Cleavage of 5mC-modified plasmids indicated that the sites S5mCNGS (S = C or G) are preferentially digested. The endonuclease activity requires the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or dATP whereas the non-hydrolyzable gamma-S-ATP does not support activity. SauUSI activity was inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. It is most active in Mg(++) buffers. No companion methylase gene was found near the SauUSI restriction gene. The absence of a cognate methylase and cleavage of modified DNA indicate that SauUSI belongs to type IV restriction endonucleases, a group that includes EcoK McrBC and Mrr. SauUSI belongs to a family of highly similar homologs found in other sequenced S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. carnosus genomes. More distant SauUSI orthologs can be found in over 150 sequenced bacterial/archaea genomes. Finally, we demonstrated the biological function of the type IV REase in restricting 5mC-modified plasmid DNA by transformation into clinical S. aureus strain SA564, and in restricting phage lambda infection when the endonuclease is expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Light-induced antibacterial activity of symmetrical and asymmetrical oligophenylene ethynylenes.
AB  - The light-induced antibacterial activity of symmetric and asymmetric oligophenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) was investigated against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. To understand the light-induced biocidal effect better, the transient absorption and triplet lifetime of OPEs were studied in methanol and water. A higher triplet lifetime was observed for OPE samples in water than in methanol. The magnitudes of the changes in optical density (DeltaOD) of the S-OPE-n(H) series of symmetric oligomers are much higher than that of the asymmetric OPE-n series in water and are generally correlated with the singlet oxygen yield. It was found that the antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is size-, concentration-, and time-dependent. The light-induced antibacterial activity may result from the coordinated interactions of membrane disruption and interfacial or intracellular singlet oxygen generation, and the dominant factor is most likely the latter. The results obtained in this study will aid in the design of more efficient biocides in the future.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections: results of the OASIS multicenter study.
AB  - Beginning on April 2007, a prospective multicenter study was performed to investigate prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Twenty microbiology laboratories participated to the survey over a 1-year period. A total of 11,638 episodes of BSI occurred in 11 202 patients, with 8.5% (n=985) of episodes being polymicrobial. Of 12 781 causative organisms, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were 47.4% (n=6058), whereas Gram-positives accounted for 43.9% (n=5608). The remaining organisms included fungal species (n=924, 7.2%) and anaerobes (n=191, 1.5%). The most prevalent agents were Escherichia coli (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%), and Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%). Isolates recovered from patients admitted to medical, surgical, and intensive care units accounted for 62.9%, 17.7%, and 19.4% of cases, respectively. BSIs were classified as hospital-acquired in 67.2% of cases. Compared with previous studies, our data show an increasing role of Gram-negative bacteria among both hospital- and community-acquired blood isolates.
TI  - Improving the antibacterial property of porcine small intestinal submucosa by nano-silver supplementation: a promising biological material to address the need for contaminated defect repair.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that introduction of nano-silver particles to porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (NS-PSIS) would lead to significant enhancement in antibacterial property in repairing contaminated abdominal defect. BACKGROUND: Porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (PSIS) is an acellular and xenogenic biological material intensively used in repairing and regenerating wounded and dysfunctional tissues. Surgical site infection (SSI) remains so far a serious problem and major challenge, particularly in contaminated tissue-deficient repairing. METHODS: Self-assembly was used to fabricate NS-PSIS. The antibacterial property was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by means of repairing full-thickness contaminated abdominal defect in rats. The native PSIS and polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose were served as controls. In addition, changes in biomechanical resistance, morphology and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory reaction and neovasculation in the repaired abdominal wall were analyzed. Biosafety was investigated by pyrogen test, skin irritation test and silver measurement in vivo. RESULTS: NS-PSIS exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on agar diffusion, with mean diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 11.9 to 23.5 mm. There were significantly lower SSI incidence and a tendency of better abdominal wall resistance in the NS-PSIS group as compared with the PSIS or polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose group after repairing contaminated abdominal defect in rats. Nano-silver modified PSIS did not change the native PSIS property in the tissue recolonization, remodeling and neovascularization. NS-PSIS was not pyrogenic or skin irritated, without silver residual in vivo after repairing contaminated abdominal defect. CONCLUSION: Nano-silver particles to PSIS lead to significant enhancements in antibacterial property in vitro and in vivo without decreasing its biomechanical resistance and biocompatibility. This study provides proof of concept for the use of nano-silver modified naturally derived PSIS as an ideal scaffold for SSI prevention in the contaminated tissue-deficient repair.
TI  - The importance of staphylococci and threshold value of somatic cell count for diagnosis of sub-clinical mastitis in Pirlak sheep at mid-lactation.
AB  - This study investigated the bacterial agents causing sub-clinical mastitis and the mean somatic cell counts (SCC) of milk in Pirlak sheep at mid-lactation. The percentage of infected udder halves was 11.4% (53/464). The most frequently isolated species were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (64.2%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (24.5%) and Escherichia coli (11.3%). Among the CNS, the most common species was Staphylococcus epidermidis (38.2%). The other species isolated from milk samples were Staphylococcus xylosus (17.7%), Staphylococcus chromogenes (14.7%), Staphylococcus simulans (8.8%) and Staphylococcus hyicus (8.8%). The mean SCC for culture positive and negative samples was 1742x10(3) and 161x10(3) cells/ml, respectively. A significant difference (p<0.05) was determined between with and without microbial growth groups in terms of the SCC values. Threshold limit for SCC was 374x10(3) cells/ml for Pirlak sheep. In conclusion, it was considered that SCC is an important predictor of sub-clinical mastitis in Pirlak sheep. This is the first study to describe the bacterial agents causing sub-clinical mastitis and threshold limit for SCC in Pirlak sheep in Turkey.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of five needleless intravenous connectors.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro differences of colony forming units (CFUs), of four different bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), over 4 days, using bovine blood, in five intravenous needleless connectors (three negative, one positive, one zero). BACKGROUND: Availability of colony forming units creates a definitive environment for bloodstream infections and occlusions. Protection of the intraluminal pathway is one important way to help eliminate occlusions and catheter-related bloodstream infections and utilization of best available product(s) will aid in best patient outcomes. METHODS: Five different connectors evaluated in 2009 by an independent laboratory for in vitro differences about colony forming units of four different organisms over 4 days. RESULTS: The Q-Syte performed poorly on all organisms (P<0.0001). The MaxPlus((R)) Clear and MicroCLAVE((R)) fluctuated between high colony forming units (28.15 & 56.55 respectively) and zero colony forming units. The TKOClave((R)) stayed increased (high of 50.8 colony forming units). The RyMed-5001((R)) performed the best with very low colony forming units (2.25 CFUs to zero). CONCLUSIONS: Non-antimicrobial connectors differ on colony forming unit counts in vitro for four types of bacteria. Connectors with most colony forming units to least colony forming units included the Q-Syte, TKOClave((R)), MicroCLAVE((R)), MaxPlus((R)) Clear and RyMed-5001((R)). Connectors are one statistically significant variable (50%) in the development of occlusions and infections. Staff nurses, managers, infection control specialists and vascular access specialists in all settings need to use technologies that invoke the least patient harm. The RyMed-5001((R)) connector best protects the intraluminal pathway from bacteria compared with four other commonly used connectors in vitro.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Bloodstream infection after positive catheter cultures: what are the risks in the intensive care unit when catheters are routinely cultured on removal?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess whether an isolated positive catheter culture is predictive of a subsequent bloodstream infection in intensive care unit patients. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study between 2000 and 2007. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a university hospital. SUBJECTS: All arterial, central venous, and dialysis catheters yielding selected pathogenic microorganisms from isolated positive catheter cultures. Positive catheter culture was defined by a catheter tip culture performed with the Brun-Buisson technique yielding >/=103 colony-forming units/mL; isolated positive catheter culture by a positive catheter culture without concomitant bloodstream infection due to the microorganism of the positive catheter culture evidenced within 48 hrs before or after catheter removal; and subsequent bloodstream infection by a bloodstream infection developing between 48 hrs and 30 days after catheter removal and due to a selected pathogenic microorganism of an isolated positive catheter culture. Active antibiotic therapy was active if at least one of the antibiotics administered was effective against the selected pathogenic microorganism of the positive catheter culture. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The end point of the study was the ratio of the number of subsequent bloodstream infections to that of selected pathogenic microorganisms isolated from positive catheter culture 30 days after catheter removal. A total of 138 isolated positive catheter cultures for 149 selected pathogenic micro-organisms was included in the study. Only two cases (1.3%) of subsequent bloodstream infection were evidenced, one resulting from Escherichia coli and the other from Staphylococcus epidermidis. The incidence of subsequent bloodstream infection did not differ with regard to the presence or absence of active antibiotics at catheter removal: zero of 23 vs. two of 121 (p = 1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the risk of subsequent bloodstream infection in intensive care unit patients when the Brun-Buisson technique is used to define isolated positive catheter culture is low.
TI  - Titania-silver and alumina-silver composite nanoparticles: novel, versatile synthesis, reaction mechanism and potential antimicrobial application.
AB  - Titania-silver (TiO(2)-Ag) and alumina-silver (Al(2)O(3)-Ag) composite nanoparticles were synthesised by a simple, reproducible, wet chemical method under ambient conditions. The surface of the oxides was modified with oleic acid, which acted as an intermediate between the oxide surface and the silver nanoparticles. The resulting composite nanoparticles were thoroughly characterised by XRD, TEM, XPS, FTIR and TGA to elucidate the mode of assembly of Ag nanoparticles on the oxide surfaces. Epoxy nanocomposites were formulated with TiO(2)-Ag and Al(2)O(3)-Ag to examine potential applications for the composite nanoparticles. Preliminary results from disc diffusion assays against Escherichia coli DH5alpha and Staphylococcus epidermidis NCIMB 12721 suggest that these TiO(2)-Ag and Al(2)O(3)-Ag composite nanoparticles have potential as antimicrobial materials.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-alkoxyimino-5-amino/methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - We report herein the design and synthesis of novel 7-(3-alkoxyimino-5-amino/methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives based on the structures of new fluoroquinolones IMB and DZH. The antibacterial activity of these newly synthesized compounds was also evaluated and compared with gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Results revealed that all of the target compounds 10-27 have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MSSA (MIC: 0.125-8 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.25-16 mug/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC: 0.125-4 mug/mL), and Escherichia coli (MIC: 0.25-0.5 mug/mL). In particular, some compounds showed useful activity against several fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the most active compound 15 was found to be 16-128, 2-32, and 4-8-fold more potent than the three reference drugs against fluoroquinolone-resistant MSSA, MRSA, and MRSE.
TI  - Synthesis of cationic antimicrobial beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives with potential for oral administration.
AB  - We have prepared a series of highly potent achiral cationic beta(2,2)-amino acid  derivatives that fulfill the Lipinski's rule of five and that contain the basic structural requirements of short cationic antimicrobial peptides. Highest antimicrobial potency was observed for one of the smallest beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives (M(w) 423.6) exhibiting a MIC of 3.8 muM against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and Staphylococcus aureus, and 7.7 muM against Escherichia coli. The beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives were shown to have similar absorption properties as several commercially available drugs, and the results implied a resembling membrane disrupting mechanism of action as reported for much larger cationic antimicrobial peptides. By their high potency, nontoxicity, absorption properties, and ease of synthesis, the beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives demonstrate a way to modify a vastly investigated class of cationic antimicrobial peptides into small drug-like molecules with high commercial potential.
TI  - A comparative study of sterility levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritonitis remains a serious risk associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), although better patient education programs and such technological advances as improved automated connecting devices have greatly decreased its incidence over the past 20 years. The automated devices have a good resistance to contamination, but they rely on an external electrical power source and are not easily portable. There has, therefore, been a need for a highly sterile nonelectric manual connecting device to complement the automated devices already in use. Such a manual device has recently been developed. We compared the level of sterility after touch contamination in this new device with levels in 2 other connecting devices: a conventional device with a manual cap (JMS Co. Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan), and a powered total containment device (JMS Co. Ltd.). METHOD: Five bacteria frequently causing CAPD-related peritonitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) were separately applied to the tip of each connecting device, and peritoneal washing fluid was injected as in a routine exchange. We used a membrane filter method to determine whether the route had been contaminated by the washing fluid. RESULTS: In the conventional device with a manual cap, 3 to 4 colony-forming units (CFUs) of S. aureus were detected in 2 of 10 drainage samples, 8 CFUs of E. coli in 1 of 10 drainage samples, and 1 CFU of E. coli in the injection fluid. In contrast, no contamination was detected in the automated connecting device or the new manual cap device. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the new device has a risk of touch contamination lower than that of the conventional manual cap device and equal to that of the automated device. Being easily portable and not reliant on an external power source, the new device should be useful in various situations.
TI  - Structural evidence of alpha-aminoacylated lipoproteins of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacterial lipoproteins are known to be diacylated or triacylated and activate mammalian immune cells via Toll-like receptor 2/6 or 2/1 heterodimer. Because the genomes of low G+C content gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, do not contain Escherichia coli-type apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase, an enzyme converting diacylated lipoproteins into triacylated forms, it has been widely believed that native lipoproteins of S. aureus are diacylated. However, we recently demonstrated that one lipoprotein SitC purified from S. aureus RN4220 strain was triacylated. Almost simultaneously, another group reported that another lipoprotein SA2202 purified from S. aureus SA113 strain was diacylated. The determination of exact lipidated structures of S. aureus lipoproteins is thus crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of host-microorganism interactions. Toward this purpose, we intensively used MS-based analyses. Here, we demonstrate that SitC lipoprotein of S. aureus RN4220 strain has two lipoprotein lipase-labile O-esterified fatty acids and one lipoprotein lipase-resistant fatty acid. Further MS/MS analysis of the lipoprotein lipase digest revealed that the lipoprotein lipase-resistant fatty acid was acylated to alpha-amino group of the N-terminal cysteine residue of SitC. Triacylated forms of SitC with various length fatty acids were also confirmed in cell lysate of the RN4220 and Triton X-114 phase in three other S. aureus strains, including SA113 strain and one Staphylococcus epidermidis strain. Moreover, four other major lipoproteins including SA2202 in S. aureus strains were identified as N-acylated. These results strongly suggest that lipoproteins of S. aureus are mainly in the N-acylated triacyl form.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - "Scrub the hub": cleaning duration and reduction in bacterial load on central venous catheters.
AB  - This article reports the results of a study on the effect of alcohol disinfection duration on bacterial load on catheter hubs. Three different levels of disinfection (3, 10, and 15 seconds) were analyzed as well as a positive and negative control. All hubs with the exception of the negative controls were contaminated with a 10 bacterial solution and allowed to dry for 24 hours. Through each hub, 1 mL of sterile saline was flushed; a 10-muL calibrated loop was used to plate the flush onto blood agar. Colony counts were performed on the plates after a 24-hour incubation period. Results revealed that the 3 different levels of disinfection duration were not found to differ significantly in reduction in bacterial load. The duration of disinfection did not significantly change the bacterial load on the hub. However, any disinfection duration significantly decreased the bacterial load as compared to the positive control. A larger study would likely detect a significant result among the disinfections.
TI  - Application of air ions for bacterial de-colonization in air filters contaminated by aerosolized bacteria.
AB  - We aerosolized the Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.  epidermidis) bacteria and collected them on membrane filters. Then we generated air ions by applying a high voltage to a carbon fiber tip and applied them to the contaminated filters. The antibacterial efficiency was not significantly affected by the bacteria being Gram-positive or Gram-negative, however, negative ions showed a lower antibacterial efficiency than positive ions to both E. coli and S. epidermidis, even though the concentration of negative air ions was much higher than that of positive air ions. With a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images and fluorescence microscopy images using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit, electrostatic disruption of the bacteria was found to be the dominant antibacterial effect.
TI  - [Infection in patients with malignant tumors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characters of infection in patients with malignant  tumors, especially the distribution, yearly change of pathogens, and pathogen resistance to common antibacterial agents. METHODS: We respectively analyzed the characters of infection in 489 patients with malignant tumors. RESULTS: The respiratory tract was the most frequent infection site (61.1%). The infection was mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterias mainly consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii (46.3%). The Gram-positive bacteria mainly consisted of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), and the rest 23.8% of the infection was caused by different fungi, mainly consisting of Candida albicans. The ratio of the Gram-negative bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (except ceftazidime), sulfanilamides, tetracyclines and quinolones was higher. The ratio of the Gram-positive bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, macrolides and quinolones was higher. The ratio of fungus resistance to antibacterial agents such as fluconazol and itraconazole was higher. The infection caused by fungi obviously increased in the past 5 years. CONCLUSION: The infection in patients with malignant tumors is mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens, and the pathogen resistance to antibacterial agents is serious. The infection caused by fungi is increasing.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. When administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. Probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. AIMS: To identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (In-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of Lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. To compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in Baghdad during August to November 2009. These swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. Subcultures were performed on selective media. The necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. Susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates Lacto. Acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/mL) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Ninety different organisms were isolated. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). However, the incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic Streptococci was 4(4.4%). In susceptibility testing, Lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. The coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. CONCLUSION: The results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/mL had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. This indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.
TI  - Co(III), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone: Synthesis, characterization, X-ray structures and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The new ligand 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone (HATtsc) and the complexes [Co(ATtsc)(2)](2)[CoCl(4)].2H(2)O (1), [Co(ATtsc)(2)]NO(3).H(2)O (2), [Ni(HATtsc)(2)](NO(3))(2) (3), [ZnCl(2)(HATtsc)].CH(3)CN (4), [{CdCl(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-Cl)(2)].2H(2)O (5) and [{Cd(NO(3))(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-NO(3))(2)] (6) were isolated and characterized by a variety of physico-chemical techniques and X-ray diffraction. The structure of HATtsc in 1 and 2 presented a thiolate form while in 3-6 the thione form was present, as it was in free ligand. In addition, we studied the antibacterial activity of the ligand and complexes 2-6 against some representative bacteria. Cd(II) complexes were more active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis than organic ligand. Conversely, Cd(II) compounds seemed to interfere in the cell separation of B. subtilis.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antibiotic activity of the arylomycin natural products is masked by natural target mutations.
AB  - Novel classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens. The arylomycin class of natural products inhibits a promising antimicrobial target, type I signal peptidase (SPase), but upon initial characterization appeared to lack whole-cell activity against most pathogens. Here, we show that Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is sensitive to the arylomycins, evolves resistance via mutations in SPase and that analogous mutations are responsible for the natural resistance of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We identify diverse bacteria lacking these mutations and demonstrate that most are sensitive to the arylomycins. The results illustrate that the arylomycins have a broad-spectrum of activity and are viable candidates for development into therapeutics. The results also raise the possibility that naturally occurring resistance may have masked other natural product scaffolds that might be developed into therapeutics.
TI  - SWNT-MWNT hybrid filter attains high viral removal and bacterial inactivation.
AB  - We describe the concept and demonstrate the efficacy of a novel SWNT-MWNT hybrid  filter for the removal and inactivation of microbial pathogens from water. The filter is composed of a thin SWNT layer (0.05 mg cm(-2)) on top of a thicker MWNT layer (0.27 mg cm(-2)) supported by a microporous support membrane. The SWNT-MWNT filter exhibits high log removal of several model viruses (MS2, PRD1, and T4 bacteriophages) by depth filtration, which predominantly takes place in the thicker and more uniform MWNT layer. The filter removes all bacteria by a sieving mechanism, with the top SWNT layer providing high levels of inactivation of model bacteria (Escherichia coli K12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis), as well as microbes from river water and treated wastewater effluent. The dual-layer SWNT-MWNT filter lays the framework for new possibilities in point-of-use water filtration.
TI  - Chitosan-vancomysin composite biomaterial as a laser activated surgical adhesive  with regional antimicrobial activity.
AB  - We have used laser irradiation to enhance the natural adhesiveness of chitosan to form a thin film surgical adhesive. Prevention of infection at surgical sites often utilizes systemic provision of antibiotics with reduced local efficacy and potential side effects. In the work reported here, we investigate the bactericidal properties of laser-irradiated chitosan films and their impregnation with the antibiotic vancomycin. Despite strong efficacy in solution, chitosan films showed no antimicrobial activity against representatives of common pathogens Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , and S. epidermidis . In contrast, a composite of chitosan adhesive and the antibiotic vancomycin showed therapeutically significant release profiles greater that the Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs) for the Staphylococci over a 28 day period. These composite films had greater crystallinity, up to 28 +/- 3 compared to 8.9 +/- 2%, for its unblended counterpart. Despite a significant increase in material strength from 31.4 +/- 4 to 77.5 +/- 5 MPa, flexibility was still maintained with an elongation to break around 5 +/- 2% and fold endurance of approximately 30 +/- 3-folds. Laser irradiation had no apparent effect on the release or activity of the antibiotic which survived transient temperatures at the film-tissue interface during infrared irradiation of around 54 degrees C. Furthermore, significant adhesive strength was still apparent, 15.6 +/- 2 KPa. Thus, we have developed a laser-activated bioadhesive with the potential to close wounds while facilitating the prevention of microbial infection through local release of antibiotic targeted to the site of potential infection.
TI  - Bacterial growth kinetics in ACD-A apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  PAS III storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (LR-AP) in a platelet (PLT) additive solution (PAS; InterSol, Fenwal, Inc.) compared to LR-AP stored in plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hyperconcentrated, double-dose LR-AP were collected from healthy donors with a separator (AMICUS, Fenwal, Inc.). LR-AP were evenly divided, InterSol was added to half (65% InterSol:35% plasma [PAS]), and PLTs in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (PL). Bacteria were inoculated into each LR-AP PAS/PL pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. Time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. RESULTS: Streptococcus viridans did not grow to detectable levels in either PAS or PL units. The other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between PL and PAS LR-AP; PL had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and PAS had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: We observed that five index organisms will grow in LR-AP stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma to InterSol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 CFUs/mL. The more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a PAS storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the PAS units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. This may present an early bacterial detection advantage for PAS-stored PLTs.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in adult febrile neutropenic patients: a comparison between two time periods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to study trends in bacterial spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in adult febrile neutropenic patients during two time periods. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 379 adult oncology patients admitted with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia at our institute during years 2003 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 151 organisms were isolated during the two calendar years. Gram negative bacteria accounted for 57.6% of organisms, while gram positive organisms accounted for 42.3% of the total isolates. The most common organisms were: Escherichia coli (23.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). The number of gram positive isolates showed an increase from 35% in 2003 to 47.2% in 2006 (p = 0.13). During each calendar year, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were 100% susceptible to vancomycin and 33% strains of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin resistant. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin during both time periods. Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ciprofloxacin increased from 0% in 2003 to 50% in 2006 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Gram negative organisms are the predominant organisms in adult febrile neutropenic patients at our institute. Initial empirical therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam seems appropriate to cover most gram negative pathogens while vancomycin to be added for suspected gram positive infections. During the two calendar years resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ciprofloxacin has significantly increased.
TI  - Antibacterial action of a heat-stable form of L-amino acid oxidase isolated from  king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom.
AB  - The major l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO, EC 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom LAAO as it possesses unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. The antibacterial effects of king cobra venom LAAO were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. For comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. King cobra venom LAAO was very effective in inhibiting the two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78mug/mL (0.006muM) and 1.56mug/mL (0.012muM) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively. The MICs are comparable to the MICs of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. However, the LAAO was only moderately effective against three Gram-negative bacteria tested (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), with MIC ranges from 25 to 50mug/mL (0.2-0.4muM). Catalase at the concentration of 1mg/mL abolished the antibacterial effect of LAAO, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. Binding studies indicated that king cobra venom LAAO binds strongly to the Gram-positive S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but less strongly to the Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.
TI  - Efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone iodine (PI) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. METHODS: CHG and PI, alone and combined, were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible S aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/mL at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. Fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (FBCIs) were calculated to determine CHG and PI compatibility. Additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with S aureus (MSSA), treated for 2 hours with CHG 3%, PI 5%, or CHG 3% and PI 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. RESULTS: In broth, CHG demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas PI activity was all-or-none. All isolates studied were similarly susceptible to CHG (MBCs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). The MBCs of PI were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. Overall, FBCI calculations showed indifference. Treatment of MSSA-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated that the CHG-PI combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. CONCLUSION: FBCIs, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining CHG and PI had no negative impact on antisepsis. Moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.
TI  - [Infectious complications of reconstructive operations on carotid arteries in atherosclerotic stenoses].
AB  - Analysed herein are the outcomes of a total of 2,240 reconstructive operations on carotid arteries (CA) performed in patients presenting with CA stenosis. Twenty-two (0.98%) patients were found to have developed infectious complications with the involvement of the reconstructed zone. Once suppuration had occurred sixteen patients were subjected to autovenous prosthetic repair of the internal carotid artery (ICA), with a further four cases having endured prosthetic reconstruction with a portion of the external CA, and the remaining two patients sustained ligation of the ICA. In the immediate postoperative period, two deaths had occurred, with recurrent infections accompanied and followed by the development of arrosive haemorrhage observed in two cases. The most commonly encountered microbial agents responsible for suppuration were largely staphylococci and streptococci, as well as Escherichia coli. The preoperative and postoperative prevention with antibiotics is obligatory. In order to assess the condition of the carotid arteries and involvement thereof into the infectious process it is necessary to rely upon the findings of ultrasonographic scanning of soft tissues of the neck in a combination with duplex scanning of carotid arteries. Early aggressive surgical policy consisting in extended surgical debridement of the infectious wound, reconstruction of the CA with autologous tissue aimed at preserving cerebral blood supply, and targeted antibiotic therapy make it possible in the majority of cases to obtain positive therapeutic outcomes.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Fungicidal effect of prenylated flavonol, papyriflavonol A, isolated from Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) vent. against Candida albicans.
AB  - Papyriflavonol A (PapA), a prenylated flavonoid (5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-6,5'-di-(r,r-dimethylallyl)-flavonol), was isolated from the root barks of Broussonetia papyriferra. Our previous study showed that PapA has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. In this study, the mode of action of PapA against Candida albicans was investigated to evaluate PapA as antifungal agent. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were 10~25 microgram/ml for C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The kinetics of cell growth inhibition, scanning electron microscopy, and measurement of plasma membrane florescence anisotrophy revealed that the antifungal activity of PapA against C. albicans and S. cerevisiae is mediated by its ability to disrupt the cell membrane integrity. Compared with amphotericin B, a cell membrane disrupting polyene antibiotic, the hemolytic toxicity of PapA was negligible. At 10~25 microgram/ml of MIC levels for the tested strains, the hemolysis ratio of human erythrocytes was less than 5%. Our results suggest that PapA could be a therapeutic fungicidal agent having a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Efficacy of local rifampin/minocycline delivery (AIGIS(RX)(R)) to eliminate biofilm formation on implanted pacing devices in a rabbit model.
AB  - PURPOSE: Device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. Once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the AIGIS(RX)(R) Anti-Bacterial envelope to reduce the formation of bacterial biofilm on implanted pacing devices. METHODS: An infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without AIGIS(RX)(R) was placed. The incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. After seven days, devices were explanted and assessed for viable bacteria by a sonication/vortex procedure to quantify bacteria, and by imaging of the device surface by scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The presence of the AIGIS(RX)(R) envelope eliminated recoverable, viable bacteria from the explanted devices using a vortex/sonication technique from in vivo models of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, and Escherichia coli infections. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy demonstrate greatly reduced biological material on the pacemaker surfaces in the presence of the AIGIS(RX)(R) envelope compared to untreated controls. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that in this animal model, the AIGIS(RX)(R) device reduces the formation of adherent bacteria and reduces bioburden on implanted, infected pacemaker devices.
TI  - Chitosan films are NOT antimicrobial.
AB  - Chitosan is a promising biomaterial for biomedical applications and is currently  applied as wound dressings. While chitosan solutions demonstrate strong bactericidal activity against a range of medically important bacteria, the study here reports a loss of this beneficial property in thin films cast from the same solutions. Chitosan films (20 microm) showed no inhibitory effects against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis species. In contrast, solutions used to prepare the films showed almost complete inhibition (approximately 98 +/- 2%) when tested on bacterial lawns and in liquid cultures. Increased acidity of the chitosan solutions (pH 5) was shown to promote the bactericidal effects of this biopolymer. The concept that devices fabricated from chitosan have an inherent antimicrobial activity is suggested as an important misconception.
TI  - Characterization of the developed antimicrobial urological catheters.
AB  - Antimicrobial urological catheters were developed by the mixed, covalent and non-covalent binding of sparfloxacin (SPA) to heparin (HP) film which was first deposited on the latex surface of biomaterial. The SPA-HP modified surface was characterized by SEM analysis and ATR-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the antimicrobial prevention, SPA as an antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial spectrum was chosen. Antimicrobial activity of antibiotic-modified catheter against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli strains was assessed using various procedures. On the basis of the inhibition zone and diffusion assays the efficacy around the modified catheters was demonstrated. The test samples clearly showed an antibacterial activity against all tested bacterial stains for a least one month. Inhibition of the bacterial colonization on the modified catheter surface was proved by the biofilm test. Antimicrobial activity of SPA-treated catheter surface was also quantitatively evaluated according to standard method of ISO based on JIS. The R-values were found to be higher than 3.8. The performed research indicated that the immobilization of SPA on the catheter surface by means of the mixed-type bonds resulted in stable antibacterial protection of the urological catheters for a long time.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. As honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. We investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by RS honey, the source for the production of Revamil(R) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). RS honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. It was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of RS honey by enrichment with endogenous compounds, but RS honey enriched with 75 muM of the synthetic peptide Bactericidal Peptide 2 (BP2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including MRSA and ESBL E. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. RS honey enriched with BP2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either BP2 or honey alone.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. In experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees C and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. From the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Staphylococcus aureus species. These 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. All contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. In samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. In experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C. Semen with E. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. This reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). In conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections in HIV-infected adults attending a Lagos teaching hospital.
AB  - An investigation was carried out during October 2005-September 2006 to determine  the prevalence of bloodstream infections in patients attending the outpatient department of the HIV/AIDS clinic at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. Two hundred and one patients--86 males and 115 females--aged 14-65 years were recruited for the study. Serological diagnosis was carried out on them to confirm their HIV status. Their CD4 counts were done using the micromagnetic bead method. Twenty mL of venous blood sample collected from each patient was inoculated into a pair of Oxoid Signal blood culture bottles for 2-14 days. Thereafter, 0.1 mL of the sample was plated in duplicates on MacConkey, blood and chocolate agar media and incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24 hours. The CD4+ counts were generally low as 67% of 140 patients sampled had < 200 cells/microL of blood. Twenty-six bacterial isolates were obtained from the blood samples and comprised 15 (58%) coagulase-negative staphylococci as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (7), S. cohnii cohnii (1), S. cohnii urealyticum (2), S. chromogenes (1), S. warneri (2), S. scuri (1), and S. xylosus (1). Others were 6 (23%) Gram-negative non-typhoid Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium (4), S. Enteritidis (2); Pseudomonas fluorescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Ochrobactrum anthropi (1), Moraxella sp. (1), and Chryseobacterium meningosepticum. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that coagulase-negative staphylococci had good sensitivities to vancomycin and most other antibiotics screened but were resistant mainly to ampicilin and tetracycline. The Gram-negative organisms isolated also showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and septrin. This study demonstrates that coagulase-negative staphylococci and non-typhoidal Salmonellae are the most common aetiological agents of bacteraemia among HIV-infected adults attending the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. The organisms were resistant to older-generation antibiotics often prescribed in this environment but were sensitive to vancomycin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, and other new-generation antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in Mumbai, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of food-borne illnesses in India is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. Monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they enter the food chain. METHODOLOGY: Microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at Deonar Abattoir, Mumbai. Swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for Staphylococcus spp., Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Average Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. The Escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the Klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 CFU/cm(2). Counts for Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 CFU/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. S. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by K. aerogenes (31.9%), B. subtilis (28.2%) and P. vulgaris (23.6%). Salmonella spp. were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary Indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. Appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in Indian meat production facilities.
TI  - Role of surface protein SasG in biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The SasG surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to promote the formation of biofilm. SasG comprises an N-terminal A domain and repeated B domains. Here we demonstrate that SasG is involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm, a process that requires a physiological concentration of Zn(2+). The B domains, but not the A domain, are required. Purified recombinant B domain protein can form dimers in vitro in a Zn(2+)-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the protein can bind to cells that have B domains anchored to their surface and block biofilm formation. The full-length SasG protein exposed on the cell surface is processed within the B domains to a limited degree, resulting in cleaved proteins of various lengths being released into the supernatant. Some of the released molecules associate with the surface-exposed B domains that remain attached to the cell. Studies using inhibitors and mutants failed to identify any protease that could cause the observed cleavage within the B domains. Extensively purified recombinant B domain protein is very labile, and we propose that cleavage occurs spontaneously at labile peptide bonds and that this is necessary for biofilm formation.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives.
AB  - 3D QSAR analysis for the 21 molecules of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles was carried out by using k-Nearest Neighbor Molecular Field Analysis (kNN-MFA) combined with various selection procedures. 30 3D QSAR models were generated; one of these models was selected on the basis of q(2) and pred_r(2) values. The selected Model has training set of 17 molecules and test set of 4 molecules with validation (q(2)) and cross validation (pred_r(2)) values of 0.6969 and 0.6148 respectively. Title compounds of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized by the ring closure reactions of various acylhydrazides with carbon disulphide (4a-e) and with aromatic acids in POCl(3) (5a-e). After structural elucidation, all the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Examination of the antimicrobial activity of some G. Begonia L. species as a possible piece of phytodesign].
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of volatile emanations of intact g. Begonia plants in air-tight chambers and ordinary rooms were studied. The plants were effective against microbial test-objects Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and yeast like fungi.
TI  - Cajanol inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by acting on membrane and DNA damage.
AB  - In the present study, the mechanism of antibacterial activity of cajanol extracted from the roots of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was investigated. The antibacterial activity of cajanol was evaluated towards six bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the broth microdilution method. It showed strong antibacterial activity towards all bacteria tested with minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values ranging from 98.90 microM to 197.8 microM. Cajanol-induced death rates in the most sensitive strains ( E.COLI, 96.55 % and S. AUREUS, 97.25 %) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the activity of cajanol on the membranes of E. coli and S. aureus was investigated by using lecithin, phosphate groups, and fluorescence microscopy. Cajanol-induced DNA damage was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In summary, cajanol inhibited E. coli only by DNA damage, whereas S. aureus was inhibited by affecting both, the lecithin and phosphate groups on the cellular membrane and DNA. The present study shows that cajanol possesses antibacterial activity in vitro towards both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and therefore may be a promising candidate as an antibacterial agent for the therapy of microbial infections.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - Obstacles of Multiplex Real-Time PCR for Bacterial 16S rDNA: Primer Specifity and DNA Decontamination of Taq Polymerase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of a broad range of bacteria by PCR is applied for the  screening of blood and blood products with special attention to platelet concentrates. For practical use it is desirable that detection systems include Gram-positive, Gram-negative and non-Gram-stainable bacteria. It is quite challenging to achieve high sensitivity along with a clear negative control with PCR reagents, because especially Taq polymerase is contaminated with traces of bacterial DNA. METHODS: Bacterial DNA decontamination of Taq polymerase was attempted by two different methods using the restriction enzyme Sau 3A1 and microfiltration. Additionally a commercially available Taq polymerase depleted of bacterial DNA was included. A published real-time PCR specific for Gram-negative bacteria was adapted for Gram-positive bacteria, including certain Staphylococcus species and Mycobacteria, and was used to charge the three Taq polymer-ases depleted of bacterial DNA contamination RESULTS: Despite published reports about successful DNA decontamination, all three approaches performed poorly in experiments done in this study. Sensitivity ranged at approximately 50-100 colony forming units (CFU) per PCR reaction for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis, corresponding to 1,250-2,500 CFU/ml sample material. Conclusion: It seems unsatisfying to accept detection limits that high for diagnostic bacterial PCR even if highly multiplexed. Reliable methods for DNA decontamination of Taq polymerase are needed and would present one important step towards bacterial DNA detection with high sensitivity.
TI  - Towards long-lasting antibacterial stainless steel surfaces by combining double glow plasma silvering with active screen plasma nitriding.
AB  - Antibacterial surface modification of biomedical materials has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing bacterial proliferation on the surfaces of devices. However, thin antibacterial coatings or modified layers can be easily worn down when interacting with other surfaces in relative motion, thus leading to a low durability of the antibacterial surface. To this end, novel biomaterial surfaces with antibacterial Ag agents and a wear-resistant S-phase have been generated on stainless steel by duplex plasma silvering-nitriding techniques for application to load-bearing medical devices. The chemical composition, microstructure, surface topography, roughness and wettability of SS surfaces were characterised using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy/wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS), X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and a contact angle goniometer. Optimal surface design for high antimicrobial activity and prolonged durability has been achieved, as evidenced by rapid bacterial killing rates (within 6h), an ultra hard matrix (875 +/- 25 Hv), high load-bearing capacity (critical load 37 N) and excellent wear resistance (wear rate 4.9 x 10(-)(6) mm(3) m(-)(1)). Ag embedded in the hard substrate of fcc compounds M(4)N (M=Fe, Cr, Ag, etc.) and the expanded fcc nitrogen S-phase shows deep infiltration of 6 +/- 1 mum, and provides bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 11047 of over 97% and 90%, respectively, within 6h. The presence of silver in the surface before and after scratching under a progressive load applied up to 60 N using a diamond stylus was confirmed by WDS.
TI  - [Changes of pathogens for nosocomial infection of patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - In order to investigate the distribution of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological diseases in our hospital, and to explore the changes of the pathogens isolated. The method of retrospective investigation and analysis was employed. 1164 strain pathogens were isolated from the patients with hematological diseases during the period of 1997-2009. The results showed that the Gram-positive cocci infection increased gradually during the 13 years, but has been stable in the last 4 years. The Gram-negative bacteria showed a trend decrease. The fungi increased during these years. The rates of infection with gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacteria and fungus were 28.2%, 59.8% and 12.0% respectively. For the details, Escherichia coli infection rate was the highest: 12.1%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.1%), Enterobacter (8.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.3%) and Enterococci (6.6%). The distribution of G(+)- and G(-) pathogens showed obvious change on end of 1990's and beginning of this century, but it was tending towards stability on recent years; the incidence of fungus was tending towards increase, which was related to wide application of strong broad-spectrum antibiotics. In conclusion, the patients with hematological diseases, as the high-risk group of nosocomial infection, should be monitored strictly. Infection is related to many factors, and the main factor is dysfunction of autoimmunity. The strategies should be explored to strengthen the immune protection and set up a reasonable scheme of antibiotics.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Detection and gram discrimination of bacterial pathogens from aqueous and vitreous humor using real-time PCR assays.
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and apply real-time PCR protocols to the detection and classification of the Gram status of bacterial pathogens in aqueous and vitreous humor collected from clinically suspected intraocular infections. METHODS: The analytical specificity of two PCR assays, SYBR Green 16S rDNA-Based Universal PCR (SGRU-PCR), and a Multiplex Gram-Specific TaqMan-Based PCR (MGST-PCR), was determined with 31 clinically important pathogens, including 20 Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative. Analytical sensitivity was determined with a 10-fold dilution of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli DNA. Assays were further tested on aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous humor (n = 11) samples collected from patients with clinically diagnosed intraocular infections. RESULTS: DNA was amplified from all control bacterial isolates when using SGRU-PCR. MGST-PCR correctly classified the Gram status of all these isolates. The SGRU-PCR limit of detection of S. epidermidis and E. coli DNA was 100 fg/muL (E = 0.82 and 0.86; r(2) = 0.99) and for MGST-PCR, 1 pg/muL (E = 0.66 and 0.70; r(2) = 0.99. For clinical intraocular samples, positivity of culture was 47.6% and for real-time PCR assays, 95.2%. Gram classification was achieved in 100% of MGST-PCR-positive samples. Among microbiologically negative samples, real-time PCR assays were positive in 90% of cases. The false-positive rate in control aqueous was 3.2%, and control samples of vitreous were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR assays demonstrated good correlation, with culture-proven RESULTS: With the use of these methods, bacterial detection was improved from 47.6% to 95.3%, demonstrating them to be sensitive, rapid tests for diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial biomaterials based on carbon nanotubes dispersed in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid).
AB  - Biomaterials that inactivate microbes are needed to eliminate medical device infections. We investigate here the antimicrobial nature of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) incorporated within the biomedical polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). We find Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis viability and metabolic activity to be significantly diminished in the presence of SWNT-PLGA, and to correlate with SWNT length and concentration (<2% by weight). Up to 98% of bacteria die within one hour on SWNT-PLGA versus 15-20% on pure PLGA. Shorter SWNTs are more toxic, possibly due to increased density of open tube ends. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of SWNT-PLGA as an antimicrobial biomaterial.
TI  - Diamagnetic levitation enhances growth of liquid bacterial cultures by increasing oxygen availability.
AB  - Diamagnetic levitation is a technique that uses a strong, spatially varying magnetic field to reproduce aspects of weightlessness, on the Earth. We used a superconducting magnet to levitate growing bacterial cultures for up to 18 h, to determine the effect of diamagnetic levitation on all phases of the bacterial growth cycle. We find that diamagnetic levitation increases the rate of population growth in a liquid culture and reduces the sedimentation rate of the cells. Further experiments and microarray gene analysis show that the increase in growth rate is owing to enhanced oxygen availability. We also demonstrate that the magnetic field that levitates the cells also induces convective stirring in the liquid. We present a simple theoretical model, showing how the paramagnetic force on dissolved oxygen can cause convection during the aerobic phases of bacterial growth. We propose that this convection enhances oxygen availability by transporting oxygen around the liquid culture. Since this process results from the strong magnetic field, it is not present in other weightless environments, e.g. in Earth orbit. Hence, these results are of significance and timely to researchers considering the use of diamagnetic levitation to explore effects of weightlessness on living organisms and on physical phenomena.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Novel, UV-curable coatings containing a tethered biocide: Synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Cationic, UV -curable coatings containing the tethered biocide, triclosan, were produced and their antimicrobial activity toward Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli determined. Two polysiloxanes functionalized with both cycloaliphatic epoxy and triclosan were synthesized using hydrosilylation. The functionalized polysiloxanes, with varied concentration of pendant triclosan, were used to produce UV-curable coatings with reasonably good coating properties. Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopy showed that the tethered triclosan moieties self-concentrate on the coating surface. Using biological assays, it was determined that the coatings possessed nearly 100% antimicrobial activity toward the Gram-positive bacterium, S. epidermidis, without leaching toxic components. For the Gram-negative bacterium, E. coli, 60-80% reduction in biofilm retention was observed for all the coatings. Interestingly, the coatings were lesser effective in reducing E. coli cell viability suggesting that the tethered triclosan were able to substantially reduce the production of the biofilm extracellular matrix with minimal adverse affect on the bacterial cells attached to the coating surfaces. The high specificity of the coatings toward S. epidermidis indicates that a novel mode of contact-active antimicrobial activity was achieved through the disruption of processes unique to the Gram-positive cell wall. These novel UV-curable coatings have potential applications in inhibiting implantable biomedical device associated infections.
TI  - Microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - The tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to define the limit of detection (LOD), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. METHODS: A PCR algorithm consisting of initial broad-based detection of Eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or Gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. The 16S rRNA gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. Pathogen-specific probes were designed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. The LOD and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. A total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clinical samples obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. RESULTS: The LOD of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. Time to detection was 3 hours. In clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or Gram-typing probes. Adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% CI = 65.3% to 98.6%). The universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A broad-based multiprobe PCR assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. Findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of crude epicarp and seed extracts from mature avocado fruit (Persea americana) of three cultivars.
AB  - The epicarp and seed of Persea Americana Mill. var. Hass (Lauraceae), Persea Americana Mill. var. Shepard, and Persea americana Mill. var Fuerte cultivars of mature avocados (n = 3) were ground separately and extracted with both absolute ethanol and distilled water. Extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity using the microtiter broth microdilution assay against four Gram-positive bacteria, six Gram-negative bacteria, and one yeast. Antimicrobial activity against two molds was determined by the hole plate method. The ethanol extracts showed antimicrobial activity (104.2-416.7 microg/mL) toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (except Escherichia coli), while inhibition of the water extracts was only observed for Listeria monocytogenes (93.8-375.0 microg/mL) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (354.2 microg/mL). The minimum concentration required to inhibit Zygosaccharomyces bailii was 500 microg/mL for the ethanol extracts, while no inhibition was observed for the water extracts. No inhibition by either ethanol or water extracts was observed against Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus flavus.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy by liposome-encapsulated water-soluble photosensitizers.
AB  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is an alternative method for killing bacterial cells in view of the increasing problem of multi-antibiotic resistance. We examined the effect of three water-soluble photosensitizers (PhS): methylene blue (MB), neutral red (NR) and rose bengal (RB) on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We compared the efficacy of PhS in their free form and encapsulated in liposomal formulations against various bacterial strains, and determined conditions for the effective use of encapsulated PhS. We found that all three PhS were able to eradicate the Gram-positive microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Sarcina lutea; and MB and RB were effective against St. epidermidis. In the case of the Gram-negative species, MB and RB were cytotoxic against the Shigella flexneri, NR-inactivated Escherichia coli and Salmonella para B, and BR was effective in killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the examined PhS showed activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. MB and NR enclosed in liposomes gave a stronger antimicrobial effect than free PhS for all tested prokaryotes, whereas encapsulation of RB led to no increase in its activity. We suggest that encapsulation of PhS can increase the photoinactivation of bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in central part of Croatia.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of thymol and carvacrol derivatives.
AB  - Fourteen esters of thymol and carvacrol were synthesized and characterized on the basis of spectral data. The NMR data for some of these are being given for the first time. The antibacterial activity screening of thymol, carvacrol and their esters were carried out against four Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121, Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC 435) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli MTCC 723) bacteria. The enhancement in activity was noticed in the thymyl ester derivatives 4a-c (against S. mutans, B. subtilis and S. epidermidis) in comparison to thymol, whereas the carvacrol derivatives were found to be much less active than carvacrol.
TI  - Preparation and in-vitro Antibacterial Evaluation of Electroless Silver Coated Polymers.
AB  - Long-term use of indwelling medical catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated nosocomial infections. In this study the effectiveness of silver coating of polystyrene and polyethylene polymers was investigated. Polymer pieces of 2 cm(2) each were coated with a thin layer of silver using electroless plating technique. Silver-coated polymers were challenged with cultures of four different microorganisms known for their involvement in nosocomial infections in both solid and broth media. The tested bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Silver release from the coated polymers was 2-5 mug/cm(2) which was confirmed by chemical and biological methods. The silver coating thickness ranged between 20-450 nm. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were the most adherent bacteria to polystyrene sheets while E. coli showed minimum adherence effect. The survival rate of different bacteria after 80 min in a time course experiment tended to dominate E. coli as the most sensitive bacteria to the effect of silver with zero survival rate while around 4% of P. aeruginosa were detected after same period. Silver coating of indwelling polymers by electroless technique seems promising in combating nosocomial infections due to long-term catheterization.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Origin of the putrescine-producing ability of the coagulase-negative bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis 2015B.
AB  - A multiplex PCR method, aimed at the detection of genes associated with biogenic  amine production, identified the odc gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase in 1 of 15 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ability of the positive strain, S. epidermidis 2015B, to produce putrescine in vitro was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this strain, the odc gene was detected on plasmid DNA, suggesting that the ability to form putrescine is carried by a mobile element, which explains the fact that the trait is strain dependent within the S. epidermidis species. A 6,292-bp nucleotide sequence harboring the putative odc gene was determined. S. epidermidis ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) showed 60 to 65% sequence identity with known ODCs of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Downstream of the odc gene, a gene encoding a putative amino acid transporter was found that shared 59% sequence identity with the ornithine/putrescine exchanger (PotE) of Escherichia coli. Cloning and expression of the potE gene of S. epidermis 2015B in Lactococcus lactis demonstrated that the gene product transported ornithine and putrescine into the cells and efficiently exchanged putrescine for ornithine. Analysis of the flanking regions showed high identity levels with different S. epidermidis plasmid sequences, which would confirm the plasmidic location of the odc operon. It follows that the odc and potE gene pair encodes a putrescine-producing pathway in S. epidermis 2015B that was acquired through horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Chemical composition of the SFE-CO extracts from Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth and their antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of SFE-CO(2)(supercritical fluid extraction) extracts and ethanol extracts from Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth were investigated. The flavonoid compounds orientin, vitexin, isovitexin, pinostrobin and the stilbene cajaninstilbene acid were detected in SFE-CO(2) extracts by HPLC-DAD. In vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were evaluated against eight microbial strains (the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli; and the fungi Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). A marked inhibitory effect of the SFE extracts was observed against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The IC(50) of SFE-CO(2) extracts ranged from 0.0557 mg/ml to 0.0689 mg/ml consisting of cancer (MCF-7 (0.0557 mg/ml)) as well as non-cancer (BHK-21 (0.0641 mg/ml), RAW264.7 (0.0689 mg/ml) and Vero (0.0625 mg/ml)) cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze death rate of the most sensitive strain (Staphylococcus aureus) caused by the SFE extracts. Additionally, the whole cell proteins of Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect if there were changes in protein patterns. In vivo antimicrobial activity was studies in mice that had been inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. The potential mechanism of antimicrobial activity in vivo was studied by histopathology.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - In vitro assessment of antimicrobial properties of rifampin-coated Titan((R)) Coloplast penile implants and comparison with Inhibizone((R)).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is a common practice to soak Titan((R)) Coloplast penile implants in antibiotic solution prior to implantation. Aim. The aim of this study is to identify an ideal solution for soaking the Titan((R)) Coloplast penile implants prior to implantation. METHODS: Titan((R)) strips were soaked in a different combination of antibiotics and the zone of inhibition was studied against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. This zone of inhibition was compared against zone of inhibition produced by Inhibizone((R)) -coated silicone strips. Zones of inhibitions were also compared for different components of Inhibizone((R)) implant such as cylinder, tubing, connector, rear tip extender, and reservoir, and compared with similar components of Titan((R)) Coloplast penile implants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The zone of inhibition against S. epidermidis and E. coli for Titan strips dipped in Rifampin and Gentamicin was compared against other antibiotics. The clinical significance of dipping Titan((R)) -coated Coloplast implant in Rifampin and Gentamicin solution was determined. RESULTS: Rifampin 10mg/mL+gentamicin 1mg/mL (R10/G1) and rifampin 1mg/mL+gentamicin 1mg/mL (R1/G1) had excellent coverage against S. epidermidis and E. coli. The zone of inhibition (utilizing the Titan((R)) coating) produced by both these solutions exceeds that produced by Inhibizone((R)) by 40% to 56% for S. epidermidis and 33% for E. coli. Components of the American Medical System implant (tubing connectors and rear tip extenders) are not coated with antibiotics and had no zone of inhibition. CONCLUSION: Soaking Titan((R)) -coated Coloplast implants in R10/G1 solution produces a zone of inhibition greater than that produced by Inhibizone((R)) -coated penile implants. The clinical significance of this increased zone of inhibition can only be determined by a separate clinical study.
TI  - Absence of bacterial resistance to medical-grade manuka honey.
AB  - Clinical use of honey in the topical treatment of wounds has increased in Europe  and North America since licensed wound care products became available in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Honey-resistant bacteria have not been isolated from wounds, but there is a need to investigate whether honey has the potential to select for honey resistance. Two cultures of bacteria from reference collections (Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10017 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and four cultures isolated from wounds (Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. epidermidis) were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of manuka honey in continuous and stepwise training experiments to determine whether the susceptibility to honey diminished. Reduced susceptibilities to manuka honey in the test organisms during long-term stepwise resistance training were found, but these changes were not permanent and honey-resistant mutants were not detected. The risk of bacteria acquiring resistance to honey will be low if high concentrations are maintained clinically.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2008].
AB  - We examined the antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against main bacteria isolated from patient blood in Keio university hospital between January and November in 2008. A total of 187 isolates, including 43 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 50 Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested. Meropenem showed the potent and stable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially compared with our previous testing data. These results suggested that meropenem was first-line antibiotic for serious infections, although over 12 years passed after meropenem was approved in Japan.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. Corticosteroid formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. The hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. Clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on C. albicans. In contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. Fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against S. pyogenes and no activity against C. albicans or E. coli. In summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. In limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. With the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.
TI  - Integrated antimicrobial and nonfouling hydrogels to inhibit the growth of planktonic bacterial cells and keep the surface clean.
AB  - A new strategy integrating antimicrobial and nonfouling/biocompatible properties  is presented. A mild antimicrobial agent (salicylate) was incorporated into a carboxybetaine ester hydrogel, poly(N,N-dimethyl-N-(ethylcarbonylmethyl)-N-[2-(methacryloyloxy)-ethyl]ammonium salicylate) (pCBMA-1 C2 SA) hydrogel, as its anionic counterion. This new hydrogel provides a sustained release of antimicrobial agents to inhibit the growth of planktonic bacteria and create a nonfouling surface to prevent protein adsorption or bacterial accumulation upon the hydrolysis of carboxybetaine esters into zwitterionic groups. The pCBMA-1 C2 SA hydrogel inhibited the growth of both gram-negative Escherichia coli K12 and gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis by 99.9%. This hydrogel holds great potential in applications such as wound dressing and surface coatings for medical devices.
TI  - A simple method to reduce infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  - OBJECT: Postoperative shunt infection is the most common and feared complication  of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement for treatment of hydrocephalus. The rate of shunt infection is highest in the 1st postoperative month. The most common organisms responsible for shunt infection include coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. This suggests a transfer of patient's skin flora via the surgeons' glove as a possible means of infection. The authors conducted a study to determine if the rate of postoperative shunt infections could be reduced simply by changing gloves before handling the shunt catheter. METHODS: A total of 111 neonates born with congenital hydrocephalus requiring a VP shunt were enrolled retrospectively and divided into 2 groups: a control group of 54 neonates treated with standard protocol VP shunt placement (Group A) and a treatment group of 57 neonates in whom, after initially double gloving, the outer pair of gloves was removed before handling the shunt catheter (Group B). Shunt infection rates were compared up to 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction of infection rate from 16.33% in Group A (control) to 3.77% in Group B (p = 0.0458). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that a changing of gloves before handling the shunt catheter may be a simple and cost-effective way to reduce the burden of postoperative shunt infections.
TI  - Patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by organ failure show highly aberrant monocyte signaling profiles assessed by phospho-specific flow cytometry.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To outline signaling profiles and transmigration capacity of monocytes of patients with severe acute pancreatitis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospital intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with severe acute pancreatitis. All patients had organ dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome in 12, renal dysfunction in eight). Healthy volunteers served as reference subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were collected after admission to the intensive care unit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB and p38, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) 1, 3, 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in appropriately stimulated and nonstimulated samples were studied using phospho-specific whole-blood flow cytometry. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1-induced transmigration of monocytes among mononuclear cells obtained by density gradient centrifugation was studied using Transwell cell culture inserts covered with confluent layer of endothelial EA-HY cells. Phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor-kappaB induced by tumor necrosis factor, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, muramyl dipeptide, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were significantly lower in patients' monocytes than monocytes of healthy reference subjects, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 phosphorylation levels were normal. Phosphorylation levels induced by interleukin-6 in STAT1 and STAT3 and by combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187 in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, members of a mitogen-activated protein kinase family, were depressed in patients' monocytes, whereas phosphorylation levels induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in STAT5 was normal. In nonstimulated samples, phosphorylation levels were normal. The transmigration percentage of patients' monocytes was significantly lower than that of reference monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: In severe acute pancreatitis, monocytes show impaired nuclear factor kappaB and STAT1 activation, which may increase susceptibility to secondary infections. p38 activation is normal and STAT3 activation is depressed, which may contribute to maintenance of systemic inflammation. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation is impaired, which may depress monocytes' transmigration and may consequently increase risk of infection. Monitoring of monocyte signaling profiles may aid in finding new therapeutic approaches and predictors of outcome of severe acute pancreatitis.
TI  - Isolation, Characterization and Biological evaluation of secondary metabolite from Aspergillus funiculosus.
AB  - Screening of Aspergillus funiculosus for bioactive secondary metabolites produced kojic acid, which is know to have wide range of biological properties. It is very active against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, but moderately active against yeasts and Gram-positive bacteria except Staphylococcus epidermidis. Filamentous Fungi are more sensitive to kojic acid. When it exposed to larvicidal activity on Aedes aegypti third instar larvae are more sensitive than early fourth instar larvae.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Alkaloids from the bark of Guatteria hispida and their evaluation as antioxidant  and antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of the bark of Guatteria hispida afforded three new alkaloids, 9-methoxy-O-methylmoschatoline (1), 9-methoxyisomoschatoline (2), and isocerasonine (3), along with 10 known alkaloids, 8-oxopseudopalmatine (4), O-methylmoschatoline (5), lysicamine (6), liriodenine (7), 10-methoxyliriodenine (8), nornuciferine (9), anonaine (10), xylopine (11), coreximine (12), and isocoreximine (13). The major compounds, 2, 6, 12, and 13, showed significant antioxidant capacity in the ORAC(FL) assay. Compounds 5, 6, and 7 were active against S. epidermidis and C. dubliniensis, with MIC values in the range 12.5-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial studies of 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-arylsulfanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4] triazolo-3-ones and their corresponding sulfones.
AB  - In the present investigation, a series of novel 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-arylsulfanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4] triazolo-3-ones and their corresponding sulfones were prepared with the objective of developing better antimicrobial agents. The chemical structures of the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral (IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and LCMS) methods. The newly synthesized compounds (4a-i) and (5a-e, 5h) were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antifungal activity was tested against Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among all the compounds synthesized, compounds 4d and 5b exhibited significant antibacterial activity.
TI  - Atomic force microscopy investigation of the characteristic effects of silver ions on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The influence of silver ions on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis has been investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both single cell and cell communities were visualized, and the nanoscale ultrastructure images of these two bacteria strains before and after stimulation of silver ions were obtained. The results showed that in the case of E. coli after treatment with silver ions, vesicles appeared on the cell walls, and the size of vesicles became larger with the increase of the incubation time. However, in the case of S. epidermidis after treatment with silver ions, irregular and deep grooves appeared on the cell walls, and the cytoplasm membrane shrank and became separated from the cell wall. The significant differences in cell wall changes between E. coli and S. epidermidis after treatment with silver ions were related to their structural characters. According to those results, it is shown that AFM can provide new insight into the antimicrobial mechanism of silver ions, and show a new methodological approach to understand the relationship between structure and function of microbial cell when it was exposed to external stimulation.
TI  - Functional heterogeneity and differential priming of circulating neutrophils in human experimental endotoxemia.
AB  - Neutrophils play an important role in host defense. However, deregulation of neutrophils contributes to tissue damage in severe systemic inflammation. In contrast to complications mediated by an overactive neutrophil compartment, severe systemic inflammation is a risk factor for development of immune suppression and as a result, infectious complications. The role of neutrophils in this clinical paradox is poorly understood, and in this study, we tested whether this paradox could be explained by distinct neutrophil subsets and their functionality. We studied the circulating neutrophil compartment immediately after induction of systemic inflammation by administering 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli LPS i.v. to healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were phenotyped by expression of membrane receptors visualized by flow cytometry, capacity to interact with fluorescently labeled microbes, and activation of the NADPH-oxidase by oxidation of Amplex Red and dihydrorhodamine. After induction of systemic inflammation, expression of membrane receptors on neutrophils, such as CXCR1 and -2 (IL-8Rs), C5aR, FcgammaRII, and TLR4, was decreased. Neutrophils were also refractory to fMLF-induced up-regulation of membrane receptors, and suppression of antimicrobial function was shown by decreased interaction with Staphylococcus epidermis. Simultaneously, activation of circulating neutrophils was demonstrated by a threefold increase in release of ROS. The paradoxical phenotype can be explained by the selective priming of the respiratory burst. In contrast, newly released, CD16(dim) banded neutrophils display decreased antimicrobial function. We conclude that systemic inflammation leads to a functionally heterogeneous neutrophil compartment, in which newly released refractory neutrophils can cause susceptibility to infections, and activated, differentiated neutrophils can mediate tissue damage.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - [Analysis and clinical implication of upper urinary tract stone's bacterial spectrum].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the pathogenic bacterial's distribution and the drug resistance in the upper urinary tract stones, and to provide the information for choosing suitable antibiotics. METHODS: Stone samples were taken for culture and for drug sensitivity test in 146 patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy between April 2007 and October 2008, and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Pathogens presented in 72 (49.3%) patients. There were 70 (86.4%) Gram-negative bacteria strains. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae were the predominant bacteria, accounted for 30.9%(25 strains), 23.5% (19 strains) and 12.3% (10 strains), respectively. There were 10 (12.3%) Gram-positive bacteria strains, the predominant bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis (6 strains), accounting for 7.4%. And there was 1 fungi strain (1.2%). Resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (88.7%), ceftriaxone (81.3%) and ciprofloxacin (67.5%) was most commonly found in pathogen, and the rate of resistance to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were 8.6%, 10.0%, 10.0%, respectively. Erythromycylamine, teicoplanin, SMZ-TMP, nitrofurantoin were sensitive to Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial's distribution of upper urinary tract stones are multiple, and the majority pathogen is Gram-negative bacteria. A big variant resistance is found among different bacterium. The suitable antibiotics should be chosen according to the different bacterium in the patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Time-kill assay results for a linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser for lid hygiene.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill testing was performed for a linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pityrosporum ovale to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: An inoculum of 1 mL of each test organism culture was added to 49 mL of test cleanser. At 30 seconds and 1 minute, 1 mL of sample was removed from each test mixture and added to 9 mL of neutralizer. Five milliliters of aliquots were incubated for 48 hours and counted for colony-forming units. Ten percent povidone-iodine was used as a control. RESULTS: At 30 seconds, the linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser produced a 99.9999% reduction in P. aeruginosa, a 99.999% reduction in E. coli, a 99.99% reduction in M. catarrhalis and S. marcescens, a 99.9% reduction in MRSA, a 99.2% reduction in S. epidermidis, and a 97.5% reduction in S. aureus. At 1 minute, this cleanser achieved a 95.8% reduction in P. ovale. At 30 seconds, povidone-iodine produced a 99.9999% reduction in P. aeruginosa and M. catarrhalis, a 99.999% reduction in S. marcescens and a 94.9% reduction in S. epidermidis. At 1 minute, 10% povidone-iodine produced a 93.8% reduction in E coli but failed to produce a 1-log reduction in S. aureus or MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: This linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser may be helpful in the outpatient setting for patients with presurgical, blepharitis, punctal plug and dry eye, and in the inpatient setting for patients who are allergic to iodine, or as an adjunct to povidone-iodine.
TI  - New 6-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines and [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]  [1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-ones: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity evaluation.
AB  - (4-X-Phenylsulfonyl)phenyl] containing 6-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines and [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-ones were synthesized by intermolecular condensation of 2-chloro-N-phenylacetamide, 2-chloroacetic acid, oxalylchloride and bromo-diethylmalonate with 4-amino-5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiols (X = H, Cl, Br). The structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analysis and IR, NMR spectral data. All the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities. Some of them exhibited good activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922.
TI  - Ironing out the wrinkles in the rare biosphere through improved OTU clustering.
AB  - Deep sequencing of PCR amplicon libraries facilitates the detection of low-abundance populations in environmental DNA surveys of complex microbial communities. At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted OTUs and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected OTUs in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the OTU richness in environmental samples by as much as 30-60% but does not reduce the fraction of OTUs in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance patterns in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria causing septicemia in newborns in Leon, Nicaragua: correlation with environmental samples.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the bacteria causing neonatal septicemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Leon, Nicaragua and its relation with bacteria isolated from the environment at the NICU. Our data showed that 74% (34/46) of the bacteria related to newborns with septicemia were Gram-negative and highly resistant to beta-lactams (>85%) and aminoglycosides (80%), leading to treatment failure in 10 neonates with fatal outcome. Although, the prevalence of Gram-positive bacteria (26%) was lower than Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was related to the death of three newborns. No clonal similarity was found among Enterobacter cloacae , Escherichia coli and Serratia liquefaciens isolated from the neonates with septicemia and the NICU environment. However, in order to improve the outcome for neonates with septicemia, infection control practices and appropriate empirical therapy should be considered to reduce the high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria isolated from neonates with septicemia (80%) and from the NICU environment (34%).
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Tunable bioadhesive copolymer hydrogels of thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) containing zwitterionic polysulfobetaine.
AB  - This work describes a novel tunable bioadhesive hydrogel of thermoresponsive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) containing zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA). This novel hydrogel highly regulates general bioadhesive foulants through the adsorption of plasma proteins, the adhesion of human platelets and cells, and the attachment of bacteria. In this investigation, nonionic hydrogels of polyNIPAAm, zwitterionic hydrogels of polySBMA, and three copolymeric hydrogels of NIPAAm and SBMA (poly(NIPAAm-co-SBMA)) were prepared. The copolymeric hydrogels exhibited controllable temperature-dependent swelling behaviors and showed stimuli-responsive phase characteristics in the presence of salts. The interactions of these hydrogels with biomolecules and microorganisms were demonstrated by protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment, which allowed us to evaluate their bioadhesive properties. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies was used to measure different plasma protein adsorptions on the prepared hydrogel surfaces. At a physiological temperature, the high content of the nonionic polyNIPAAm in poly(NIPAAm-co-SBMA) hydrogel exhibits a high protein adsorption due to the interfacial exposure of polyNIPAAm-rich hydrophobic domains. A relatively high content of polySBMA in poly(NIPAAm-co-SBMA) hydrogel exhibits reduced amounts of protein adsorption due to the interfacial hydration of polySBMA-rich hydrophilic segments. The attachment of platelets and the spreading of cells were only observed on polyNIPAAm-rich hydrogel surfaces. Interestingly, the incorporation of zwitterionic SBMA units into the polyNIPAAm gels was found to accelerate the hydration of the cell-cultured surfaces and resulted in more rapid cell detachment. Such copolymer gel surface was shown to be potentially useful for triggered cell detachment. In addition, the interactions of hydrogels with bacteria were also evaluated. The polySBMA-rich hydrogels exhibited evident antimicrobial properties when they were incubated with Gram-positive bacteria ( S. epidermidis ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( E. coli ). This work shows that the bioadhesive properties of poly(NIPAAm-co-SBMA) hydrogels can be effectively controlled via regulated nonionic and zwitterionic molar mass ratios. The tunable-bioadhesive behavior of temperature-sensitive poly(NIPAAm-co-SBMA) makes this biocompatible hydrogel appropriate for biomedical applications.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of compounds from the isodon species].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of ten compounds from Isodon species against five strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus mutans, and Helicobacter pylori. The compounds with the MIC values of 25 microg/ml were isodocarpin against Sta. epidermidis, Str. mutans, and H. pylori, nodosin against Sta. epidermidis and Str. mutans, oridonin against Ser. marcescens, and pedalitin against H. pylori.
TI  - Chain length dependence of antimicrobial peptide-fatty acid conjugate activity.
AB  - The rise of resistant bacteria has prompted the search for new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial membrane lytic peptides have potential as future microbial agents due to their novel mode of action. Recently conjugation of a fatty acid to antimicrobial peptides has been explored as a method to modulate the activity and selectivity of the peptide. Our work further explores these phenomena by testing two peptides, YGAAKKAAKAAKKAAKAA (AKK) and LKKLLKLLKLLKL (LKK), conjugated to fatty acids of varying length for their activity, structure, solution assembly properties and the ability to bind model membranes. We found that increasing the length of fatty acids conjugated to peptide AKK, up to a 16 carbons in length, increases the antimicrobial activity. Peptide AKK appears to lose activity when the minimal active concentration is higher than the critical miscelle concentration (CMC) of the molecule. Thus, if the CMC of the peptide conjugate is too low the activity is lost. Peptide LKK has no activity when conjugated to lauric acid and appears to aggregate at very low concentrations. Conjugation of AKK with a fatty acid increases its affinity to model supported lipid membranes. It appears that the increased hydrophobic interaction imparted by the fatty acid increases the affinity of the peptide to the surface thus increasing its activity. At concentrations above the CMC, solution self-assembly inhibits binding of the peptide to cell membranes.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20 against several micro-organisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities were determined using the microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms assayed, and for twelve of the eighteen micro-organisms (including the pathogenic Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were achieved for biosurfactant concentrations between 25 and 50 mg ml(-1). Furthermore, the biosurfactant showed antiadhesive activity against most of the micro-organisms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities of biosurfactants obtained from lactobacilli against such a broad group of micro-organisms. Although the antiadhesive activity of biosurfactants isolated from lactic acid bacteria has been widely reported, their antimicrobial activity is quite unusual and has been described only in a few strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study regarding the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of this biosurfactant opens future prospects for its use against micro-organisms responsible for diseases and infections in the urinary, vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the skin, making it a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Adhesion of microorganisms to bovine submaxillary mucin coatings: effect of coating deposition conditions.
AB  - The adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans on mucin coatings was evaluated to explore the feasibility of using the coating to increase the infection resistance of biomaterials. Coatings of bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) were deposited on a base layer consisting of a poly(acrylic acid-b-methyl methacrylate) (PAA-b-PMMA) diblock copolymer. This bi-layer system exploits the mucoadhesive interactions of the PAA block to aid the adhesion of mucin to the substratum, whereas the PMMA block prevents dissolution of the coating in aqueous environments. The thickness of the mucin coating was adjusted by varying the pH of the solution from which it was deposited. Thin mucin coatings decreased the numbers of bacteria but increased the numbers of C. albicans adhering to the copolymer and control surfaces. Increasing the mucin film thickness resulted in a further lowering of the density of adhering S. epidermidis cells, but it did not affect the density of E. coli. In contrast, the density of C. albicans increased with an increase in mucin thickness.
TI  - The diversity of antibacterial compounds of Terminalia species (Combretaceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of acetone, hexane, dichloromethane leaf extract of five Terminalia species (Terminalia alata Heyne ex Roth., Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wt. and Am., Terminalia bellerica (Gaertn.) Roxb., Terminalia catappa L. and Terminalia chebula Retz.) were tested by Agar-well-diffusion method against human pathogens E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The Rf values and relative activities of separated compounds were tested. Hexane and dichloromethane extracts have shown more antibacterial components than the acetone extract indicating the non-polar character of the antibacterial compounds. The non-polar character of the antibacterial compounds was confirmed from the Rf values. It indicated that the antibacterial activity was not due to tannins. Terminalia catappa found to possess the compounds which are more antibacterial. Terminalia arjuna and T. catappa plants were found most promising for isolating antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Chitosan-based microcapsules containing grapefruit seed extract grafted onto cellulose fibers by a non-toxic procedure.
AB  - A novel non-toxic procedure is described for the grafting of chitosan-based microcapsules containing grapefruit seed oil extract onto cellulose. The cellulose was previously UV-irradiated and then functionalized from an aqueous emulsion of the chitosan with the essential oil. The novel materials are readily attained with durable fragrance and enhanced antimicrobial properties. The incorporation of chitosan as determined from the elemental analyses data was 16.08+/-0.29 mg/g of sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) provided further evidence for the successful attachment of chitosan microcapsules containing the essential oil to the treated cellulose fibers. The materials thus produced displayed 100% inhibition of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis up to 48 h of incubation. Inhibition of bacteria by the essential oil was also evaluated at several concentrations.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and assessment of food-borne pathogenic bacteria in frozen  foods.
AB  - One hundred ninety-three frozen food samples collected in Korea various public bazaars from October 2006 to September 2007. Staphylococci were detected in 21.8% of frozen food samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 17 (8.8%) samples. Other staphylococci isolates were identified as S. warneri (7.8%), S. epidermidis (2.1%), S. xylosus (1.6%), S. eguorum (1%), and S. vitulinus (0.5%). Additionally, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 42 staphylococcal isolates to ten different antimicrobial agents was determined. The staphylococcal isolates demonstrated antimicrobial resistance to mupirocin (31%) oxacillin (14.3%), gentamicin (9.5%), teicoplanin (7.1%) and ciprofloxacin (7.1%). Most of the staphylococcal isolates showed high-level resistance to mupirocin (MIC(90), >128 microg/mL). Fortunately, most of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. The total bacteria and Escherichia coli count were tested to investigate the microbiological quality of frozen foods. From 193 frozen food samples, 43 (22.3%), 34 (17.6%) and 19 (9.8%) samples were shown to be of unacceptable quality due to total bacteria, coliform and E. coli counts, respectively.
TI  - Inhibition of sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by bovine serum albumin (BSA). The killing of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli by NaOCl in concentrations from 2% to 0.03% was measured in the presence of BSA in concentrations between 6.7% and 0.1%. METHODS: NaOCl, BSA, and microorganism suspensions were mixed, and, after 30 seconds, 6 minutes, and 30 minutes, samples were taken and NaOCl was inactivated by 5% sodium thiosulphate. The microbes were incubated in tryptic soy broth broth for up to 7 days for the detection of growth. RESULTS: All microorganisms were killed within 30 seconds by 0.03% NaOCl when BSA was not present. High concentrations of BSA significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl against the four species. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of sodium hypochlorite by BSA was directly dependent on their quantitative relationships. The result partly explains the poorer performance in vivo of NaOCl as compared to in vitro experiments.
TI  - Development of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for eubacterial RNA detection in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates (PCs) was improved by detection of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in addition to DNA. The real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was compared with the BacT/ALERT culturing system (bioMerieux) to determine its value for routine screening of PCs for bacterial contamination. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of the assay was determined by spiking PCs with serial dilutions of bacteria. RNA amplification was performed with real-time RT-PCR, using a universal primer and probe set based on the conserved 16S rRNA gene of bacteria. Routinely prepared PCs in plasma were spiked with low bacterial titers of four different bacteria to compare the real-time RT-PCR with the BacT/ALERT. For the BacT/ALERT, samples were taken directly after spiking. For the real-time RT-PCR, samples were taken daily during 7 days of storage. RESULTS: RNA detection improved the sensitivity of the PCR assay at least 10-fold. When PCs were spiked with low bacterial titers, all positive samples were detected by the real-time RT-PCR after 48 hours. The BacT/ALERT became positive for almost all samples within 24 hours. However, some positive PC samples remained negative in the BacT/ALERT. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of the PCR assay was improved by detection of rRNA. A spiking study demonstrated the advantage of late sampling for PCR testing compared to early sampling for culturing with the BacT/ALERT system. A real-time RT-PCR assay that is performed on PCs during storage or shortly before transfusion can be a good alternative to culturing methods.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Pathogen incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in children.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in children with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in order to optimize empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. from 2001 to 2006, 895 children with an indwelling catheter from 3 hospitals in China were included in this study, of whom 335 (37.4%) had CAUTI. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 450 bacterial isolates was performed using the ClSi broth and Kirby-bauer agar dilution methods. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus spp. E. coli had higher susceptibility to ceftazidime (87.4%), cefuroxime (85.1%) and cefatrizine (76.6%) than to sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (8.0%), amoxicillin (21.7%), ampicillin (17.1%) and cefazolin (37.7%). Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus species had similar patterns as E. coli. S. aureus had lower susceptibility to SmZ (6.8%), ampicillin (8.2%), and amoxicillin (24.7%); the trend of S. epidermidis was similar. This study demonstrates that the Gram-negative species are the predominating uropathogens of CAUti in children. it is important to know the bacterial spectrum and the susceptibility patterns to various classes of antibiotic agents to improve empiric antibiotic therapy of children with CAUTI in China.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and outcome of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis in Qatar.
AB  - Peritoneal dialysis therapy rapidly expanded in Qatar during the last decade. Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis remains the leading cause of morbidity and technique failure. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis in Qatar, during a five year study period. The records of all patients on maintenance peritoneal dialysis from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007 were reviewed. Episodes of peritonitis, microbial profile, clinical course and outcome were analyzed. A total of 241 patients were included, males represented 74%, the mean age was 53 + or - 13 years, and 48% of patients were diabetics. During the study period 118 episode of peritonitis were observed, with a mean incidence of 0.24 + or - 0.1 episodes per patient year. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 40% of episodes, with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hemolyticus being the commonest organisms, isolated in 21% and 9% of infections, respectively. Escherichia coli was the commonest Gram-negative organism and was isolated in 9% of peritonitis episodes, whereas culture-negative peritonitis represented 28% of all diagnosed infections. Seventy nine percent of peritonitis episodes completely resolved with the use of intraperitoneal antimicrobial therapy. Peritoneal dialysis catheters were removed in 19% of episodes. Peritonitis related mortality rate was 3%, and it was due to Candida spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite its low incidence, peritonitis remained the leading cause of patient dropout. Prompt diagnosis and prudent management as well as psychological support to the patients remained essential to reduce the incidence of technique failure following peritonitis episodes.
TI  - Simultaneous pasteurization and homogenization of human milk by combining heat and ultrasound: effect on milk quality.
AB  - The combination of ultrasound and heat (thermoultrasound) is an emerging food preservation technique that retains higher quantities of bioactive components compared with current thermal pasteurization practice, but has not yet been assessed for pasteurizing human milk. Artificially contaminated human milk samples were treated with ultrasound (20 kHz, 150 watts) with and without heating. The retention of four human milk proteins was quantified by biochemical assay and laser scattering particle sizing was used to determine the extent of homogenization. While ultrasonic treatment was effective at inactivating Escherichia coli (D4 degrees C=5.94 min), Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited resistance (D4 degrees C=16.01 min). Thermoultrasonic treatment was considerably more effective (Esch. coli D45 degrees C=1.74 min, D50 degrees C=0.89 min; Staph. epidermidis D45 degrees C=2.08 min, D50 degrees C=0.94 minutes) with a predicted retention (2.8 min treatment, 50 degrees C) of secretory IgA lysozyme, lactoferrin and bile salt stimulated lipase of 91, 80, 77, and 45%, respectively. Homogenization of the milk samples occurred after 5 min and 2 min of ultrasonic and thermoultrasonic treatment, respectively. Thermoultrasonic treatment is an effective method for pasteurizing donor human milk and retaining a greater proportion of bioactive components compared with current practices. However, further studies are required to assess the practicality of applying this technique routinely to donor human milk.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - The biocompatability of mesoporous inorganic-organic hybrid resin films with ionic and hydrophilic characteristics.
AB  - New mesoporous silicate-titania resin systems hybridized with 4,5-dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonic acid and poly(ethylene glycol)-dimethacrylate component were developed. These inorganic-organic hybrid resins were found to reveal highly controlled ionic and hydrophilic surface with excellent durability and adhesion onto various substrates. The resin films revealed high resistance to nonspecific adsorption of fibrinogen and to adherence by several bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility of the developed resins was proved by both HEp-2 cell adhesion in vitro and subcutaneous implantation in mice. The inorganic-organic hybrid resins are strongly promising for biomedical applications including biomedical devices and biosensors.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles produced by chemical  reduction method.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The most prominent nanoparticles for medical uses are nanosilver particles which are famous for their high anti-microbial activity. Silver ion has been known as a metal ion that exhibit anti-mold, anti-microbial and anti-algal properties for a long time. In particular, it is widely used as silver nitrate aqueous solution which has disinfecting and sterilizing actions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity as well as physical properties of the silver nanoparticles prepared by chemical reduction method. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by reduction of silver nitrate in the presence of a reducing agent and also poly [N-vinylpyrolidone] (PVP) as a stabilizer. Two kinds of NPs were synthesized by ethylene glycol (EG) and glucose as reducing agent. The nanostructure and particle size of silver NPs were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle analyzer (LPA). The formations of the silver NPs were monitored using ultraviolet- visible spectroscopy. The anti-bacterial activity of silver NPs were assessed by determination of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) as well as Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The silver nanoparticles were spherical with particle size between 10 to 250 nm. Analysis of the theoretical (Mie light scattering theory) and experimental results showed that the silver NPs in colloidal solution had a diameter of approximately 50 nm. Both colloidal silver NPs showed high anti-bacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Glucose nanosilver colloids showed a shorter killing time against most of the tested bacteria which could be due to their nanostructures and uniform size distribution patterns.
TI  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from Salvia rosifolia Sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
AB  - Four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MWHD), microdistillation (MD) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (MSD-SPME), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of Salvia rosifolia Sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. HD and MWHD techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-Pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this Turkish endemic species. Besides, the hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a MIC value of 125microg/mL. Other human pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (MIC=125-1000microg/mL). Antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. No cytotoxicity was observed for S. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/mL against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of light-activated polyurethane containing indocyanine green.
AB  - The aim of this study was to produce novel antimicrobial polymers containing the  light-activated antimicrobial agent indocyanine green (ICG). The novel materials were prepared by swelling polyurethane in acetone containing water and ICG, followed by solvent evaporation. The uptake of ICG was dependent upon the ratio of acetone to water. Only at a ratio of 99 parts acetone to 1 part water was there any substantial colouration of the samples. When exposed to laser light from the near infrared spectrum (808 nm), polyurethane-containing ICG exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria; a 2 log(1)(0) reduction was achieved against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis after 15 min exposure, corresponding to an energy dose of 31.83 J delivered at an energy density of 31.83 J/cm(2). Under the same conditions, Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) appeared to be less susceptible, the viable count being reduced by 0.5 log(1)(0). Some of the physical properties of the resulting material were also investigated and it was found that the elasticity (Young's modulus) was reduced by approximately 60%. Furthermore, when the ICG-containing polymer was stretched, the breaking point occurred when the elongation was 6.7 times the initial value, while ICG-free polyurethane samples did not break following a 7-fold elongation. The contact angles for water droplets revealed that the ICG-containing polymer was more hydrophobic than untreated polyurethane. The results of this study show that ICG can be embedded in polyurethane to produce materials which when irradiated with near-infrared light can exert a bactericidal effect particularly against MRSA and S. epidermidis. Such materials may be useful for preparing intravenous catheters, which are often colonized by such organisms.
TI  - Treatment of whole blood (WB) and red blood cells (RBC) with S-303 inactivates pathogens and retains in vitro quality of stored RBC.
AB  - A pathogen inactivation (PI) process has been developed using the frangible anchor linker effector (FRALE) compound S-303. A series of experiments were performed in whole blood (WB) to measure the level of viral and bacterial inactivation. The results showed that 0.2mM S-303 and 2mM glutathione (GSH) inactivated >6.5 logs of HIV, >5.7 logs of Bluetongue virus, >7.0 logs of Yersinia enterocolitica, 4.2 logs of Serratia marcescens, and 7.5 logs of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Recent development for S-303 is focused on optimization of the PI process for red blood cell concentrates (RBC). A series of studies in RBC showed that 0.2mM S-303 and 20mM GSH inactivated approximately 5 logs or greater of Y. enterocolitica, E. coli, S. marcescens, S. aureus, HIV, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bluetongue virus and human adenovirus 5. In both applications of the S-303 process, in vitro parameters of RBC function and physiology were retained compared to conventional RBC. Results from these studies indicate that S-303 can be applicable for PI of RBC and WB.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of small beta-peptidomimetics based on the pharmacophore model of short cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - We have synthesized a series of small beta-peptidomimetics (M(w) <650) that were  based on the minimal pharmacophore model for anti-Staphylococcal activity of short cationic antimicrobial peptides. All beta-peptidomimetics had a net charge of +2 and formed an amphipathic scaffold consisting of an achiral lipophilic beta(2,2)-amino acid coupled to a C-terminal l-arginine amide residue. By varying the lipophilic side-chains of the beta(2,2)-amino acids, we obtained a series of highly potent beta-peptidomimetics with high enzymatic stability against alpha-chymotrypsin and a general low toxicity against human erythrocytes. The most potent beta-peptidomimetics displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2.1-7.2 muM against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and Escherichia coli. Small amphipathic beta-peptidomimetics may be a promising class of antimicrobial agents by means of having a similar range of potency and selectivity as larger cationic antimicrobial peptides in addition to improved enzymatic stability and lower costs of production.
TI  - [Influence of premature rupture of membranes on neonatal health].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) on neonatal health. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3320 in-patient newborns of Bayi Children's Hospital from October 2006 to March 2008. One hundred term newborns and one hundred preterm newborns with PROM were chosen to be compared with fifty normal term newborns and preterm newborns respectively. The data were analyzed with Minitab 12.0 software. RESULT: Of the 3320 newborns, 711 (21.4%) were complicated with PROM. The morbidity of PROM was 21.4% (711/3320), among whom 9.69% (196/2022) were term newborns, 39.68% (515/1298) were preterm newborns, the differences between the term and the preterm newborns were statistically significant (P<0.001). Preterm newborns with PROM accounted for 72.43% of all PROM newborns (515/711). However, preterm infants only accounted for 30.01% of the newborns without PROM. Sixty-nine newborns with PROM had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), incidence of which was 9.7% (69/711): 10 (5.1%) term newborns and 59 (11.5%) preterm newborns, of whom 3 developed broncho-pulmonary dysplasia Among all patients with PROM, 25% (178/711) newborns had different infectious diseases: 92 (12.9%) had pneumonia and 63 (8.9%) had septicemia, which totally accounted for 87.1% of the patients with infectious diseases, 23 (3.2%) newborns had other infectious diseases including peritonitis, purulent meningitis, urinary system infection, skin infection, perianal infection and conjunctivitis, which accounted for 12.9% of the patients with infectious diseases. Blood culture was performed for 163 newborns with PROM, the positive rate of the culture was 38.7% (63/163). The main pathogenic bacteria detected in blood culture were Gram-positive cocci (45.9%) and Gram-negative rods (54.1%). Gram-positive cocci mainly included Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (16/63). Gram-negative rods included K. pneumoniae (19/63) and Escherichia coli (9/63). Fungi were detected in two preterm infants (3.2%). There was no significant difference in the level of total serum bilirubin between term newborns and preterm newborns with PROM (P>0.05). Total serum bilirubin level of 37.1% of total preterm newborns with PROM exceeded 220 micromol/L, while it was 29.1% in term newborns with PROM (P<0.05). There was a significant decrease of blood platelet count (P<0.01) between the PROM group and the normal group. The myocardial enzymes including lactate dehydrogenases, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase of PROM group were significantly higher than those of the normal group (P<0.05). Compared with the normal group, the average hospital stay of term newborns with PROM and preterm newborns with PROM were prolonged by 20.0% and 25.1% respectively, the average cost of hospitalization of them were increased 30.5% and 60.0% respectively. CONCLUSION: PROM is harmful to newborns health in many ways. Studies on PROM should be enhanced.
TI  - New antimicrobial hexapeptides: synthesis, antimicrobial activities, cytotoxicity, and mechanistic studies.
AB  - Synthetic antimicrobial peptides have recently emerged as promising candidates against drug-resistant pathogens. We identified a novel hexapeptide, Orn-D-Trp-D-Phe-Ile-D-Phe-His(1-Bzl)-NH(2), which exhibits broad-spectrum antifungal and antibacterial activity. A lead optimization was undertaken by conducting a full amino acid scan with various proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids depending on the hydrophobic or positive-charge character of residues at various positions along the sequence. The hexapeptide was also cyclized to study the correlation between the linear and cyclic structures and their respective antimicrobial activities. The synthesized peptides were found to be active against the fungus Candida albicans and Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli; MIC values for the most potent structures were in the range of 1-5 microg mL(-1) (IC(50) values in the range of 0.02-2 microg mL(-1)). Most of the synthesized peptides showed no cytotoxic effects in an MTT assay up to the highest test concentration of 200 microg mL(-1). A tryptophan fluorescence quenching study was performed in the presence of negatively charged and zwitterionic model membranes, mimicking bacterial and mammalian membranes, respectively. The results of the fluorescence study demonstrate that the tested peptides are selective toward bacterial over mammalian cells; this is associated with a preferential interaction between the peptides and the negatively charged phospholipids of bacterial cells.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Propionibacterium acnes. Non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. Two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tK100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. High and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/mL) were used. Silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. RESULTS: The silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tK100 assay at high inoculum. At low inoculum S. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against E. coli but without complete eradication. MRSA was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. The in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. Silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. CONCLUSIONS: The commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate MRSA or E. coli and while it showed activity against S. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. This is consistent with clinical studies on silver-processed catheters.
TI  - A comparison of superficial and deep bacterial presence in open fractures of the  lower extremities.
AB  - This open prospective study compared the bacterial flora of superficial and deep-wound biopsies and swabs over a 2-year period in 4 different samples cultured from open fracture wounds at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Samples were taken from 47 patients with factures graded according to Gustilo and Anderson's classification as grade 1 (2.1%), grade II (29.8%), grade IIIA (36.2%), and grade IIIB (31%). A total of 248 samples were cultured using standard techniques. The incidence of open fracture wounds was 78.7% in male patients and 21.3% in female patients. Tibia fractures constituted 66.1%. A total of 203 bacterial isolates were cultured from 248 samples. Gram-negative bacteria constituted 53.2% of isolates, with Escherichia coli being predominant (12.8%). Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant Gram-positive cocci (15.3%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.3%) may be considered to be the major source of open fracture wound contamination. The bacterial species cultured from superficial and deep-wound swabs and biopsies were similar. Resistance to antimicrobials was high for penicillins (amoxicillin and cloxacillin), with values of 68.6% and 58.3%, respectively, for superficial bacterial species and 58.2% and 31.9%, respectively, for deep-wound biopsies.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in Northern  India and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. Data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. In vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. RESULTS: A total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. Of these, 255 (87.3%) were Gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were Gram-negative. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. Overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). Organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. The addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.
TI  - Effect of ciprofloxacin and N-acetylcysteine on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on ureteral stent surfaces.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ciprofloxacin (CIP), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone and in combination on biofilm production and pre-formed mature biofilms on ureteral stent surfaces. Two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebseilla pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, recently isolated from patients undergoing ureteral stent removal and shown to be capable of biofilm production, were used in this study. The inhibitory effects of ciprofloxacin, N-acetylcysteine and ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine combination were determined by static adherence assay. Ciprofloxacin (MIC and 2 MIC) and N-acetylcysteine (2 and 4 mg/ml) inhibited biofilm production by > or = 60% in all tested microorganisms. Disruption of pre-formed biofilms of all tested microorganisms was found to be > or = 78% in the presence of ciprofloxacin (MIC and 2 MIC) and > or = 62% in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (2 and 4 mg/ml), compared to controls. Ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine showed the highest inhibitory effect on biofilm production (94-100%) and the highest disruptive effect on the pre-formed biofilms (86-100%) in comparison to controls. N-acetylcysteine was found to increase the therapeutic efficacy of ciprofloxacin by degrading the extracellular polysaccharide matrix of biofilms. These data are statistically significant. The inhibitory effects of ciprofloxacin and N-acetylcysteine on biofilm production were also verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM). In conclusion, Ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine combinations have the highest inhibitory effect on biofilm production and the highest ability to eradicate pre-formed mature biofilms.
TI  - Management of vascular graft infections with soft tissue flap coverage: improving limb salvage rates--a veterans affairs experience.
AB  - Graft infections are one of the most challenging issues in surgery with an incidence of 0.7 to 7 per cent, with femoral site infections being the most common (13% incidence). The gold standard treatment has been graft removal, wide debridement, and extra-anatomical bypass. Routine excision of infected peripheral arterial grafts and vascular reconstruction with extraanatomic conduits are associated with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 30 per cent and amputation rates of up to 70 per cent. As a result of the high morbidity and mortality associated with this approach, selective graft preservation techniques have been developed. Newer treatment plans discuss preservation of the graft with debridement and coverage of the infected region. Better wound care, nutrition optimization, and robust flap coverage have led to significantly improved graft salvage, lower amputation rates, and improved outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the Veterans Affairs (VA) experience with flap coverage for femoral vascular graft infections. A retrospective review was conducted of all VA data from 1997 to 2008 with inclusion criteria of patients with deep groin wound infections requiring flap coverage after femoral bypass surgery. Eleven such patients were identified with a mean age of 73 years and with multiple comorbidities (hypertension, malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency). Patients presented with wound drainage, exposed graft, hematoma, perigraft fluid collection, and pseudoaneurysm. Treatment protocol included: 1) aggressive debridement of the wound bed; 2) early soft tissue (flap) coverage; 3) wound vacuum assisted closure device or frequent dressing changes; and 4) skin graft once the bed was prepared. Eighty-two per cent of wounds had positive cultures with equal numbers of patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli (22%), and higher methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (33%), whereas in the literature Staphylococcus is the most common (greater than 50%). Average hospital length of stay was 94 days with average follow up at 10 months. Fifty-five per cent graft salvage (one Dacron [50%], two polytetrafluoroethylene [33%], two saphenous vein graft [100%], one cryovein [100%]) was achieved with 91 per cent limb salvage. Complications included graft blowout (two) requiring partial flap loss (one), retroperitoneal hematoma (one), limb loss (one), sepsis (one), and death (one). Infected vascular grafts remain a challenging problem requiring multidisciplinary care. Careful debridement and aggressive wound care followed by selective flap coverage appears to decrease morbidity and increase graft and limb salvage.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of bismuth-fluoroquinolone complexes against Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Novel organometallic compounds have been prepared by complexing the fluoroquinolones, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, lomefloxacin, pefloxacin and gatifloxacin, with bismuth. The complexes were characterized by UV, IR, atomic absorption spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and mass spectrometry. Their antibacterial potential against Helicobacter pylori and other microorganisms was investigated. These compounds were found to possess strong activity against Helicobacter pylori with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 mg L-1. They also exhibited moderate activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These bismuth-fluoroquinolone complexes have the potential to be developed as drugs against H. pylori related ailments.
TI  - The microbial colonisation of mobile phone used by healthcare staffs.
AB  - Mobile phones are dispensable accessories in social life and normally they are not cleaned properly. Therefore, they serve as a reservoir of bacteria and may cause nosocomial infections in hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate microbiological colonization of mobile phones used by healthcare staffs. The study was carried out collecting swab samples with Cary-Blair transport medium from mobile phones of attending healthcare staffs from different departments of three hospitals in March, 2008. All collected samples were inoculated in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin-methylene blue agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Isolated bacteria were identified using by classic technique and Vitec2 (Biomerieux, France) full automated bacteria identification system. Growth was observed in 65 of collected 106 samples, corresponding to 61.3%. The most frequent bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli, respectively. In conclusion, bacteria were colonized on mobile phones frequently and mobile phones may become reservoir of microorganism for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Persistence of antimicrobial activity through sustained release of triclosan from pegylated silicone elastomers.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to silicone elastomer biomaterials is a major problem often resulting in infection and medical device failure. Several strategies have been employed to modulate eukaryotic cell adhesion and to hamper bacterial adherence to polymeric biomaterials. Chemical modification of the surface by grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains or the incorporation of non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents such as triclosan into the biomaterial matrix may reduce bacterial adhesion. Here, such strategies are simultaneously applied to the preparation of both condensation-cure and addition-cure silicone elastomer systems, seeking a sustained release antimicrobial device biomaterial. The influence of triclosan incorporation and degree of pegylation on antimicrobial release, surface microbial adherence and persistence (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were evaluated in vitro. Non-pegylated silicone elastomers provided an increased percentage release of triclosan extending over a relatively short duration (99% release by day 64) compared with their pegylated (4% w/w) counterparts (65% and 72% release by day 64, for condensation and addition-cure systems respectively). Viable E. coli adherence to a non-pegylated silicone elastomer containing 1% w/w triclosan was reduced by over 99% after 24 h compared to the non-pegylated silicone elastomer containing no triclosan. No viable S. epidermidis adhered to any of the triclosan-loaded (>0.1% w/w) formulations other than the control. Persistence of the antimicrobial activity of the triclosan-loaded pegylated silicone elastomers continued for at least 70 days compared to the triclosan-loaded non-pegylated elastomers (at least 49 days). Understanding how PEG affects the release of triclosan from silicone elastomers may prove useful in the development of a biomaterial providing prolonged, effective antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Biofouling characteristics using flow field-flow fractionation: effect of bacteria and membrane properties.
AB  - In this study, membrane biofouling caused by bacteria that have different characteristics was evaluated using flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF). Three different bacteria which differed from size and shape (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Flavobacterium lutescens) were investigated with GM ultrafiltration (UF, rough with a low negative surface charge and relatively high hydrophobicity) and NE70 nanofiltration (NF, smooth with a high negative surface charge and relatively low hydrophobicity) membranes. The FlFFF retention time of S. epidermidis, E. coli and F. lutescens was highly influenced by the ionic strength of the solution and the surface polarity of the membranes and bacteria. The NF membrane was found to have a higher potential of biofouling than the UF membrane with the bacteria tested in this study. E. coli was the most significant biofoulant among the bacteria tested on both membrane surfaces based on FlFFF retention times compared to other bacteria.
TI  - Decreased linezolid uptake in an in vitro-selected linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis mutant.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of resistance to linezolid in an in vitro-selected linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis mutant. METHODS: A linezolid-resistant strain of S. epidermidis was selected by serial passages with increasing concentrations of linezolid. The MICs of linezolid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, rifampicin, vancomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin were determined. The 23S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced, to search for mutations conferring linezolid resistance. The MIC of linezolid was also determined in the presence of reserpine. Finally, the accumulation of linezolid was measured and quantified by HPLC/UV. RESULTS: The obtained resistant strain had an MIC of linezolid of 64 mg/L and was stable after several passages on blood agar. The MIC measured in the presence of 25 mg/L reserpine, an efflux pump inhibitor, was not altered (MIC of 64 mg/L). The sequence of the 23S rRNA gene showed that the mutation G2576T (Escherichia coli numbering) was not present and no other mutation was found. An analysis of the accumulation of linezolid was performed, comparing the uptake of the resistant strain with that of the susceptible one. This showed that the resistant strain had significantly lower levels of linezolid accumulation than its susceptible parental strain. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of resistance to linezolid, in this resistant strain, may be related to a decrease in the antimicrobial uptake. This new mechanism of resistance was also related to a little loss of fitness.
TI  - Evaluation of the type I signal peptidase as antibacterial target for biofilm-associated infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The development of antibacterial resistance is inevitable and is a major concern  in hospitals and communities. Moreover, biofilm-grown bacteria are less sensitive to antimicrobial treatment. In this respect, the Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important source of nosocomial biofilm-associated infections. In the search for new antibacterial therapies, the type I signal peptidase (SPase I) serves as a potential target for development of antibacterials with a novel mode of action. This enzyme cleaves off the signal peptide from secreted proteins, making it essential for protein secretion, and hence for bacterial cell viability. S. epidermidis encodes three putative SPases I (denoted Sip1, Sip2 and Sip3), of which Sip1 lacks the catalytic lysine. In this report, we investigated the active S. epidermidis SPases I in more detail. Sip2 and Sip3 were found to complement a temperature-sensitive Escherichia coli lepB mutant, demonstrating their in vivo functional activity. In vitro functional activity of purified Sip2 and Sip3 proteins and inhibition of their activity by the SPase I inhibitor arylomycin A(2) were further illustrated using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SPase I not only is an attractive target for development of novel antibacterials against free-living bacteria, but also is a feasible target for biofilm-associated infections.
TI  - In vitro assessment of the antibiotic efficacy of contrast media and antibiotics  and their combinations at various dilutions.
AB  - Discography is a controversial diagnostic procedure involving the injection of radiographic contrast medium (RCM) into the intervertebral disc. Iatrogenic bacterial discitis is a rare but serious complication. The intervention has been increasingly performed in our patients here in the United Arab Emirates. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administration can reduce post-interventional discitis; however, this may favour the development of bacterial resistance. Direct intradiscal injection of an antibiotic together with the RCM is a potential alternative. To date, there has been only one study on the efficacy of antibiotics added to an RCM. Equally, there are only limited data regarding the potential direct effect of RCM on bacterial growth. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of antibiotics is affected when RCM are added. In an in vitro study, the effect of non-ionic RCM on the growth of five laboratory bacterial strains, alone and in combination with three broad-spectrum antimicrobials, was tested. Bacterial growth was assessed in the absence and the presence of RCM, antibiotics and their combinations. All three RCM alone demonstrated some inhibition of bacterial growth at high concentrations. In the presence of the RCM, all three antibiotics retained their inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments did not reveal any changes in the antimicrobial efficacy of the three antibiotics in the presence of the three tested RCM. Subsequent clinical trials will need to assess whether intradiscal antibiotic administration may be a suitable substitute for, or a supplement to, prophylactic systemic antibiotics before discography.
TI  - The uropathogenic species Staphylococcus saprophyticus tolerates a high concentration of D-serine.
AB  - Human urine contains a relatively high concentration of d-serine, which is toxic  to several nonuropathogenic bacteria, but can be utilized or detoxified by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The sequenced genome of uropathogenic Staphylococcus saprophyticus contains a gene with homology to the d-serine deaminase gene (dsdA) of UPEC. We found the gene in several clinical isolates of S. saprophyticus; however, the gene was absent in Staphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus cohnii, phylogenetically close relatives of S. saprophyticus, and could also not be detected in isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and 13 other staphylococcal species. In addition, the genomes of other sequenced staphylococci do not harbor homologues of this operon. Interestingly, S. saprophyticus could grow in media supplemented with relatively high concentrations of d-serine, whereas S. aureus, S. epidermidis and other staphylococcal species could not. The association of the dsdA gene with growth in media including d-serine was proved by introducing the gene into S. aureus Newman. Given the fact that UPEC and S. saprophyticus tolerate this compound, d-serine utilization and detoxification may be a general property of uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Constituents of the leaves of Magnolia ovata.
AB  - Two new lignans, magnovatins A (1) and B (2), along with nine known compounds, were isolated from the leaves of Magnolia ovata. The known compounds were identified as acuminatin (3), licarin A (4), kadsurenin M, 4-O-demethylkadsurenin M, oleiferin A, oleiferin C, spathulenol, parthenolide, and 11,13-dehydrocompressanolide. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 yielded four new derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b). The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of spectrometric data evaluation. Free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities of the major compunds 1, 3, and 4 were investigated.
TI  - Infections associated with prosthetic repairs of abdominal wall hernias: pathology, management and results.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse clinical and demographic factors of patients who suffered infection of the surgical site requiring mesh removal as a complication of prosthetic repairs, details of the hernioplasties in which meshes were implanted and their management and outcomes. METHODS: Factors related to infection (demographic variables and characteristics of the repairs and mesh utilised) and the management before proceeding to mesh removal were obtained from patient charts. Collected specimens (meshes and tissues) from 32 consecutive patients were cultured and observed microscopically. The outcomes after mesh removal were prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients underwent incisional hernioplasties and ten inguinal hernioplasties; most of the procedures took a long time, and 28 patients presented early wound complications (seroma or haematoma). During the "implantation-removal" interval, some conservative treatments, such as drainages or sinus resection, were attempted under local anaesthesia. Twenty-two meshes were totally removed (nine after partial extraction); in the remaining ten cases partially removal was successful. Most of the meshes (24) were made of multi-filament polypropylene; microscopic observation of neighbouring tissues showed leucocyte infiltration, giant cell reaction, disorganisation of the collagen fibres and abscedation. Treatment of 32 patients required 51 operations. Following mesh removal, there were six recurrences and two fistulas of the bowel. The average follow-up was 40 months (30-97). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the infections requiring mesh removal were related to prolonged repair operations that presented untreated early postoperative wound complications. Partial extraction of meshes frequently leads to failures and complications. Surgical exploration should be performed under general anaesthesia to accomplish complete mesh extraction.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - Capillary electromigration separation of proteins and microorganisms dynamically  modified by chromophoric nonionogenic surfactant.
AB  - A chromophoric nonionogenic surfactant poly(ethylene glycol) 3-(2-hydroxy-5-n-octylphenylazo)-benzoate, HOPAB, has been prepared and used as a buffer additive for a dynamic modification of proteins and/or microorganisms including Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus epidermidis (biofilm-positive and biofilm-negative), and the strains of yeast cells Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis (biofilm-positive and biofilm-negative) during a capillary electrophoresis and a capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) with UV detection at 326 nm. Values of isoelectric points of labeled proteins and microorganisms have been calculated using UV-detectable pI markers and have been found comparable with pI of the native compounds. Minimum detectable amount has been assessed lower than picograms of proteins and lower than a hundred cells injected into a separation capillary. The introduced labeling method facilitates CIEF separation of microorganisms from the clinical sample of the infected urine at their clinically important levels in the pH gradient pH range of 2-5 and their subsequent cultivation. At the same time, it has enabled the determination of albumin in human urine as a major clinical marker of urinary tract infections and kidney diseases.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Efficacy of electrolyzed water and an acidic formulation compared with regularly  used chemical sanitizers for tableware sanitization during mechanical and manual ware-washing protocols.
AB  - This study investigated residual bacteria and different food types left on tableware items after various washing and sanitization protocols. Escherichia coli K-12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis were inoculated into whole milk and soft cream cheese. The milk was used to contaminate regular drinking glasses and the cheese was used to contaminate plates and silverware. These tableware items were washed in manual (43 degrees C) and mechanical (49 degrees C) washers and sanitized with different sanitizers (24 degrees C) for 5 s. Quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite, peroxyacetic acid, neutral electrolyzed water (NEW), and a combination of citric acid with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (acidic formulation) were used as the chemical sanitizers. Tap water was used as a control. Results showed that at least 5-log reductions in both bacterial numbers were achieved for all sanitizers in both types of washers, except for the control. With mechanical dishwashing, the NEW and acidic formulation treatments reduced bacterial populations by >6.9 and >6.0 log CFU per tableware item, respectively. With the manual operation, bacterial numbers were reduced by >5.4 and >6.0 log CFU per tableware item, respectively. This study revealed that NEW and the acidic formulation are as effective as the other chemical sanitizers for food contact surface sanitization in manual and mechanical ware washing.
TI  - Synthesis of some novel pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine and pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives bearing 5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine moiety as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The reaction of 5,6-diphenyl-3-hydrazino-1,2,4-triazine (1) with bis(methylthio)methylene]malononitrile (2) afforded 5-amino-1-(5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)-3-(methylthio)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonit rile (3). Compound 3 reacted with thiourea to give 3,4-diaminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine 5, which was treated with benzoyl chloride to give pyrazolo[5,4,3-kl]pyrimido[4,3-d]pyrimidine 6. Treatment of 3 with acetic anhydride produced 3-methylthio-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative 7, which was allowed to react with hydrazine hydrate to give the corresponding hydrazino derivative 8. Heterocyclization of 8 with benzoyl chloride and sodium pyruvate afforded the polyfused heterocycles 9 and 10, respectively. Reaction of 3 with benzoylacetone yielded pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine 12, which was allowed to react with malononitrile and acetanilide to get heterocyclic systems 13 and 14, respectively. Interaction of 3 with cyanoacetone gave pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine 15, which was refluxed in formic acid to yield pyrazolo[4',3':5,6]pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine 16. Reaction of 3 with 2 afforded the triazinylpyrazole derivative 17, which was reacted with hydrazine hydrate to give dipyrazolo[1,5-a:3',4'-d]pyrimidine 19. Furthermore, treatment of the latter compound with methyl anthranilate furnished tetraheterocyclic compound 21. Structures of the products have been determined by elemental analysis and spectral studies. All compounds have been screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Compounds 9, 10, 13, 19 and 21 showed maximum activity comparable to the standard drugs with lower toxicity in the case of 9 and 10.
TI  - In vivo model of human pathogen infection and demonstration of efficacy by an antimicrobial pouch for pacing devices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. Once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of the AIGIS(RX) antibacterial envelope (TyRx Pharma, Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) designed to reduce device-related infections by incorporating minocycline and rifampin in a controlled release polymer. METHODS: An infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without AIGIS(RX) was placed. The incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. After 7 days, devices were explanted and sampled for viable bacteria by swabbing and sonication. RESULTS: Initial studies evaluated the ability of the AIGIS(RX) pouch to reduce Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi) infection in this model using clinical and quantitative microbial endpoints. Results demonstrate S. epi infection in all control samples, while no pathogens were recovered from samples with the AIGIS(RX) pouch. Systemic antibiotic levels were undetectable. Additional studies tested the efficacy of the AIGIS(RX) pouch with additional bacterial strains, Staphylococcus capitis, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter Baumannii. In each case, the device and implant pocket with the AIGIS(RX) pouch was free of any signs of infection. An assessment of biofilm produced by Acinetobacter demonstrated the elimination of biofilm formation on the implanted device. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that in this animal model, the AIGIS(RX) device reduces the risk for infection of viable pathogens within implant pockets.
TI  - [Etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake. METHODS: 2135 smears of secretion were made from 1823 hospitalized wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake to detect the pathogens. Specimens were delivered to be cultured. The bacteria thus obtained were identified. Drug sensitivity test was conducted. RESULTS: 2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake. CONCLUSION: Infection is frequent after natural disasters. It is necessary to summarize the changes of spectrum of pathogens and drug-resistant spectrum.
TI  - [Ten-year changes in pathogen, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical feature  of children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite progress in antibiotic therapy and intensive care, childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) remains a devastating disease. We conducted this study to investigate the changes in clinical characteristics, the etiologic agents and antimicrobial susceptibility of BM during the past 10 years in children under 14 years of age. METHODS: These 126 patients were divided into two groups according to their date of admission. Group 1 included 64 patients admitted from January 1998 to December 2002, and group 2 included 62 cases admitted from January 2003 to December 2007. All pediatric medical charts of them were reviewed. RESULTS: The predominant isolated bacteria from CSF were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (17/62, 27.4%) and Escherichia coli (9/62, 14.5%) in group 2. The resistance rate of staphylococcus against oxacillin (MRS) was 68.4% (13/19) in group 2, significantly higher than that of group 1 (16.7%, 2/12). Among 126 cases, 42 had seizure attack and 16 had consciousness disturbance, the proportions of them in group 2 (11/62, 17.7%; 4/62, 6.4%) were lower than those in group 1 (31/64, 48.4%; 12/64, 18.8%, P < 0.05). Cases in group 2 survived with complications [13/62 (21.0%)] and sequelae [11/62 (17.7%)] were lower than those in group 1 (24/64, 37.5%, 23/64, 35.9%, P < 0.05), but the rate of empirical therapy modification in group 2 (21/62, 33.9%) was higher than that in group 1 (7/64, 10.9%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The predominant bacteria in children with BM are staphylococcus and Escherichia coli in recent years. The antibiotic resistance rate of bacteria has been higher year after year. The clinical patterns of pediatric BM have changed with a decrease in clinically serious cases, complications and sequelae, but an increase in modification of empirical therapy.
TI  - Detection of pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses: evaluation of limulus amoebocyte lysate and in vitro pyrogen tests.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the ability of the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and the in vitro pyrogen test (IPT) to detect pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses (IOLs). SETTING: Berlin Eye Research Institute, Berlin, Germany. METHODS: Fifteen of each of the following IOLs were used: MicroSil MS 612 ASP, AcrySof SA60AT, Superflex, Sensar, XACT, and LS-106 IOLs. The challenge organism suspensions were 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(4) CFU/mL Escherichia coli, 10(3) CFU/mL and 10(4) CFU/mL Pseudomonas putida, and 10(5) CFU/mL and 10(6) CFU/mL Staphylococcus epidermidis. Two IOLs of each model were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 days in 0.6 mL of 1 of the suspensions. They were then gamma sterilized. The extract of 1 IOL was tested with the LAL assay; the other IOL was tested with the IPT. RESULTS: The LAL was negative for all incubated IOLs. The IPT was positive for all IOLs incubated in E coli and P putida suspensions, with the MicroSil MS 612 ASP, AcrySof SA60AT, XACT, and LS-106 IOLs showing a severe reaction. The Superflex and Sensar IOLs had a slight to moderate response for lower bacterial concentrations and a moderate to severe response for higher concentrations. For S epidermidis, all IOLs showed a slight IPT response except XACT IOLs, which showed a nonpyrogenic response. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the LAL test may fail to detect pyrogens adsorbed to IOLs and the IPT reliably detects pyrogens with a dose-dependent response. This has relevance in the investigation of toxic anterior segment syndrome outbreaks.
TI  - Sarcosaprophagous flies in Suez governorate, Egypt IV--persistence of human pathogenic bacteria in the developmental stages.
AB  - The persistence of three species of human pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli,  Shigella sonnei and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in sterile artificially fed larvae was examined till adult emergence after ingestion by three species of sarcosaprophagous flies (House fly, Musca domestica, Oriental latrine blow fly, Chrysomya megacephala and Australian cheep blow fly, Lucilia cuprina). The number of bacteria present in mature maggots, pupae and emerging adults declined significantly (P < 0.05). Each human pathogenic bacteria when introduced into a sterilized larval medium, was routinely recovered from larvae (10(5)), pupae (ranged from 10(3) to 10(4) and the majority of emerging flies retain 102 bacteria, whereas some are sterile. The potentiality of emerged flies to harbor bacteria is clearly different (M. domestica > C. megacephala > L. cuprina). No detection for S. epidermidis from emerged C. megacephala and L. cuprina flies, moreover S. sonnei was not detected in the emerged flies of L. cuprina.
TI  - At the crossroads of bacterial metabolism and virulence factor synthesis in Staphylococci.
AB  - Bacteria live in environments that are subject to rapid changes in the availability of the nutrients that are necessary to provide energy and biosynthetic intermediates for the synthesis of macromolecules. Consequently, bacterial survival depends on the ability of bacteria to regulate the expression of genes coding for enzymes required for growth in the altered environment. In pathogenic bacteria, adaptation to an altered environment often includes activating the transcription of virulence genes; hence, many virulence genes are regulated by environmental and nutritional signals. Consistent with this observation, the regulation of most, if not all, virulence determinants in staphylococci is mediated by environmental and nutritional signals. Some of these external signals can be directly transduced into a regulatory response by two-component regulators such as SrrAB; however, other external signals require transduction into intracellular signals. Many of the external environmental and nutritional signals that regulate virulence determinant expression can also alter bacterial metabolic status (e.g., iron limitation). Altering the metabolic status results in the transduction of external signals into intracellular metabolic signals that can be "sensed" by regulatory proteins (e.g., CodY, Rex, and GlnR). This review uses information derived primarily using Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli to articulate how gram-positive pathogens, with emphasis on Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, regulate virulence determinant expression in response to a changing environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of triclosan and DispersinB combination.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine: (i) synergy of the combination of triclosan and DispersinB (DspB); (ii) in vitro efficacy and durability of triclosan + DspB-coated vascular catheters; and (iii) in vivo efficacy of triclosan + DspB-coated catheters compared with chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CH-SS)-coated and uncoated (control) vascular catheters in preventing colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: We investigated the potential synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of triclosan and DspB by biofilm assays. The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of triclosan + DspB-coated catheters was determined by microbial colonization assays. Antimicrobial durability of the coated catheters was tested by soaking segments in bovine serum for 7 days and determining antimicrobial activity, and by a serial plate transfer method. The in vivo efficacy of triclosan + DspB-coated catheters compared with CH-SS-coated and uncoated catheters was assessed by subcutaneous implantation of segments in a rabbit model of S. aureus infection. RESULTS: The combination of triclosan and DspB showed synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, significantly reduced bacterial colonization (P < 0.05) and generally demonstrated a prolonged superior antimicrobial activity against clinical pathogens compared with CH-SS-coated catheters. Triclosan + DspB-coated and CH-SS-coated catheters exhibited equal in vivo efficacy (P <or= 0.05) in reducing colonization by S. aureus compared with uncoated catheters. CONCLUSIONS: Catheters coated with the triclosan + DspB combination showed synergistic, broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of catheters coated with this unique antimicrobial/antibiofilm composition prompts clinical evaluation of such an innovative approach.
TI  - Interventions for control of Salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance of bacterial contamination. Before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. Five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and Staphylococcus intermedius. In separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. Turbidity of the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. New rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (P < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. We improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. Two of the compounds were most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with Salmonella Enteritidis. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of Salmonella Enteritidis before and after treatment. The most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared Salmonella Enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.
TI  - Silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  - The colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective antibacterial and antifouling coatings. There is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. In this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. The release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. These silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.
TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - Neonatal cord blood subsets and cytokine response to bacterial antigens.
AB  - We compared lymphocyte subsets and cytokine responses to bacteria among term, preterm infants, and adults. Lymphocyte subset percentages in cord blood (22 preterm, 27 term neonates) and peripheral blood from 21 adults and cytokine/chemokine interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon gamma (IFN gamma) responses to Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp299v) were assessed by flow cytometry. Preterm compared with term infants had increased CD8 (+) T cells (p = 0.02) and reduced naive CD4 (+) T cells (p < 0.0001). Memory T and natural killer (NK) T cells were reduced (p < 0.001) in neonates; NK and CD56 (+)161 (+) NK cells were increased (p < 0.001). CD56 (+)CD8 (+) NK cells were higher in preterm compared with term infants. Despite individual exceptions, cytokine responses in neonates were weaker than adults except for IL-8 response to E. coli in preterm and IL-12 response to Lp299v in term infants. IL-10 responses were weaker in preterm (p = 0.01) and term (p = 0.005) infants to S. epidermidis and to E. coli (p = 0.03 for both) compared with adults. Differences in regulatory subpopulations of NK and T cells between neonates and adults and term compared with preterm infants were observed. These differences rather than intrinsic functional deficiency may account for neonatal cytokine responses to bacteria.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from Chaerophyllum aureum L. (Apiaceae).
AB  - The essential oils of the aerial parts and fruits of Chaerophyllum aureum L., collected from two mountains in Serbia, were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Sabinene (18.5-31.6%), p-cymene (7.9-25.4%) and limonene (1.9-10.9%) were characterized as the main constituents. The oils were tested against six bacterial strains and one strain of yeast, Candida albicans. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus, while of the Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli was the most sensitive.
TI  - Copper(II) and uranyl(II) complexes with acylthiosemicarbazide: synthesis, characterization, antibacterial activity and effects on the growth of promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60.
AB  - New chelates of N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-butyl-thiosemicarbazide (X=H, Cl, Br) with Cu(2+) and UO(2)(2+) have been prepared and characterized by analytical and physico-chemical techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, elemental and thermal analyses, electronic, ESR and IR spectral studies. Room temperature ESR spectra of Cu(II) complexes yield {g} values characteristic of distorted octahedral and pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. Infrared spectra indicate that complexes contain six-coordinate uranium atom with the ligand atoms arranged in an equatorial plane around the linear uranyl group. Effects of these complexes on the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60 and their antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 strains) were studied comparatively with that of free ligands.
TI  - A new central venous catheter cap: decreased microbial growth and risk for catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is a source of significant healthcare expenditures in patients that require central venous catheters for intravenous nutrition, chemotherapy, and other products. The source of many catheter-related infections is contamination of the catheter hub. Herein an antimicrobial catheter cap, the AB Cap is described. METHODS: The AB Cap device is a catheter cleaning device designed to keep needleless luer valves clean by encapsulating them in a cleaning solution. This device was evaluated using an in vitro model of hub contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans (C. albicans). Following hub contamination on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, saline was infused through the AB Cap and effluent collected from the efferent end. The effluent fluid was cultured for the index organisms, and allowed to incubate in culture for up to 7 days. Negative control caps were not contaminated and positive controls lacked cleaning solution and were contaminated. RESULTS: Microbial growth developed for all index organisms, and generally within 1 day of culture growth following the first day of contamination (day 1) in effluent from all positive controls, while no growth occurred in effluent from negative controls. No growth of any organism occurred in any of the test items after the first day of contamination. Growth of three organisms was detected in two of the three test AB Caps following contamination day 3, after 1-4 days of incubation. All organisms could be cultured in the effluent from two of the three test items at contamination day 5, generally by the second day of incubation. One test item remained free of growth for the entire test period except for one organism. By day 7, this particular test item grew an additional organism and the testing was concluded. All positive growth test items remained positive on subsequent inoculations during culture of newly obtained effluent with the exception of test item A, from which effluent following inoculation on day 3 showed growth of S. epidermidis and K. pneumonia, but no growth for these organisms from effluent obtained on inoculation day 5. In addition, effluent from test item C showed growth of C. albicans from inoculation day 5, but no growth from effluent obtained on inoculation day 7. The growth of S. epidermidis from effluent of test item A from the day 3 inoculation, and C. albicans from effluent of test items B and C did not occur until day 4 of incubation, suggesting a very small amount of contamination. CONCLUSION: An antimicrobial catheter cap is not a complete substitute for a proper catheter cleaning technique and other anti-infection precautions. However, we describe a unique catheter cap that significantly decreased the likelihood of a catheter-related infection from a non-cleaned cap in an in vitro model.
TI  - Neonatal blood cultures: effect of delayed entry into the blood culture machine and bacterial concentration on the time to positive growth in a simulated model.
AB  - AIMS: To determine if: time from blood culture inoculation to positive growth (total time to positive) and time from blood culture machine entry to positive growth (machine time to positive) is altered by delayed entry into the automated blood culture machine, and if the total time to positive differs by the concentration of organisms inoculated into blood culture bottles. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci were chosen as clinically significant representative organisms. Two concentrations (> or =10 colony-forming units per millilitre and <1 colony-forming units per millilitre) were inoculated into PEDS BacT/Alert blood culture bottles and randomly allocated to one of three delayed automated blood culture machine entry times (30 min/8.5 h/15.5 h). RESULTS: For all organisms at all concentrations, except the Staphylococcus epidermidis, the machine time to positive was significantly decreased by delayed entry. For all organisms at all concentrations, the mean total time to positive significantly increased with increasing delayed entry into the blood culture machine. Higher concentrations of group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli grew significantly faster than lower concentrations. CONCLUSION: Bacterial growth in inoculated bottles, stored at room temperature, continues although at a slower rate than in those blood culture bottles immediately entered into the machine. If a blood culture specimen has been stored at room temperature for greater than 15.5 h, the currently allowed safety margin of 36 h (before declaring a result negative) may be insufficient.
TI  - Polyelectrolyte multilayers with intrinsic antimicrobial functionality: the importance of mobile polycations.
AB  - Cationic contact-killing is an important strategy for creating antimicrobial surfaces that prevent viable bacteria attachment. Recent studies have shown that highly swollen, compliant surfaces resist bacterial attachment and a sufficient density of mobile cationic charge can effectively disrupt bacterial cell membranes. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), a popular coating system for surface modification, have been used to kill bacteria through the incorporation of contact-killing or leaching biocides. In this work, we show that manipulation of multilayer assembly and postassembly conditions (e.g., pH) to expose mobile cationic charge can create antimicrobial PEMs without the addition of specific biocidal species. As a model system, we explored PEMs comprising poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (SPS) assembled at high pH and subsequently immersed in low pH solutions. This system undergoes a reversible pH-dependent swelling transition, and we demonstrate that antimicrobial functionality at physiological pH conditions can be turned on and off with suitable pH treatment. In both airborne and waterborne bacteria assays, the viability of two strains of Gram positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), one biofilm forming and one nonbiofilm forming, and two strains of Gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) was effectively reduced on SPS/PAH multilayers displaying accessible cationic charge. To generalize our results, the pH assembly conditions of PEMs comprising poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and PAH were also modified to introduce antibacterial capabilities.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - An antimicrobial modified silicone peritoneal catheter with activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Peritonitis, exit site and tunnel infections are serious complications of peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which may lead to catheter loss, despite measures taken to reduce the infection rate. Catheters coated with antimicrobials have shown only short-term activity. We have developed a process for conferring broad-spectrum, long-duration antimicrobial activity on CAPD catheters while reducing the risk of resistance. Catheters were processed using an impregnation method. Three agents were used: rifampicin, triclosan and trimethoprim. Tests included establishing the duration of activity before test bacteria became resistant, the ability to kill 100% of attached bacteria in a predetermined time (tK100), and ability to withstand multiple high-count challenges until failure in a flow model. Antimicrobial activity continued until it was stopped at 280 days and the agents prevented the emergence of resistant strains. tK100 results showed a >99.9% reduction of attached bacteria. The flow model showed no colonization when repeatedly challenged with high loads of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli for approximately 90 days. The antimicrobial catheter material showed prolonged activity against common CAPD pathogens and promises to reduce clinical CAPD infection.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  - Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. Even though the definition of UTI is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has been unclear if the quantity of cultured UTI bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. We studied patients diagnosed as having complicated UTIs at the Urological Department in Kobe University Hospital between June 2002 and March 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial MICs for antibiotics. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial MICs in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. In conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in urine culture did not determine the MICs and that inoculum of the bacteria might be important for this determination.
TI  - [Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica].
AB  - Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica. Unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in Costa Rica and other Neotropical countries. It has been used in the topic treatment of infected wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria. We studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. The analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of Clostridium botulinum. The antimicrobial effect was tested for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger (Asni 06). Most of the samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 CFU/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 CFU/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher than 10(2) CFU/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; C. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. No inhibitory effect was observed for A. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Anti-biofilm efficacy of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles.
AB  - The ability of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing silica nanoparticles to kill biofilm-based microbial cells is reported. Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans were formed in vitro and exposed to NO-releasing silica nanoparticles. Replicative viability experiments revealed that >or= 99% of cells from each type of biofilm were killed via NO release, with the greatest efficacy (>or= 99.999% killing) against gram-negative P. aeruginosa and E. coli biofilms. Cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that the highest dose of NO-releasing silica nanoparticles inhibited fibroblast proliferation to a lesser extent than clinical concentrations of currently administered antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine) with proven wound-healing benefits. This study demonstrates the promise of employing nanoparticles for delivering an antimicrobial agent to microbial biofilms.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity evaluation of metronidazole-triazole conjugates.
AB  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of metronidazole-triazole conjugates are reported. Total 21 hybrid compounds have been synthesized with different substitution pattern on the triazole ring in order to study their influence on the antibacterial activity. These compounds demonstrated potent to weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria. Six compounds have shown equal or better antibacterial activity against Gram-negative strains than the reference compound.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Synthesis of citrate-ciprofloxacin conjugates.
AB  - Two regioisomeric citrate-functionalized ciprofloxacin conjugates have been synthesized and their antimicrobial activities against a panel of clinically-relevant bacteria have been determined. Cellular uptake mechanisms were investigated using wild-type and ompF deletion strains of Escherichia coli K-12.
TI  - [Role of some species of Ficus in amelioration of environment].
AB  - Laboratory investigation of gas-absorbing and antimicrobial (phytoncide) activity of Ficus species was carried out. It was demonstrated that some species of Ficus genus possessing gas-absorbing and phytoncide properties can be used to improve the sanitary characteristics of indoor air. The highest ability to absorb formaldehyde were exhibited by F. benjamina, F. retusa, F. binnendijkii, F. lyrata. The phytoncide action was revealed for all the investigated Ficus species against Escherichia coli, while only F. benjamina was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis. No activity against yeastlike fungi Candida albicans was revealed.
TI  - Comparative assessment of antimicrobial activities of antibiotic-treated penile prostheses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections associated with penile implants are relatively infrequent, they result in serious medical consequences. Because treatment of these infections usually requires removal of the infected penile implant, prevention of infection is crucial. Since bacterial colonization of the implant is a prelude to clinical infection, antimicrobial modification of the devices may inhibit device colonization and subsequent infection. OBJECTIVE: We compared the spectrum and durability, both in vitro and in vivo, of two antibiotic-treated penile prostheses: InhibiZone implants pre-impregnated with minocycline and rifampin (M/R) and Titan implants dipped in vancomycin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 1x1-cm cylinder segments of (1) control untreated, (2) M/R-impregnated, and (3) vancomycin-dipped implants were studied. Baseline zones of inhibition (ZI) were determined against clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Escherichia coli. In addition, ZI against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were compared both in vitro after being washed in a flow chamber and after subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 1, 2, 7, and 14 d. MEASUREMENTS: ZI were measured as the diameter of the clear zone around each test device minus the external diameter of the device. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Implants pre-impregnated with M/R displayed a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity than vancomycin-dipped implants against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The M/R-impregnated devices also yielded significantly larger zones of inhibition against S. aureus than vancomycin-dipped implants, both in vitro (p<0.003) and in vivo throughout the 14-d period of device implantation in rabbits (p</=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Penile prostheses impregnated with M/R have a broader spectrum in vitro and a more durable antimicrobial activity in vitro and in an animal model than implants dipped in vancomycin. Therefore, along with being a more practical model for incorporating antimicrobials onto the device, the use of implants pre-impregnated with M/R may help reduce the incidence of penile implant infection.
TI  - Anti-infectious activity of tryptophan metabolites in the L-tryptophan-L-kynurenine pathway.
AB  - To study the anti-infectious effect of a vascular allograft, the antimicrobial activity of tryptophan metabolites mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was determined. The growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over 10 h in extracts from post-transplantation vascular allograft was significantly slower than that of extracts from non-transplantation vascular allograft regardless of the presence of tryptophan (p<0.05). When the antimicrobial activity of the tryptophan metabolites in the L-tryptophan-L-kynurenine pathway was examined, 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid had strong antibacterial activity against MRSA, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although antimicrobial activities of anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid against them were low. The results showed that, of the tested tryptophan metabolites, 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid contributed to the anti-infectious effects of the allograft by inhibiting of the growth of microorganisms.
TI  - Antitumour and antimicrobial activities of endophytic streptomycetes from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to screen antitumour and antimicrobial activities of endophytic actinomycetes isolated from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest in Yunnan province, China. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antitumour activity was studied by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and antimicrobial activity was determined by agar well diffusion method. The high bioactive endophytic isolates were identified and further investigated for the presence of polyketide synthases (PKS-I, PKS-II) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) sequences by specific amplification. The molecular identification confirmed that the 41 isolates showed significant activities were members of the genus Streptomyces. Among them, 31.7% of endophytic streptomycete cultures were cytotoxic against A549 cells, 29.3% against HL-60 cells, 85.4% against BEL-7404 cells, 90.2% against P388D1 cells, 65.9% were active against Escherichia coli, 24.4% against Staphylococcus aureus, 31.7% against Staphylococcus epidermidis, 12.2% against Candida albicans and no strain displayed antagonistic activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. High frequencies of positive PCR amplification were obtained for PKS-I (34.1%), PKS-II (63.4%) and NRPS (61.0%) biosynthetic systems. CONCLUSIONS: Many endophytic streptomycetes isolated from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest possess remarkable and diverse antitumour and antimicrobial bioactivities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These endophytic streptomycetes are precious resources obtained from rainforests, and they could be a promising source for bioactive agents.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis Biofilms: Functional Molecules, Relation to Virulence, and Vaccine Potential.
AB  - Medical device-associated infections, most frequently caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, are of increasing importance in modern medicine. The formation of adherent, multilayered bacterial biofilms is crucial in the pathogenesis of these infections. Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), a homoglycan of beta-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D: -glucopyranosyl residues, of which about 15% are non-N-acetylated, is central to biofilm accumulation in staphylococci. It transpires that polysaccharides - structurally very similar to PIA - are also key to biofilm formation in a number of other organisms including the important human pathogens Escherichia coli, Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Yersinia pestis, and Bordetella spp. Apparently, synthesis of PIA and related polysaccharides is a general feature important for biofilm formation in diverse bacterial genera. Current knowledge about the structure and biosynthesis of PIA and related polysaccharides is reviewed. Additionally, information on their role in pathogenesis of biomaterial-related and other type of infections and the potential use of PIA and related compounds for prevention of infection is evaluated.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  - The fruit of Lonicera caerulea L. (blue honeysuckle; Caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. The phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% H3PO4 and SPE using Sepabeads SP207. The sugar and lipid content was analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. The total content of anthocyanins was determined using the pH differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. MicroLC-MS/MS was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside, epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. The phenolic fraction displayed Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and DPPH and superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (IC50 160 +/- 20 microg/mL). The freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - In vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  - Camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. Green tea extract-4 (CSI-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. It showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL. CSI-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the IC(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/mL. It exhibited the highest activity against P. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CSI-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of gallbladder bile in uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed microflora and their antibiotic sensitivity in normal bile and lithogenic bile with different types of gallstones. METHODS: We performed a case control study of 70 bile samples (35 cholesterol and 35 pigment stones from 51 females and 19 males, aged 21-72 years with a median age of 37 years) from patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis, and 20 controls (14 females and 6 males, aged 33-70 years with a median age of 38 years) who underwent laparotomy and had no gallbladder stone shown by ultrasound scan. The bile samples were aerobically cultured to assess microflora and their antibiotic susceptibility. The procedures were undertaken under sterile conditions. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (54%) of the 70 patients with gallstones had bacterial isolates. Nine isolates (26%) were from cholesterol stone-containing bile and 29 isolates (82%) from pigment stone-containing bile (P=0.01, t test). Twenty-eight of these 38 (74%) bile samples were shown positive only after enrichment in brain heart infusion medium (BHI) (P=0.02, t test). The overall bacterial isolates from bile samples revealed E. coli predominantly, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella spp. and S. epidermidis. There were no bacterial isolates in the bile of controls after either direct inoculation or enrichment in BHI. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial isolates were found in pigment stone-containing bile. Non-lithogenic bile revealed no bacteria, showing an association between gallstone formation and the presence of bacteria in bile. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of isolated organisms were similar irrespective of the type of stone.
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - [Antagonistic properties of enterococci isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers].
AB  - The strains with antagonistic activity against indicator strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella enterica were revealed among 58 Enterococcus strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers. The influence of different components of MRS medium on the antagonistic effect was established. Antagonistic activity remained on the medium without glucose in 36% of strains, on the medium without tween 80--in 60% of strains, on the medium without sodium acetate and ammonium citric acid--in 65% of strains. The activity both for the lack of K2HPO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4, and in the absence of complex nitrogen sources (peptone, beef extract, yeast extract and hepatic extract) was shown in 76% of strains.
TI  - Four anti-protozoal and anti-bacterial compounds from Tapirira guianensis.
AB  - Tapirira guianensis is a common tree used in traditional medicine in French Guiana against several infectious diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis, bacteria, etc.). The bioassay-guided purification of CH(2)Cl(2) bark extract led to the isolation of four cyclic alkyl polyol derivatives: 4,6,2'-trihydroxy-6-[10'(Z)-heptadecenyl]-1-cyclohexen-2-one (1a), 1,4,6-trihydroxy-1,2'-epoxy-6-[10'(Z)-heptadecenyl]-2-cyclohexene (1b), 1,4,5,2'-tetrahydroxy-1-[10'(Z)-heptadecenyl]-2-cyclohexene (2), and 1,3,4,6-tetrahydroxy-1,2'-epoxy-6-[10'(Z)-heptadecenyl]-cyclohexane (3). The structures were established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR analyses. The anti-leishmanial, anti-plasmodial, anti-bacterial (on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli), and anti-fungal (on Candida albicans) activities of the extracts and of these original compounds were evaluated. Two showed medicinal interest supporting the traditional uses of the plant. The structures were established through spectral analyses of the isolates and their derivatives.
TI  - Innovative antimicrobial susceptibility testing method using surface plasmon resonance.
AB  - Utilizing the ultra sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor to examine drug resistance of bacteria was studied in this research. Susceptible and resistant strains of Escherichia coli JM109 to ampicillin and those of Staphylococcus epidermidis to tetracycline, served as a blind test, were examined. The bacteria adhered on the Au thin film was treated by the injection of antibiotic flow. The optical property change of the bacteria responded to antibiotics were recorded through SPR mechanism. As a result, the susceptible strain of E. coli generally revealed more than three times of SPR angle shift when compared to the resistant one; the susceptible strain of S. epidermidis revealed irregular SPR angle shift while the resistant strain kept the SPR angle almost unchanged. The new SPR method took less than 2h of antibiotic treatment time to complete the antimicrobial susceptibility test. Different from conventional applications of SPR, specific antibodies is not required in this method. As compared to the conventional assays, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and variations of broth microdilution usually take 1 day to weeks to issue the report. Using this SPR assay can greatly reduce the waiting period for laboratory tests, and can therefore benefit patients who need proper antibiotic treatments to control bacterial infections. The sensitivity of the SPR biosensor built for the application is around 1.4 x 10(-4) on the refractive index.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - Enumeration of Mycobacterium leprae using real-time PCR.
AB  - Mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited sensitivity and specificity. We have developed a real-time PCR assay for quantifying M. leprae DNA in biological samples. Primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (RLEP) specific to M. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the TaqMan format. The assay was specific for M. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified M. leprae DNA, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. We used the RLEP TaqMan PCR to assess the short and long-term growth results of M. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of M. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. We found excellent correlative results between estimates from RLEP TaqMan PCR and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). The RLEP TaqMan PCR permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. Molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of M. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - The inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation by vancomycin-modified titanium alloy and implications for the treatment of periprosthetic infection.
AB  - Peri-prosthetic infections are notoriously difficult to treat as the biomaterial  implant is ideal for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, resulting in decreased antibiotic sensitivity. Previously, we reported that vancomycin covalently attached to a Ti alloy surface (Vanc-Ti) could prevent bacterial colonization. Herein we examine the effect of this Vanc-Ti surface on Staphylococci epidermidis, a Gram-positive organism prevalent in orthopaedic infections. By direct colony counting and fluorescent visualization of live bacteria, S. epidermidis colonization was significantly inhibited on Vanc-Ti implants. In contrast, the gram-negative organism Escherichia coli readily colonized the Vanc-Ti rod, suggesting retention of antibiotic specificity. By histochemical and SEM analysis, Vanc-Ti prevented S. epidermidis biofilm formation, even in the presence of serum. Furthermore, when challenged multiple times with S. epidermidis, Vanc-Ti rods resisted bacterial colonization. Finally, when S. epidermidis was continuously cultured in the presence of Vanc-Ti, the bacteria maintained a Vanc sensitivity equivalent to the parent strain. These findings indicate that antibiotic derivatization of implants can result in a surface that can resist bacterial colonization. This technology holds great promise for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic infections.
TI  - Lytic activity of the recombinant staphylococcal bacteriophage PhiH5 endolysin active against Staphylococcus aureus in milk.
AB  - The endolysin gene (lysH5) from the genome of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage PhiH5 was cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized. The lysH5 gene encoded a protein (LysH5) whose calculated molecular mass and pI were 53.7 kDa and 8.7, respectively. Comparative analysis revealed that LysH5 significantly resembled other murein hydrolases encoded by staphylococcal phages. The modular organization of LysH5 comprised three putative domains, namely, CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase), amidase (L-muramoyl-L-alanine amidase), and SH3b (cell wall recognition). In turbidity reduction assays, the purified protein lysed bovine and human S. aureus, and human Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Other bacteria belonging to different genera were not affected. The lytic activity was optimal at pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, and sensitive to high temperatures. The purified protein was able to kill rapidly S. aureus growing in pasteurized milk and the pathogen was not detected after 4 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. As far as we know, this is the first report to assess the antimicrobial activity of a phage endolysin which might be useful for novel biocontrol strategies in dairying.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Homologous and heterologous expression and maturation processing of extracellular glutamyl endopeptidase of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The extracellular serine endopeptidase GluSE (EC 3.4.21.19) is considered to be one of the virulence factors of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The present study investigated maturation processing of native GluSE and that heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. In addition to the 28-kDa mature protease, small amounts of proenzymes with molecular masses of 32, 30, and 29 kDa were identified in the extracellular and cell wall-associated fractions. We defined the pre (M1-A27)- and pro (K28-S66)-segments, and found that processing at the E32-S33 and D48-I49 bonds was responsible for production of the 30- and 29-kDa intermediates, respectively. The full-length form of C-terminally His-tagged GluSE was purified as three proenzymes equivalent to the native ones. These molecules possessing an entire or a part of the pro-segment were proteolytically latent and converted to a mature 28-kDa form by thermolysin cleavage at the S66-V67 bond. Mutation of the essential amino acid S235 suggested auto-proteolytic production of the 30- and 29-kDa intermediates. Furthermore, an undecapeptide (I56-S66) of the truncated pro-segment not only functions as an inhibitor of the protease but also facilitates thermolysin processing. These findings could offer clues to the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of proteolytic activity of pathogenic proteases secreted from S. epidermidis.
TI  - Hybrid molecules between benzenesulfonamides and active antimicrobial benzo[d]isothiazol-3-ones.
AB  - Novel hybrid molecules between benzenesulfonamides and active antimicrobial 2-amino-benzo[d]isothiazol-3-ones were synthesized and characterised and their in vitro antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The compounds exhibit moderate antibacterial properties against gram-positive bacteria (MIC 6-100 microg ml(-1)) such as several bacilli, staphylococci and streptococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, while no inhibition of gram-negative Escherichia coli is detected up to the concentration of 100 microg ml(-1). Synergistic inhibitory activity occurs when sulfanilamides 4a and 4c are tested in combination with trimethoprim against S. aureus. Concerning antifungal properties, only compound 4c is able to inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans yeasts and several dermatophytes. Structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - The in vitro anti-pathogenic activity of immunoglobulin concentrates extracted from ovine blood.
AB  - An immunoglobulin-rich fraction has been prepared from ovine blood in our laboratory. We have investigated its antibacterial activity and binding activity to pathogenic whole cell antigens, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Ovine immunoglobulin concentrate (OIC) comprised about 73 +/- 2% of IgG and 11 +/- 1% of IgM on a protein basis. It inhibited the growth of all 13 strains of pathogens tested, but the inhibitory activity varied according to bacterial strain. The inhibitory activity of OIC was attributed to the high contents of undenatured immunoglobulin present because its inhibitory activity was destroyed by pepsin digestion and heat treatment (65 degrees C for 30 min). OIC bound to all the Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, regardless of cell wall structure. The highest magnitude of crossreactivity to whole cell antigens was against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Shigella soneii strains (p < 0.001). The binding activity of OIC to LPS obtained from Escherichia coli O111:B4 and Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lymphoblast K-562 proliferation assay. OIC bound to LPS with a binding activity that was dependent on OIC concentration and saturable, showing typical hyperbolic curves. For toxin-binding activity, an OIC concentration-dependent trend like that for LPS-binding activity was also observed. This preliminary evidence suggests that the OIC used in this study could be a promising supplement for protecting against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Study on antibacterial effect of 45S5 Bioglass.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that bioactive glasses possessed antibacterial effect on common bacteria due to the high aqueous pH value caused by the bioactive glass dissolution. In the present study, the efficiency of the antibacterial effect of 45S5 Bioglass (45S5 BAG) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli and its mechanism were investigated. The results showed that 45S5 BAG exhibited a strong antibacterial effect against the bacteria, and the sensitivity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to Bioglass was different. Furthermore, a dose-dependent bacterial adhesion on 45S5 BAG particles and the formation of needle-like Bioglass debris were observed, which resulted in the damage of cell walls and inactivation of bacteria. The results suggested that both the high pH and bioglass debris on the surface of bacteria may be the possible mechanisms of the antibacterial effect of 45S5 BAG particulates.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Bacterial DNA sample preparation from whole blood using surface-modified Si pillar arrays.
AB  - A novel bacterial DNA sample preparation device for molecular diagnostics has been developed. On the basis of optimized conditions for bacterial adhesion, surface-modified silicon pillar arrays for bacterial cell capture were fabricated, and their ability to capture bacterial cells was demonstrated. The capture efficiency for bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans in buffer solution was over 75% with a flow rate of 400 microL/min. Moreover, the proposed method captured E. coli cells present in 50% whole blood effectively. The captured cells from whole blood were then in- situ lyzed on the surface of the microchip, and the eluted DNA was successfully amplified by qPCR. These results demonstrate that the full process of pathogen capture to DNA isolation from whole blood could be automated in a single microchip.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of oxidized cellulose salts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of oxidized cellulose and its salts in linters (-L) and  microsphere (-M) form (OKCEL H-L, OKCEL Zn-M, OKCEL ZnNa-L, OKCEL ZnNa-M and OKCEL Ag-L) were tested by a dilution method against a spectrum of microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. OKCEL Ag-L exhibited antimicrobial activity in the range 0.1-3.5% w/v against all the bacteria and fungi involved in this study. Strong inhibition by OKCEL ZnNa-M was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis in the range 0.5-2.0% w/v. Antimicrobial effects of oxidized cellulose and its salts in textile form were investigated by a diffusion and dilution method against the spectrum of above-cited microbial strains extended by Clostridium perfringens. Generally, OKCEL Ag-T, OKCEL Zn-T and OKCEL H-T showed high antimicrobial activity against populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. OKCEL Zn-T was the only sample suppressing the growth of species.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant AAC6'-APH2'' enzyme.
AB  - Vertilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside with a structure similar to that of netilmicin except for a methyl group at the C-6' position. In the present study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin was studied, and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aminoglycoside bifunctional modifying enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2'') was compared with those of verdamicin and netilmicin. A total of 1,185 clinical isolates collected from hospitals in Beijing between 2000 and 2001 were subjected to the in vitro antibacterial activity evaluations, including MIC, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and time-kill curve tests. The MICs were evaluated in non-gentamicin-resistant (gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-intermediate) strains and gentamicin-resistant strains, respectively. For most of the non-gentamicin-resistant bacteria (except for the isolates of Pseudomonas spp.), the MIC(90)s of vertilmicin were in the range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, comparable to those of the reference aminoglycosides. For the gentamicin-resistant isolates, the three semisynthetic aminoglycosides (vertilmicin, netilmicin, and amikacin) demonstrated low MIC(50)s and/or MIC(90)s, as well as high percent susceptibility values. Among the study drugs, vertilmicin showed the lowest MIC(90)s, 16 microg/ml, for the gram-positive gentamicin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Meanwhile, vertilmicin was a potent bactericidal agent, with MBC/MIC ratios in the range of 1 to 2 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus and 1 to 4 for S. epidermidis. The time-kill curve determination further demonstrated that this effect was rapid and concentration dependent. In evaluations of susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant AAC(6')-APH(2'') with maximum rate of metabolism/K(m) measurements, vertilmicin exhibited susceptibilities to both acetylation and phosphorylation lower than those of netilmicin and verdamicin.
TI  - Silver nanorod arrays as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate for foodborne pathogenic bacteria detection.
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using novel silver nanorod array substrates has been used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. The substrate consists of a base layer of 500 nm silver film on a glass slide and a layer of silver nanorod array with a length of approximately 1 microm produced by the oblique angle deposition method at a vapor incident angle of 86 degrees . Spectra from whole cell bacteria, Generic Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, E. coli DH 5alpha, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella typhimurium, and bacteria mixtures have been obtained. This SERS active substrate can detect spectral differences between Gram types, different species, their mixture, and strains. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to classify the spectra. Viable and nonviable cells have also been examined, and significantly reduced SERS responses were observed for nonviable cells. SERS detection of bacteria at the single cell level, excited at low incident laser power (12 micro W) and short collection time (10 s), has also been demonstrated. These results indicate that the SERS-active silver nanorod array substrate is a potential analytical sensor for rapid identification of microorganisms with a minimum of sample preparation.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro antibacterial efficacy of PDS plus (polidioxanone with triclosan) suture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the efficacy of polydioxanone suture with and without triclosan against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Polydioxanone suture with and without triclosan was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli by a zone of inhibition assay. In vivo evaluations were conducted in guinea pigs and mice in which test and control sutures (3-4 cm long) were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal-lateral regions (control on left, test on right, 3-5 cm apart) through a 20 gauge catheter. Each implantation site was then challenged directly through the catheter with 4 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) of S. aureus (guinea pigs) or 7 x 10(6) CFU of E. coli (mice). At 48 h post-implantation, the control and test sutures were explanted, and adherent bacteria were counted. RESULTS: Polydioxanone suture with triclosan demonstrated activity against all test organisms in vitro. The antibacterial activity was maintained until the sutures dissolved after 17 to 23 days when tested against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Evaluation in animal models demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in S. aureus and a 90% reduction in E. coli relative to controls. CONCLUSION: Polydioxanone suture with triclosan had activity in vitro against S. aureus, MRSA, E. coli, S. epidermidis, MRSE, and K. pneumoniae that persisted for as long as three weeks. In animal models, polydioxanone suture with triclosan inhibited in vivo colonization by S. aureus and E. coli.
TI  - Surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. The antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (DCT), agar diffusion test (ADT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion. Samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains tested. Reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of S. aureus and E. faecalis, and decreased growth of S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (p<0.0001). The DCT results were confirmed by SEM. However, ADT showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. Biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. Incorporation of PEI nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on biocompatibility.
TI  - Monitoring the physiologic stress response: a novel biophysical approach for the  rapid detection of bacteria in platelet concentrate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrates (PCs) require an extended period of time to obtain results. A new approach based on the monitoring of the bacterial response to physiologic stress is presented. Because the stress response is independent of the growth rate, decisive results can be obtained in near real time. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PCs were spiked with Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli organisms commonly implicated in posttransfusion septic reactions. All suspensions were treated with Triton X-100 at concentrations that caused human cell lysis while acting as a stressor for bacterial cells. Normalized impedance response (NIR) profiles of these suspensions were recorded using the BioSense Technologies differential impedance sensing platform specifically designed to monitor subtle changes in the dielectric properties of biologic suspensions. Further development of the approach included measurement of NIRs for spiked PCs treated with nonlysing chemical stressors. RESULTS: NIR profiles for bacteria conventionally growing under optimal conditions were characterized by an overall increase in the NIR values. In contrast, the corresponding responses from chemically stressed bacteria revealed immediate and continuous decreases in value-enabling bacterial detection in less than 30 minutes. CONCLUSION: These pilot experiments demonstrated that monitoring of the bacterial stress response is a fast and effective way to detect bacteria in PCs. In addition, special culture conditions are not required for detecting anaerobes and fastidious species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Reduced bacterial adhesion to fibrinogen-coated substrates via nitric oxide release.
AB  - The ability of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing xerogels to reduce fibrinogen-mediated adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli is described. A negative correlation was observed between NO surface flux and bacterial adhesion for each species tested. For S. aureus and E. coli, reduced adhesion correlated directly with NO flux from 0 to 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1). A similar dependence for S. epidermidis was evident from 18 to 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1). At a NO flux of 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1), surface coverage of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. coli was reduced by 96, 48, and 88%, respectively, compared to non-NO-releasing controls. Polymeric NO release was thus demonstrated to be an effective approach for significantly reducing fibrinogen-mediated adhesion of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro, thereby illustrating the advantage of active NO release as a strategy for inhibiting bacterial adhesion in the presence of pre-adsorbed protein.
TI  - Effectiveness of a 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate locking solution in preventing biofilm formation by organisms causing haemodialysis catheter-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic locks may be used to prevent haemodialysis catheter-related infections (CRIs). This in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution in preventing biofilm formation by the most common pathogens causing haemodialysis CRIs. METHODS: Ten clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were tested. Bacterial suspensions of each isolate were prepared in a control solution of normal saline/Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and in a lock solution of 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate and MHB. The bacterial suspensions were placed into the wells of a Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) and incubated with fresh solution every 24 h for 72 h. The biofilm formation was assessed by removing the CBD pegs, placing them in normal saline and sonicating them for 5 min. The resulting solution was sampled and the colony counts were determined after 24 h of incubation. RESULTS: All controls demonstrated biofilm growth of between 6 x 10(6) and 7.4 x 10(7) cfu/mL over 72 h. In the 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution, no biofilm growth was observed after 72 h of incubation. These results were consistent among duplicates of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution prevented the biofilm formation of all isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in vitro. Further studies are necessary to determine its efficacy and safety in the haemodialysis population.
TI  - Synthesis and in-vitro antibacterial activity of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazoles.
AB  - A series of 5-substituted 1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in-vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Helicobacter pylori using conventional agar dilution method. Among the test compounds, 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-imidazole was the most potent against Gram-positive bacteria, with a MIC value of < or =8 microg/mL. All compounds showed no significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria at concentrations < or =64 microg/mL. The MIC values against 15 clinical isolates of H. pylori indicated that compounds 10 and 11 were the most active compounds in this series in terms of inhibiting the growth of H. pylori (MIC = 2 microg/mL). It was also demonstrated that their corresponding activities were four times larger than that of metronidazole.
TI  - An Escherichia coli expression system for glutamyl endopeptidases optimized by complete suppression of autodegradation.
AB  - V8 protease (GluV8), a member of the glutamyl endopeptidase I family isolated from the V8 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, is widely used for proteome analysis because of its unique substrate specificity and resistance to detergents. We recently developed an Escherichia coli expression system for the production of GluV8 based on a technique that suppresses the autoproteolysis--the use of the prosequence of its homologue (GluSE) from Staphylococcus epidermidis as a chimeric form or the introduction of four substitutions in the prosequence of GluV8. In the current study, we refined this technique through five amino acid substitutions within the prosequence of GluV8 for complete suppression of the autodegradation. As a result, the recovery of GluV8 proform was enhanced to 20 fg/cell, which was comparable to the level of a constitutive inactive form of GluV8, indicating complete suppression of the autoproteolysis. This mutated propeptide was also effective for the expression of the mature sequence of the glutamyl endopeptidase from Staphylococcus warneri. The recombinant proteins were successfully converted to their active forms through a common cleavage mechanism mediated by thermolysin in vitro. This strategy may shed light on the way for the expression of the proteases that have been scarcely produced in E. coli to date.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-MRSA cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase III clinical development. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram-negative bacilli including AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. In single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for AmpC beta-lactamases.Ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30 minutes. Peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/mL for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/mL for a 750-mg dose. The volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 L/kg ( approximately 18 L), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. Ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 0.5 hours for MRSA and a longer PAE of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f T(>MIC) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole MIC < or =4 and < or =2 mg/L, respectively.Currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. In a phase III trial, 784 patients with Gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for MRSA infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared with 90% for vancomycin. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. No difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. Microbiologic eradication of Gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) [ceftobiprole 91% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and MRSA (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and P. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. Similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MSSA and PVL-positive MRSA.Currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven MRSA; phase III trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. The broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to confirm further the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) in Europe. Men with a history of CBP were enrolled in a prospective, multinational (eight countries), open-label study to receive levofloxacin 500 mg once daily per os (p.o.) for 28 days. Patients were followed for 6 months. A total of 117 patients were treated. Gram-negative bacteria were identified in 57/106 patients (mainly Escherichia coli (n=37)) and Gram-positive bacteria in 60/106 patients (mainly Enterococcus faecalis (n=18) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=14)). Among the intention-to-treat population (n=116), the clinical success rate (cured and improved patients) was 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.8-96.5%), 77.4% (95% CI 68.2-84.9%), 66.0% (95% CI 56.2-75.0%) and 61.9% (95% CI 51.9-71.2%) at 5-12 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment. The microbiological eradication rate according to evaluation scheme II was 82/98 (83.7%, 95% CI 74.8-90.4%) at 1 month and the continued eradication rate was 52/57 (91.2%, 95% CI 80.7-97.1%) at 6 months post treatment. Comparison of four classification schemes showed similar results. Thus, the present investigation is suitably comparable in methods and results to previous studies. Levofloxacin was well tolerated. Four patients (3.4%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events and 15 patients (12.8%) experienced at least one adverse event. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily for 28 days is clinically and microbiologically effective in the treatment of CBP caused by susceptible pathogens and is well tolerated.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - In vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. In this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Entecoccus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. Ciprofloxacine discs (CIP, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: No inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. Ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of E. coli. The inhibition rates of Ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of CIP. Whereas MIC and MBC values of ketamine for S. aureus and S. pyogenes were 500 microg mL(-1), MIC and MBC values for P. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg mL(-1). For other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. We thought that it will be proper to use ketamine hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 3931 organisms isolated from intensive care units in Canada: Canadian National Intensive Care Unit Study, 2005/2006.
AB  - We tested the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci  and 12 antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacilli versus 3931 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained between September 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, from 19 intensive care units (ICUs) across Canada. The most active (based upon MIC only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.06 and < or =0.03, 0.25 and 0.12, 2 and 1, 0.5 and 0.5, and 1 and 2, respectively. The most active agents against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 1, 4, and 0.12, respectively. The most active agents against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4, < or =1, < or =0.12, 8, and 0.5, respectively. The most active agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were meropenem and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of < or =0.12 and 1, respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 16, 32, 16, and 64, respectively. The most active agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4 and 4, respectively. The most active agents against Acinetobacter baumannii were fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. In conclusion, the most active agents versus Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli obtained from Canadian ICUs were daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, dalbavancin and amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline (not P. aeruginosa), respectively.
TI  - A staphylococcal GGDEF domain protein regulates biofilm formation independently of cyclic dimeric GMP.
AB  - Cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is an important biofilm regulator that allosterically activates enzymes of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Proteobacterial genomes usually encode multiple GGDEF domain-containing diguanylate cyclases responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis. In contrast, only one conserved GGDEF domain protein, GdpS (for GGDEF domain protein from Staphylococcus), and a second protein with a highly modified GGDEF domain, GdpP, are present in the sequenced staphylococcal genomes. Here, we investigated the role of GdpS in biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Inactivation of gdpS impaired biofilm formation in medium supplemented with NaCl under static and flow-cell conditions, whereas gdpS overexpression complemented the mutation and enhanced wild-type biofilm development. GdpS increased production of the icaADBC-encoded exopolysaccharide, poly-N-acetyl-glucosamine, by elevating icaADBC mRNA levels. Unexpectedly, c-di-GMP synthesis was found to be irrelevant for the ability of GdpS to elevate icaADBC expression. Mutagenesis of the GGEEF motif essential for diguanylate cyclase activity did not impair GdpS, and the N-terminal fragment of GdpS lacking the GGDEF domain partially complemented the gdpS mutation. Furthermore, heterologous diguanylate cyclases expressed in trans failed to complement the gdpS mutation, and the purified GGDEF domain from GdpS possessed no diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro. The gdpS gene from Staphylococcus aureus exhibited similar characteristics to its S. epidermidis ortholog, suggesting that the GdpS-mediated signal transduction is conserved in staphylococci. Therefore, GdpS affects biofilm formation through a novel c-di-GMP-independent mechanism involving increased icaADBC mRNA levels and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Our data raise the possibility that staphylococci cannot synthesize c-di-GMP and have only remnants of a c-di-GMP signaling pathway.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Synergistic effect between different milk-derived peptides and proteins.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides derived from food proteins constitute a new field in the combined use of antimicrobial agents in food. The best examples of milk-derived peptides are those constituted by bovine lactoferricin [lactoferrin f(17-41)] (LFcin-B) and bovine alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207). The aim of this work was to study if the antimicrobial activity of a natural compound employed in food preservation, nisin, could be enhanced by combination with the aforementioned milk-derived peptides. Furthermore, the possibility of a synergistic effect between these peptides and bovine lactoferrin (LF) against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis was also studied. Finally, the most active combinations were assayed against the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella choleraesuis. Results showed a synergistic effect when LFcin-B was combined with bovine LF against E. coli. In the same way, the combination of LFcin-B with bovine LF was synergistic against Staph. epidermidis. Bovine LF and nisin increased their antimicrobial activity when they were assayed together with bovine alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207). It is important to note the synergistic effect among LFcin-B and bovine LF, because both compounds might be simultaneously in the suckling gastrointestinal tract and could, therefore, have a protective effect on it. The other synergistic effect high-lighted is that between alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207) and nisin against L. monocytogenes because of the ability of L. monocytogenes to develop resistance to nisin.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - Yersinia pestis biofilm in the flea vector and its role in the transmission of plague.
AB  - Transmission by fleabite is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation of Yersinia pestis, the bacterial agent of bubonic plague. To produce a transmissible infection, Y. pestis grows as an attached biofilm in the foregut of the flea vector. Biofilm formation both in the flea foregut and in vitro is dependent on an extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesized by the Yersinia hms gene products. The hms genes are similar to the pga and ica genes of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively, that act to synthesize a poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine ECM required for biofilm formation. As with extracellular polysaccharide production in many other bacteria, synthesis of the Hms-dependent ECM is controlled by intracellular levels of cyclic-di-GMP. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the food- and water-borne enteric pathogen from which Y. pestis evolved recently, possesses identical hms genes and can form biofilm in vitro but not in the flea. The genetic changes in Y. pestis that resulted in adapting biofilm-forming capability to the flea gut environment, a critical step in the evolution of vector-borne transmission, have yet to be identified. During a flea bite, Y. pestis is regurgitated into the dermis in a unique biofilm phenotype, and this has implications for the initial interaction with the mammalian innate immune response.
TI  - Substrata mechanical stiffness can regulate adhesion of viable bacteria.
AB  - The competing mechanisms that regulate adhesion of bacteria to surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation remain unclear, though nearly all studies have focused on the role of physical and chemical properties of the material surface. Given the large monetary and health costs of medical-device colonization and hospital-acquired infections due to bacteria, there is considerable interest in better understanding of material properties that can limit bacterial adhesion and viability. Here we employ weak polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films comprised of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), assembled over a range of conditions, to explore the physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of material surfaces controlling adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria and subsequent colony growth. Although it is increasingly appreciated that eukaryotic cells possess subcellular structures and biomolecular pathways to sense and respond to local chemomechanical environments, much less is known about mechanoselective adhesion of prokaryotes such as these bacteria. We find that adhesion of viable S. epidermidis correlates positively with the stiffness of these polymeric substrata, independently of the roughness, interaction energy, and charge density of these materials. Quantitatively similar trends observed for wild-type and actin analogue mutant Escherichia coli suggest that these results are not confined to only specific bacterial strains, shapes, or cell envelope types. These results indicate the plausibility of mechanoselective adhesion mechanisms in prokaryotes and suggest that mechanical stiffness of substrata materials represents an additional parameter that can regulate adhesion of and subsequent colonization by viable bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2006].
AB  - Using broth micro-dilution method, we studied the susceptibility of 180 clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis to meropenem (MEPM) and reference agents. All strains were isolated from the blood of patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January 2006 and November 2006. The results were as follows: 1. MEPM showed greater potency against Gram-negative bacteria than the other carbapenems including doripenem in particular. A metallo-beta-lactamase producing multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain was detected. 2. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of MEPM with that in our previous studies 1997-1998, 1999, 2002-2003, and 2004 showed no marked increase in MEPM-resistant clinical isolates. These results suggest that MEPM retains its potency as the agent of choice in treating serious infections.
TI  - Effect of growth conditions on poly-N-acetylglucosamine expression and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli contains a four-gene operon, pgaABCD, which encodes the proteins necessary for the synthesis of polymeric N-acetylglucosamine, or PGA. Poly-N-acetyl-glucosamine was first described in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and was found to have important roles in biofilm formation and immune evasion. PGA also plays a role in biofilm formation in E. coli, but its role in immune evasion has not been thoroughly studied. We previously reported that E. coli PGA cross-reacts with an opsonic-antibody raised against S. aureus PNAG and this is the basis for an ongoing investigation regarding the development of a vaccine against both pathogens. In this paper we investigated pga expression in wild type and csrA or nhaR deletion mutant strains during different growth phases and temperatures, and in response to chemical stimuli using a pga promoter-reporter fusion construct, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunoblotting, and biofilm assays. Expression of pga and polysaccharide synthesis were induced by glucose, NaCl, and ethanol, but only glucose augmented biofilm formation. The regulatory factor NhaR was required for NaCl-induced pga expression, whereas the effects of glucose and ethanol were independent of CsrA and NhaR.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Screening of chemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Artemisia essential oils.
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils isolated from aerial parts of seven wild sages from Western Canada -Artemisia absinthium L., Artemisia biennis Willd., Artemisia cana Pursh, Artemisia dracunculus L., Artemisia frigida Willd., Artemisia longifolia Nutt. and Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt., was investigated by GC-MS. A total of 110 components were identified accounting for 71.0-98.8% of the oil composition. High contents of 1,8-cineole (21.5-27.6%) and camphor (15.9-37.3%) were found in Artemisia cana, A. frigida, A. longifolia and A. ludoviciana oils. The oil of A. ludoviciana was also characterized by a high content of oxygenated sesquiterpenes with a 5-ethenyltetrahydro-5-methyl-2-furanyl moiety, of which davanone (11.5%) was the main component identified. A. absinthium oil was characterized by high amounts of myrcene (10.8%), trans-thujone (10.1%) and trans-sabinyl acetate (26.4%). A. biennis yielded an oil rich in (Z)-beta-ocimene (34.7%), (E)-beta-farnesene (40.0%) and the acetylenes (11.0%) (Z)- and (E)-en-yn-dicycloethers. A. dracunculus oil contained predominantly phenylpropanoids such as methyl chavicol (16.2%) and methyl eugenol (35.8%). Artemisia oils had inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis), yeasts (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans), dermatophytes (Trichophyton rubrum, Microsporum canis, and Microsporum gypseum), Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Aspergillus niger. A. biennis oil was the most active against dermatophytes, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Aspergillus niger, and A. absinthium oil the most active against Staphylococcus strains. In addition, antioxidant (beta-carotene/linoleate model) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities were determined, and weak activities were found for these oils.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Two new antibacterial norabietane diterpenoids from cyanobacteria, Microcoleous lacustris.
AB  - Two abietane diterpenes were isolated from cyanobacteria Microcoleous lacustris,  20-nor-3alpha-acetoxyabieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene and 20-nor-3alpha-acetoxy-12-hydroxy-abieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene. These compounds were assayed against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both compounds showed activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. typhi, and V. cholerae, but not against the other bacteria.
TI  - Chemical, biological and microbiological evaluation of cyclodextrin finished polyamide inguinal meshes.
AB  - This study describes the use of cyclodextrins (CDs) as a finishing agent of polyamide (PA) fibers used in order to obtain inguinal meshes with improved antibiotic delivery properties. The finishing process involved polymerization between citric acid and CDs, which yielded a cross-linked polymer that physically adhered to the surface of PA fibers. This permanent functionalization was characterized by evaluating the damping property with a polar liquid (glycerol) via the drop contact angle method for various rates of modification of the fabrics. The biological and microbiological effects of the PA, which were functionalized with hydroxypropylated derivate of gamma-CD (HP-gamma-CDs) and charged with ciprofloxacin (CFX), were evaluated by cell culture assays. We observed a good adhesion and proliferation of fibroblastic cells (NIH3T3) after 3 and 6 days and no detectable toxicity of the modified substrate. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the HP-gamma-CD grafted PA fabrics charged with CFX against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli was greatly superior to that of the virgin sample within a 24h batch experiment in human blood plasma medium. In conclusion, these results from our study offer an insight into the efficient performance of CDs as drug delivery systems for multiple applications in the fields of biomaterials and medical textiles.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of solar water disinfection under real sunlight conditions.
AB  - Batch solar disinfection (SODIS) inactivation kinetics are reported for suspensions in water of Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and endospores of Bacillus subtilis, exposed to strong natural sunlight in Spain and Bolivia. The exposure time required for complete inactivation (at least 4-log-unit reduction and below the limit of detection, 17 CFU/ml) under conditions of strong natural sunlight (maximum global irradiance, approximately 1,050 W m(-2) +/- 10 W m(-2)) was as follows: C. jejuni, 20 min; S. epidermidis, 45 min; enteropathogenic E. coli, 90 min; Y. enterocolitica, 150 min. Following incomplete inactivation of B. subtilis endospores after the first day, reexposure of these samples on the following day found that 4% (standard error, 3%) of the endospores remained viable after a cumulative exposure time of 16 h of strong natural sunlight. SODIS is shown to be effective against the vegetative cells of a number of emerging waterborne pathogens; however, bacterial species which are spore forming may survive this intervention process.
TI  - Roles of pgaABCD genes in synthesis, modification, and export of the Escherichia  coli biofilm adhesin poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
AB  - The linear homopolymer poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (beta-1,6-GlcNAc; PGA) serves as an adhesin for the maintenance of biofilm structural stability in diverse eubacteria. Its function in Escherichia coli K-12 requires the gene products of the pgaABCD operon, all of which are necessary for biofilm formation. PgaC is an apparent glycosyltransferase that is required for PGA synthesis. Using a monoclonal antibody directed against E. coli PGA, we now demonstrate that PgaD is also needed for PGA formation. The deletion of genes for the predicted outer membrane proteins PgaA and PgaB did not prevent PGA synthesis but did block its export, as shown by the results of immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and antibody adsorption assays. IEM also revealed a conditional localization of PGA at the cell poles, the initial attachment site for biofilm formation. PgaA contains a predicted beta-barrel porin and a superhelical domain containing tetratricopeptide repeats, which may mediate protein-protein interactions, implying that it forms the outer membrane secretin for PGA. PgaB contains predicted carbohydrate binding and polysaccharide N-deacetylase domains. The overexpression of pgaB increased the primary amine content (glucosamine) of PGA. Site-directed mutations targeting the N-deacetylase catalytic activity of PgaB blocked PGA export and biofilm formation, implying that N-deacetylation promotes PGA export through the PgaA porin. The results of previous studies indicated that N-deacetylation of beta-1,6-GlcNAc in Staphylococcus epidermidis by the PgaB homolog, IcaB, anchors it to the cell surface. The deletion of icaB resulted in release of beta-1,6-GlcNAc into the growth medium. Thus, covalent modification of beta-1,6-GlcNAc by N-deacetylation serves distinct biological functions in gram-negative and gram-positive species, dictated by cell envelope differences.
TI  - Treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  - Isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. We examined the organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. Patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic treatment, and complications were reviewed. The organisms included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (five), Streptococcus B beta hemolytic (five), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), Streptococcus viridans (one), Escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (one), and Propionibacterium acnes (one). We treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). One patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. Another patient died during hospitalization. Open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. Functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Enhanced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli in calves fed Morinda citrifolia (Noni) puree.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although adequate colostrum intake and properly used antibiotics can  provide much protection for the bovine neonate, increased antibiotic scrutiny and consumer demand for organic products have prompted investigations of natural immunomodulators for enhancing calf health. One plant-based immunomodulator, Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruit, is a well-recognized natural product that has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects. HYPOTHESIS: Neonatal calves fed noni puree would demonstrate whole blood phagocytic capacity in Gram-negative and Gram-positive in vitro assays. ANIMALS: Blood samples from 18 neonatal Holstein bull calves. METHODS: Calves were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 comprised control calves, whereas Group 2 received 30 mL of noni puree twice a day in milk replacer. Day 0 blood samples were obtained between 36 and 48 hours of age before the first feeding of puree. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulated blood was collected from each calf on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Bactericidal assays were performed to estimate the percentage killing of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. RESULTS: Blood samples from noni puree-fed calves displayed significantly more E. coli bacterial killing than did controls on day 14, and although differences were not significant on days 0, 3, and 7, bacterial killing progressively increased over time. There was no significant difference between the groups for S. epidermidis killing. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The immunomodulatory effect of noni puree may prove valuable in the future as production animal antibiotic use becomes more restricted. Additional clinical trials are warranted to investigate the clinical application of noni puree in promoting calf health.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Application of PCR-SSCP for molecular epidemiological studies on the exposure of  farm children to bacteria in environmental dust.
AB  - The environmental exposure of farm children to microorganisms in dust has become  a focus of interest, since microbial exposure on farms has been related to a reduced prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in children. Previous studies almost exclusively focused on the determination of microbial counts using conventional culturing or the determination of microbial compounds i.e. endotoxins. In this study PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) was modified for characterising bacterial communities in environmental dusts and their sensitivity and reproducibility was validated. A fivefold repeated PCR-SSCP analyses of a well homogenised mattress dust, cow-shed dust, swine-shed dust, chicken-shed dust and a horse-shed dust sample, respectively, showed similarities, based on Pearson correlations, ranging from 89.7% to 95.2%. The reproducibility of day to day variations (five days) and gel to gel variations (five gels) was also around 90%. The detection limit of Escherichia coli was 7 x 10(1) cfu g(-1) whereas Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus licheniformis containing 30% spores showed visible bands at 7 x1 0(2) cfu g(-1). Application of this method to dust samples of 37 sheds and 63 children's mattresses showed that distinct farm environment dusts reflected different SSCP profiles. However, digital analysis of the gels showed that some bands in the profiles of shed- and mattress dusts were found at the same position in the gels. By excision, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, these bands were identified as Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Corynebacterium mucifaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Brevibacterium iodinum, Brevibacterium linens and Arthrobacter spp, respectively. These results may reflect transfer of microorganisms from animal sheds to mattresses. In conclusion this study demonstrates that PCR-SSCP is a promising method with sensitive detection limits and moderate sample variances to be applied for epidemiological studies characterizing the exposure of farmers using environmental dust.
TI  - Simulated joint infection assessment by rapid detection of live bacteria with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although microbiological bacterial culture is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosis of septic arthritis, many studies have documented substantial false-negative and false-positive rates. The objective of this study was to determine whether real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction can be used to detect bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) in synovial fluid as a way to distinguish live and dead bacteria as an indicator of active infection. METHODS: Synovial fluid samples were obtained from twelve consecutive patients who presented with knee pain and effusion but no evidence of infection. Following assurance of sterility with plate cultures, each sample was inoculated with clinically relevant bacteria and incubated for twenty-four hours to simulate septic arthritis. Bacterial viability and load were assessed with cultures. Selected samples were also treated with a single dose of a combination of two antibiotics, vancomycin and gentamicin, and sampled at several time points. Total RNA isolated from each sample was analyzed in triplicate with one-step real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect mRNA encoding for the genes groEL or femC. Controls included sterile, uninoculated samples and inoculated samples analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction without reverse transcription. mRNA content was estimated on the basis of detection limits as a function of serial dilutions and was expressed as a function of colony number in bacterial cultures and RNA content as determined spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: All synovial fluid samples that had been inoculated with one of the four bacterial species, and analyzed in triplicate, were identified (distinguished from aseptic synovial fluid) with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; there were no false-negative results. All inoculated samples produced bacterial colonies on culture plates, while cultures of the aseptic samples were negative for growth. The detection limit of the one-step bacterial mRNA-based real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction varied depending on the bacterial species. A time-dependent decrease in the concentration of detectable bacterial mRNA was seen after incubation of bacteria with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The direct quantification of the concentration of viable bacterial mRNA with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction allows identification of both culture-positive bacterial infection and so-called unculturable bacterial infection in a simulated septic arthritis model. In contrast to conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction minimizes false-positive detection of nonviable bacteria and thus provides relevant information on the success or failure of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The shf gene of a Shigella flexneri homologue on the virulent plasmid pAA2 of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli 042 is required for firm biofilm formation.
AB  - Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an increasingly important cause of diarrhea in both developing and industrialized countries, and is characterized by strong biofilm formation on the intestinal mucosa. Sequencing of the virulent plasmid pAA2 of the prototype EAEC 042 revealed a cluster of three open reading frames (ORFs; shf, capU, and virK) ca. 93% identical to a similar cluster located in Shigella flexneri. The function of the first ORF Shf protein is not known, but the closest well-characterized homologue is the IcaB protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which plays a crucial role in exopolysaccharide modification in bacterial biofilm formation. To investigate the role of this cluster in the virulence of EAEC, we mutated three genes at this locus. All the mutants maintained the aggregative phenotype in the liquid phase. However, the insertional mutant of shf formed a less abundant biofilm in a microtiter plate assay than did the wild type, while the capU mutant and the virK mutant did not. The complementation of the shf mutant with this cluster restored the thick biofilm similar to that of the wild type. The shf transcriptional level decreased in the transcriptional regulator aggR mutant and was restored when the mutant was complemented with aggR. These results suggest that the shf gene is required for the firm biofilm formation of EAEC 042, and transcription of the shf gene is dependent on AggR.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - A new, simple approach to confer permanent antimicrobial properties to hydroxylated surfaces by surface functionalization.
AB  - A new, simple method to obtain ultrathin polycationic monolayers on hydroxylated  surfaces is described which uses a bifunctional copolymer comprising a reactive part (trimethoxysilane) and positive charges (quaternary ammonium salts) to confer antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Efficacy of combination of chlorhexidine and protamine sulphate against device-associated pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine: (i) the potential in vitro synergy of combining protamine sulphate (PS) with chlorhexidine (CHX); (ii) the in vitro spectrum and durability of antimicrobial activity of CHX + PS-coated catheters; and (iii) the in vivo efficacy of CHX + PS-coated catheters in comparison with silver-hydrogel-coated and uncoated catheters. METHODS: The potential synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of CHX and PS were investigated in vitro by the MIC and biofilm assays. The spectrum and durability of antimicrobial activity of CHX + PS-coated catheters were studied in vitro by using a serial plate transfer method. The in vivo efficacy of CHX + PS-coated catheters was assessed in a rabbit model against Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the combination of CHX + PS has a synergistic inhibitory effect on E. coli and provides a significant synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, catheters coated with CHX + PS provided a broad-spectrum and enduring in vitro antimicrobial activity over a 10 day period. The in vivo efficacy study demonstrated that subcutaneously implanted CHX + PS-coated catheters in rabbits are significantly less likely to become colonized (2/28 = 7%) than either silver-hydrogel-coated (25/28 = 89%; P < 0.001) or uncoated catheters (18/28 = 64%; P < 0.001) by E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic, broad-spectrum and durable in vitro activity of the CHX + PS combination and the robust in vivo efficacy of catheters coated with this unique composition encourage clinical evaluation of this innovative approach.
TI  - Diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
AB  - Bone infection in the diabetic foot is always a complication of a preexisting infected foot wound. Prevalence can be as high as 66%. Diagnosis can be suspected in two mains conditions: no healing (or no depth decrease) in spite of appropriate care and off-loading, and/or a visible or palpated bone with a metal probe. The first recommended diagnostic step is to perform (and if necessary to repeat) plain radiographs. After a four-week treatment period, if plain radiographs are still normal, suspicion for bone infection will persist in case of bad evolution despite optimized management of off-loading and arterial disease. It is only in such cases that other diagnosis methods than plain radiographs must be used. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen cultured from bone samples, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Among enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus sp. are the most common, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Surprisingly, bacteria usually considered contaminant (as coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) and Corynebacterium sp.) have been documented to be pathogens in the osteomyelitis of diabetic foot. Traditional approach to treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was by surgical resection of infected and necrotic bone. But new classes of antibiotics have both the required spectrum of activity and the capacity to penetrate and concentrate in the infected bone. Recently, several observations of osteomyelitis remission following non-surgical management with a prolonged course of antibiotics have been published. Lastly, combined approach with local bone excision and antibiotics has been proposed. Prospective trials should be undertaken to determine the relative roles of surgery and antibiotics in managing diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
TI  - Inactivation of S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, and E. coli bacteria bioaerosols deposited on a filter utilizing airborne silver nanoparticles.
AB  - In the present study, a control methodology utilizing airborne silver nanoparticles is suggested and tested with respect to its potential to control Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis, and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria bioaerosols deposited on filters. As it is known that the Gram-negative bacteria are sensitive to airflow exposure, the main focus of this study for testing the airborne silver nanoparticles effect was the Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis bacteria bioaerosols whereas Escherichia coli bioaerosols were utilized for comparison. Airborne bacteria and airborne silver nanoparticles were quantitatively generated in an experimental system. Bioaerosols deposited on the filter were exposed to airborne silver nanoparticles. The physical and biological properties of the airborne bacteria and airborne silver nanoparticles were measured via aerosol measurement devices. From the experimental results, it was demonstrated that this method utilizing airborne silver nanoparticles offers potential as a bioaerosol control methodology.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - A five-year study in Iran of ophthalmia neonatorum: prevalence and etiology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine the prevalence of conjunctivitis and its bacteriological causes in neonates hospitalized in two hospitals in Iran and to evaluate the maternal and newborns' data in conjunctivitis cases. MATERIAL/METHODS: All newborns presenting at Imam Khomeini and Vali-e-Asr hospitals (2001-2006) with clinical suspicion of conjunctivitis and positive microbiology were studied. The medical files of those with conjunctivitis were assessed. RESULTS: Of 4021 neonates examined for the presence of conjunctivitis, 198 (4.9%) had conjunctivitis. Sixty-five percent of the cases had been delivered by cesarean section, 47% and 11% had histories of maternal premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and genitourinary infection, respectively, 65% were preterm, and 61% and 32% had low weight and APGAR score below 7 at birth, respectively. In addition, 22% had septicemia. The most common organism causing ophthalmia was S. aureus (31%), followed by E. coli (23%), S. epidermis (22%), Klebsiella (10%), N. gonorrhea (3%), C. trachomatis (2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%). In the neonates with septicemia the most common cause of conjunctivitis was E. coli (38%). Neonates with E. coli conjunctivitis had a significantly (P<0.05) higher rate of a history of maternal genitourinary infection and a higher rate of septicemia than non-E. coli cases. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 4.9% found here is consistent with other reports ranging from 1.6 to 12% of neonates. Data such as birth weight, APGAR score, presence of septicemia, maternal genitourinary infections, and PROM may play a role in the development of neonatal conjunctivitis by different pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Characterization of the glutamyl endopeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - V8 protease, a member of the glutamyl endopeptidase I family, of Staphylococcus aureus V8 strain (GluV8) is widely used for proteome analysis because of its unique substrate specificity and resistance to detergents. In this study, an Escherichia coli expression system for GluV8, as well as its homologue from Staphylococcus epidermidis (GluSE), was developed, and the roles of the prosegments and two specific amino acid residues, Val69 and Ser237, were investigated. C-terminal His(6)-tagged proGluSE was successfully expressed from the full-length sequence as a soluble form. By contrast, GluV8 was poorly expressed by the system as a result of autodegradation; however, it was efficiently obtained by swapping its preprosegment with that of GluSE, or by the substitution of four residues in the GluV8 prosequence with those of GluSE. The purified proGluV8 was converted to the mature form in vitro by thermolysin treatment. The prosegment was essential for the suppression of proteolytic activity, as well as for the correct folding of GluV8, indicating its role as an intramolecular chaperone. Furthermore, the four amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the prosegment were sufficient for both of these roles. In vitro mutagenesis revealed that Ser237 was essential for proteolytic activity, and that Val69 was indispensable for the precise cleavage by thermolysin and was involved in the proteolytic reaction itself. This is the first study to express quantitatively GluV8 in E. coli, and to demonstrate explicitly the intramolecular chaperone activity of the prosegment of glutamyl endopeptidase I.
TI  - Reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  - The evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. Extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. In many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. It has recently been suggested that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. This study was designed to determine the reliability of PCT concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. The current study included 69 newborn babies. After full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. They had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. The second group: Group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified into twosubgroups: group 2A; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2B included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood culture. Blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and blood chemistry, additionally, CRP, serum IL-6 and PCT were measured. The microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2A; Escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group B streptococci (GBS) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was GBS positive mother. The comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (WBCs) and CRP levels were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. While in group 2B the WBCs not differed from group 1 but CRP differed from group 1. IL-6 and PCT values were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. Furthermore in group 2B both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. For the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, PCT give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.7%. At a cutoff >140 ng/ml, IL-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, speCificity of 70.4%, PPV of 64%, NPV of 63.3%. However, at a cutoff >12 mg/L, CRP gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, PPV of 77.1%, NPV of 70%. We conclude that the serum PCT concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - [Rational prophylaxis and treatment of infectious complications in kidney transplantation].
AB  - Clinical and bacteriological assessment of purulent complications in kidney transplantation has been carried out. The main infectious agents were S. epidermalis, E. coli, E. faecalis. Based on these data the optimal antibiotic therapy has been used that permitted to reduce the rate of infectious complications from 41 to 25.3%.
TI  - Effect of ethanol/trisodium citrate lock on microorganisms causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate (TSC) lock solution against the most common pathogens causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections. METHODS: Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 4), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (n = 8), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 4) were tested in duplicate. Bacterial suspensions of each isolate were made in a control solution of normal saline and Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), and in a lock solution of ethanol 30%, TSC 4% and MHB. Suspensions were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony counts were determined from samples collected at t = 0 h (before exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 1 h (one hour after exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 24 h and t = 48 h. To confirm the absence of viable organisms in the lock solution, the remaining volume at 48 h was filtered through a 0.45 microm filter. The filter was rinsed with 15 mL sterile water and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA). RESULTS: All controls demonstrated significant growth over 48 h. In the lock solutions, initial inocula were reduced to 0 viable colonies by t = 1 h (6-log kill), and there was no growth at t = 24 and 48 h. Filtering of lock solutions also showed no growth. These results were consistent among duplicates of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 30% ethanol/4% TSC lock solution consistently eradicated MRSA, MSSA, MRSE, P. aeruginosa and E. coli within 1 h of exposure. Experiments are currently underway to test this novel lock solution on preventing biofilm production by these pathogens.
TI  - Cytokine expression in response to bacterial antigens in preterm and term infant  cord blood monocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal susceptibility to bacterial infection is associated with an  immature immune system, but the role of different bacterial antigens in specific responses is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in intracellular cytokine response to physiologically relevant bacterial antigens in term and preterm infants as compared with adults. METHODS: Cord blood samples from preterm and term neonates and adult peripheral blood samples were cultured ex vivo with and without whole heat-killed bacteria. Intracellular leukocyte production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-8 responses was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Monocytes were the primary producers of all mediators. Escherichia coli was the most potent stimulant. Lactobacillus plantarum 299v activated fewer monocytes as compared with E. coli for all responses (p < 0.05), except for IL-12 in term neonates. IL-6 response to Staphylococcus epidermidis was lower in both groups of neonates as compared with adults (p = 0.023 and p = 0.001). IL-8 response to S. epidermidis was lower in term as compared with preterm neonates and adults (p = 0.003). IL-10 response to group B streptococci was lower in term neonates as compared with adults and higher in preterm as compared with term neonates (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Monocytes from term neonates compared to preterm neonates show a downregulated anti-inflammatory response to specific bacteria. High neonatal response to pathogenic E. coli in the preterm infant could cause uncontrolled inflammatory response, while lower IL-6 response to S. epidermidis in neonates may indicate a basis for vulnerability to S. epidermidis infection.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Development of a sanitizing fabric wipe for use on food contact surfaces.
AB  - A sanitizer was incorporated into disposable sanitary wipes that were used to eliminate microorganisms on plastic and metal surfaces. These surfaces were inoculated with strains of Bacillus subtilis OSU 494, Enterococcus faecalis OSU 48, Escherichia coli ATCC 29181, Listeria innocua ATCC 33090, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OSU 167, Salmonella enteritidis OSU 799, Staphylococcus epidermidis OSU 838), Candida albicans ATCC 10231, and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 10894. These inoculated surfaces were cleaned with the wipes for 5, 10, and 30 s, then organisms surviving on the cleaned surfaces and in the wipes were enumerated. Applying the sanitizing wipe to the plastic and metal surfaces reduced the viability of bacteria (> log 4 for 5 s), yeast cells (> log 5 for 10 s), and fungal spores (< log 4 for all times). The use of large pore sized or thick wipes showed better sanitizing result when compared with the use of the small pore sized and slim wipe. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between surviving numbers on the surface of the plastic compared with that of the metal.
TI  - Potential and limitation of UVC irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. In this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of UVC irradiation in platelet (PLT) concentrates was investigated. The dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on PLT quality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The potential of UVC irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (LE) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (NLE) and bacteria. LE viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). NLE viruses were canine parvovirus (CPV) and simian virus 40 (SV40). Bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. After spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (RFs) were calculated. Furthermore, the effect of UVC irradiation on PLT quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. RESULTS: A UVC dose of 500 J per m(2) resulted in acceptable PLT quality (as measured by pH, lactate production, CD62P expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high RFs (>4 log) for CPV, TGEV, VSV, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. Intermediate RFs (approx. 3 log) were observed for BVDV, PRV, and B. cereus. Low RFs (approx. 1 log) were found for HIV and SV40. No differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. CONCLUSION: UVC irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in PLT concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of HIV) under conditions that have limited effects on PLT quality. Further optimization of the UVC procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like HIV.
TI  - Interaction of a magainin-PGLa hybrid peptide with membranes: insight into the mechanism of synergism.
AB  - The antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and PGLa isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis show marked functional synergism. We have proposed that the two peptides form a heterodimer composed of parallel helices with strong membrane permeabilizing activity [Hara, T., Mitani, Y., Tanaka, K., Uematsu, N., Takakura, A., Tachi, T., Kodama, H., Kondo, M., Mori, H., Otaka, A., Fujii, N., and Matsuzaki, K. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12395-12399]. In this study, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the synergy, we synthesized a chemically fixed heterodimer and investigated in detail the interaction of the hybrid peptide with bacteria, erythrocytes, and lipid bilayers. The hybrid peptide showed antimicrobial activity and membrane permeabilizing activity against negatively charged membranes, similar to or even stronger than those of a physical equimolar mixture of magainin and PGLa, indicating that the synergy is due to the formation of a parallel heterodimer. The heterodimer assumed a more oblique orientation than the component peptides. In contrast, the cross-linking of the two peptides significantly strengthened the action against erythrocytes and zwitterionic lipid bilayers by enhancing the affinity for membranes without changing the basic mode of action. Thus, the separate production of mutually recognizing peptides without cross-linking appears to be a good way to increase selective toxicity.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - [Typical bacteria in an intensive care burn unit in severely burned patients and  their importance with regard to mortality: retrospective study 1995 - 2004].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify risk profiles for wound infection of severely burned patients in a retrospective analysis of patients of an intensive care burn unit during 1995 - 2004. The goal of this study was to identify risk factors on wound infection in severely burned patients. Possible influences on mortality were to be discussed. Inclusion criteria of the study population was a minimum age of 18 years and a body surface area burned of at least 40 % during the time period 1995 - 2004. 912 patients were screened and 96 patients were enrolled. Logistic regression was performed to investigate factors influencing wound infection and mortality in the study population. The initially detectable bacteria in the burn wounds were Staphylococcus aureus (21.1 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.2 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (16.2 %). Of all swabs taken the most frequent initial discovered bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.2 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7 %) and Escherichia coli (13.3 %). The majority of positive swabs were the burn wound followed by nose and tracheal secretion. The risk of a wound infection was more likely in the period 2000 - 2004 in comparison to 1995 - 1999 with an Odds Ratio of 0.17 (95 % KI [0.05 - 0.63], p = 0.008). Wound infection was promoted by longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit with an Odds Ratio of 2.62 (95 % KI [1.34 - 5.11], p = 0.005) and by bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body with an Odds Ratio of 5.36 (95 % KI [1.30 - 22.24], p = 0.02). Death was significantly promoted by age (over 50 years) with an Odds Ratio of 11.62 (95 % KI [2.76 - 48.92], p = 0.0008), wound infection with an Odds Ratio of 0.12 (95 % KI [0.03 - 0.52], p = 0.004) and inhalation injury with an Odds Ratio of 5.95 (95 % KI [1.72 - 20.55], p = 0.005). During the study period a rise of wound infections could be notified. Promoting factors were longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit and bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body. Regarding mortality, higher age, wound infection and inhalation injury were prognostic factors.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Development of an animal model to study meshes used in genital prolapse surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop an animal model using bacterial inoculation to evaluate tissue integration and tolerance to meshes used in genital prolapse surgery. STUDY DESIGN: We placed three different meshes under the abdominal skin of 120 Wistar rats: a polypropylene monofilament non-coated mesh (Parietene), a polypropylene monofilament collagen-coated mesh (Ugytex) and a polyethylene terephthalate mesh (Mersuture). We performed bacterial inoculation just after implantation with 1 ml of 10(7) colonies forming unit (CFU) of Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli. Rats were sacrificed 7, 14, 60, and 90 days after intervention. We used polarised light microscopy to analyse the collagen deposition and organisation. We quantified the inflammation cells. Bacterial analysis and quantification of the explanted meshes were performed. The exact Fisher's test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistics. RESULTS: We did not find any significant difference between inoculated or non-inoculated meshes in terms of collagen deposition. The scarring process seemed stable at day 90. Tissue integration was best with the polypropylene meshes, which allowed the development of a well-organised, mature connective tissue. Inflammatory reaction was higher in inoculated meshes, but only at day 7. At day 90, we found a high number of macrophages and multinuclear cells around all the meshes. There was no significant difference between prostheses that had been inoculated and those that had not with regard to positive bacterial culture. Quantification of bacterial colonies decreased with time. CONCLUSION: In this animal model, we did not find any clinically related difference in infection and tissue integration between the meshes used in genital prolapse. Such experimental studies must be carried out whenever new prostheses become available before their use is validated in common practice.
TI  - A prospective study on incidence of bacterial infections in portuguese dialysis units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral infection has been the main epidemiologic concern in the hemodialysis unit; however, bacterial infection is responsible for more than 30% of all causes of morbidity and mortality in our patients, vascular access infection being the culprit in 73% of all bacteremias. METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study of bacterial infections incidence, conducted from January to July 2004 in five hemodialysis units, to record and track bacterial infections, using a validated database from CDC's Dialysis Surveillance Network Program. RESULTS: 4,501 patient-months (P-M) were surveilled, being dialyzed through a native fistula (AVF) in 60.6%, a graft (PTFE) in 31.3%, a tunneled catheter (TC) in 7.6%, and a transient catheter (C) in 0.5%. As target events, we registered 166 hospitalizations - 3.7/100 P-M (2.2/100 P-M in patients with AVF, 4 in PTFE, 9.9 in TC, and 19 in C), and 182 intravenous antibiotic courses. Of these 182 antibiotic treatments, 47.8% included vancomycin, only 30% had blood cultures drawn pretreatment, and only 36% were positive. We recorded 98 infections at the vascular access site 2.18/100 P-M (0.95 in AVF, 1.6 in PTFE, 12.6 in TC, and 42.85 in C) and 2.13 infections/100 P-M at other sites. The isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 40.1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 30.1%, Pseudomonas in 13.3%, and Escherichia coli in 3.3%. Although we found a diversity of practice patterns, the number of target events (8.4/100 P-M) and the bacterial infections incidence (4.31/100 P-M) were remarkably homogeneous in the five centers. CONCLUSION: (1) High incidence of bacterial infections, causing major morbidity; (2) infectious risk is vascular access type-dependent, with dramatic rise in catheters; (3) underutilization of blood cultures to orient diagnosis and therapy, and (4) high rates of vancomycin prescription.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride on bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofilm formation and planktonic growth were tested in microtiter plates in the presence of antiseptics. For Escherichia coli G1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for Klebsiella pneumoniae CF504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. For PAO1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and CF504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. For Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), a total inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. For Staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC, biofilm formation was increased from 11.4% to 22.5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the Staph. epidermidis CIP53124 strain at sub-MICs. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction.
TI  - Sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). Uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. In all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in order to assess motility as a function of time. Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. Besides these bacterial strains, Candida albicans was also used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism concentration. However, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was prominent. Regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. No or poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with E. aerogenes at the second hour. The data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. Instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.
TI  - Expression and functional characterization of gfpmut3.1 and its unstable variants in Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Reporter gene systems are an invaluable tool for investigation of gene transcription activity in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In order to analyze the temporal and spatial resolution of gene expression patterns in situ and for quantitatively investigating gene expression, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) appears to be especially useful. GFP has been broadly used in various bacterial species, however, there is only limited knowledge about key biological properties in S. epidermidis. Here, the crucial influence of different ribosomal binding sites (RBS) on gfpmut3.1 translation initiation in S. epidermidis 1457 is demonstrated. Only by using the RBS of the delta-hemolysin promoter, after 24 hours a strong fluorescence signal was obtained. The half-life of GFPmut3.1 in S. epidermidis 1457 was significantly shorter than in E. coli (7 h vs. 24 h). GFPmut3.1 derivatives with shorter half-lives (GFP(AAV) and GFP(ASV)) did not reach sufficient quantitative protein levels, and the resulting low fluorescence limits their use as reporter genes in S. epidermidis. This work provides fundamental insights into gfpmut3.1 expression in S. epidermidis and describes the crucial determinants of its biological behavior in this species. In general, this study underlines the need to accurately characterize key biological properties of this transcription marker in gram-positive hosts.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  - A systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. A total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a panel of seven microbes (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. Several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied, giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. Further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against C albicans and slight activity against S. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against bacteria. Also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. In general, P. aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different for different microbes. Many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. The structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail. For high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. One hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. The effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. Halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.
TI  - Carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  - Certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. We report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. The compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. They were tested against Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion method. The carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. This activity was limited to one test organism (S. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. All other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. The hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. The mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.
TI  - Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a histidine decarboxylase from Staphylococcus capitis.
AB  - AIMS: Histamine intoxication is probably the best known toxicological problem of  food-borne disease. A histamine-producing Staphylococcus capitis strain has been isolated from a cured meat product. The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into the genetic determinants for histamine production in Staph. capitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence of a 6446-bp chromosomal DNA fragment containing the hdcA gene encoding histidine decarboxylase (HDC) has been determined in Staph. capitis IFIJ12. This DNA fragment contains five complete and two partial open reading frames. Putative functions have been assigned to gene products by sequence comparison with proteins included in the databases. The hdcA gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli resulting in HDC activity. The presence of a functional promoter (Phdc) located upstream of hdcA has been demonstrated. Insertion of the histamine biosynthetic locus in Staph. capitis seems to be associated with a noticeable genome reorganization. CONCLUSIONS: Among the staphylococcal species analysed in this study only Staph. capitis strains produce histamine. The hdcA gene cloned from Staph. capitis encodes a functional HDC that produce histamine from the amino acid histidine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The identification of the DNA region involved in histamine production in Staph. capitis will allow further work in order to avoid histamine production in foods.
TI  - Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. Objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. METHOD: Blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi). Concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, IL-1beta and interleukine-8, IL-8) were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. RESULTS: Blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. After stimulation by GBS and E. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. In cord blood, E. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 than S. epi, and more IL-6 than GBS; GBS induced more IL-1beta than S.epi. CONCLUSIONS: Response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. Each isolate of heat-killed bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. This may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.
TI  - [A broad-range 16S rRNA gene real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of neonatal septicemia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of a broad-range real-time PCR assay aimed  at the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria in a clinical setting in rapid and reliable diagnosis of neonatal septicemia for improving the speed and accuracy of bacterial detection. METHODS: The universal primer and TaqMan probe were designed based on the highly conserved sequences of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The chosen primers and probe did not show any likely cross hybridization with human, viral or fungal genome sequences. The TaqMan assay used the fluorescent signal on the probe, such as 6-carboxyfluorescin (6-FAM), and quenched by the standard 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) probes. The broad-range 16S rRNA gene real-time PCR array was established. Then, three common pathogenic microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, which were prepared by a 10-fold dilution series respectively from 10(8) colony forming unit (CFU)/ml to 10(3) CFU/ml, as well as controls, were used for testing of both sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR assay. The blood samples from 830 cases of suspected septicemia, who were hospitalized in our neonatal ward and the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and developed clinical signs suggestive of infection, were tested with routine culture and bacterial 16S rRNA genes real-time PCR separately. In addition, 30 neonates without infection were enrolled as the negative control group. RESULTS: All the three common pathogenic bacterial species were positive on the 16S rRNA genes real-time PCR assay. There were no cross-reaction with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), fungi, human DNA and blank control, and the technique showed high specificity and sensitivity. The detection limit of the TaqMan assay was tested by amplifying serial dilutions of the three common pathogenic bacterial DNA. The minimal detection limit of the TaqMan system was equivalent to 3 CFU of bacteria, the threshold cycle (CT), which is inversely proportional to the log of the amount of target DNA initially present, was 37.90 by calculation. The real-time PCR assay was evaluated on 830 blood specimens for suspected neonatal septicemia, as compared to the results obtained from the routine bacterial cultures. The positive rate by the real-time PCR assay was 5.18% (43/830) in 830 samples, and was significantly higher than that of blood culture [2.41% (20/830) (P < 0.01)]. The real-time PCR was positive in all the 20 positive blood culture samples. Thirty non-infectious blood samples were negative by both the PCR assay and blood cultures. When blood culture was used as control, the sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay was 100%, the specificity was 97.16%, and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.972. Moreover, three of the PCR positive amplicons were confirmed by sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the real-time PCR assay in testing clinical specimens. The sequencing showed that except for one sequence, all the others were demonstrated to be Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively, which was in accord with the results of the blood cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial 16S rRNA genes real-time PCR had been established to diagnose the neonatal septicemia. The sensitivity and specificity the real-time PCR assay were higher than those of blood culture. This technique can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia, and was a convenient and accurate method in etiologic diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial inactivation in prestorage pooled, leukoreduced, whole blood-derived platelet concentrates suspended in plasma prepared with photochemical treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photochemical treatment (PCT) with amotosalen and ultraviolet light was developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet (PLT) components suspended in 35 percent plasma and 65 percent additive solution (AS). Because PLT additive solutions (ASs) are not used in the United States, this study evaluated the ability of the PCT process to inactivate low levels of bacteria in pooled whole blood-derived PLTs (RDP) suspended in 100 percent plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four replicate experiments were performed with two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, and two Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. For each experiment, 6 ABO-identical RDP units were pooled, leukoreduced before or after pooling, inoculated to approximately 1 to 10 colony-forming units per mL with plasma-resistant bacteria, and treated with the PCT process. Residual viable bacterial levels were measured before and after each step and 4 and 6 days after inoculation. For each bacterium studied, a fifth RDP pool was prepared and contaminated, but not treated. These units served as controls for bacterial growth. RESULTS: Growth of S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae was eliminated in all four treated pools while growth continued in the control pools. There was no growth of E. coli in the treated pools and the control pool. CONCLUSION: These pilot experiments demonstrate inactivation of bacteria in PLTs suspended in plasma, suggesting that the PCT process may address contamination in conventional RDPs. Additional experiments with a wider range of bacteria and evaluation of PLT function in 100 percent plasma will be needed before implementation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of remifentanil and mixtures of remifentanil and propofol.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity of glycine, which is contained in remifentanil, when combined with propofol. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Departments of anesthesiology and microbiology of a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Growth of the microorganisms Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in propofol 1%; saline dilutions of remifentanil at one-, 10-, and 100-microg/mL concentrations; and 1:1 mixtures of propofol with remifentanil solutions was determined. MAIN RESULTS: Remifentanil inhibits bacterial growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The antibacterial effects were more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at cultures obtained at the fifth hour. The inhibition of bacterial growth was less influenced with Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol and remifentanil mixtures decreased bacterial growth, and combinations may reduce the infectious complications from accidentally contaminated propofol.
TI  - Antibacterial activation of hydroxyapatite (HA) with controlled porosity by different antibiotics.
AB  - In order to prevent the increasing frequency of per-operative infections, bioceramics can be loaded with anti-bacterial agents, which will release with respect to their chemical characteristics. A novel hydroxyapatite (HA) was elaborated with specific internal porosities for using as a bone-bioactive antibiotic (ATB) carrier material. UV spectrophotometry and bacteria inhibition tests were performed for testing the ATB adsorption and the microbiological effectiveness after loading with different antibiotics. The impregnation time, ATB impregnating concentration, impregnation condition and other factors, which might influence the ATB loading effect, were studied by exposure to different releasing solvents and different pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. It clearly showed that the facility of ATB loading on this porous HA is even possible just under simple non-vacuum impregnation conditions in a not-so-long impregnating interval. The results also showed that, for all three types of ATB (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin), adsorbed amount on the micro-porous HA were hugely higher than that on dense HA. The micro-porosity of test HA had also significantly prolonged the release time of antibiotics even under mimic physiological conditions. Furthermore, it also has primarily proved by a pilot test that the antibacterial efficiency of crude micro-porous HA could be further significantly improved by other methods of functionalization such as cold plasma technique.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Penetration of a selected antibiotic and antiseptic into a biofilm formed on orthopedic steel implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of octenidine hydrochloride and gentamicin on bacterial survival and reduction of biofilms formed on orthopaedic metal implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied metal orthopaedic components (screws, nails, fragments of wires used in Ilizarov devices) and a bone sequester. The presence and intensity of biofilm formation on the medical biomaterials was determined using the method of Richards et al. by visual evaluation of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction by viable bacteria. The presence and structure of the biofilm on the components of the Ilizarov device, screws and bone sequester was also studied by electron microscopy. Bacterial survival in the biofilm following exposure to the antibiotic and antiseptic was studied by CLSI microdilution method in microtitre plates using TTC. Results. Most of the 16 strains (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, Enterobacter) isolated from orthopaedic implants were able to form a biofilm. Established biofilms were resistant to gentamicin and octenidine hydrochloride but demonstrated greater susceptibility to octenidine. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that octenidine hydrochloride is more effective than gentamicin in the treatment of infections associated with the formation of a biofilm on orthopaedic implants.
TI  - Raman spectroscopic discrimination of cell response to chemical and physical inactivation.
AB  - Raman spectroscopy was applied to study Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells that were inactivated by different chemicals and stress conditions including starvation and high temperature. E. coli cells exposed to starvation conditions over several days lost viability at the same rate that spectral bands assigned to DNA and RNA bases decreased in intensity. Band intensities correlate with standard plate counts with R(2) = 0.99 and R(2) = 0.97, respectively. Principal components analysis and discriminant analysis multivariate statistical techniques were used to evaluate the spectral data collected. Significant changes were observed in the spectra of treated cells in comparison with their respective controls (samples without treatment). As a result, there was a significant differentiation between viable and non-viable cells (treated and non-treated cells) in the first and second principal component plots for all the treatments. Discriminant analysis was used along with PCA to estimate a classification rate based on viability status of the cells. Non-viable cells were differentiated from viable cells with classification rates that ranged between 60 and 90% for specific treatments (i.e., EDTA-treated cells versus control cells). The classification rate obtained considering all the treatments (non-viable cells) and controls (viable cells) at the same time for each of the species studied was 86%. The classification rate based on species differentiation when all the spectra (viable and non-viable) were used was 87%. These results suggest that Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate viability and to study metabolic changes in microorganisms. It is a robust method for bacterial identification even when high spectral variations are introduced.
TI  - Mechanical, tribological, and biocompatibility properties of ZrN-Ag nanocomposite films.
AB  - Nanocomposite films of ZrN-Ag were produced by reactive unbalanced magnetron sputtering, and their structural, chemical, mechanical, tribological, haemocompatibility, and antibacterial properties were studied as a function of film composition. The films formed a dense and homogeneous microstructure whereby nanocrystals of Ag are distributed evenly throughout the ZrN matrix. For small additions of silver, the hardness was found to increase, whereas the elastic modulus was found to decrease drastically. In the process of optimizing the deposition conditions, three kinds of coatings were prepared on 316 L surgical steel and tested by accelerated electrochemical polarization tests in order to detect the influence of Ag and the value of the bias potential on the corrosion performance of the system. Films produced under the optimum deposition conditions were, subsequently, deposited on medical grade Ti-Al-V and worn against ball-bearing steel using a ball-on-disk tribotester in bovine serum and were found to have superior tribological properties compared with single-phase ZrN coatings. The haemocompatibility of the films was assessed by investigating the adsorption of human serum albumin and fibrinogen on samples with different phase compositions. Quantification of the protein adsorption was carried out using spectroscopic ellipsometry, which confirmed the haemocompatibility of the films. Antibiotic activity of the films was quantified by incubating the films in bacterial cultures, namely, Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Films with a silver content > 10% exhibited superior antibacterial activity compared with the uncoated samples.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of phenyl-furanyl-rhodanines as inhibitors of RNA polymerase with antibacterial activity on biofilms.
AB  - The dramatic rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria over the past two decades has  stressed the need for completely novel classes of antibacterial agents. Accordingly, recent advances in the study of prokaryotic transcription open new opportunities for such molecules. This paper reports the structure-activity relationships of a series of phenyl-furanyl-rhodanines (PFRs) as antibacterial inhibitors of RNA polymerase (RNAP). The molecules have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit transcription and affect growth of bacteria living in suspension or in a biofilm and for their propensity to interact with serum albumin, a critical parameter for antibacterial drug discovery. The most active of these molecules inhibit Escherichia coli RNAP transcription at concentrations of </=10 microM and have promising activities against various Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, a major cause of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - [The analysis of the uterine cervix biocenosis in pregnant women].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infections of the vagina and the uterine cervix are some of the most  frequently diagnosed and treated complications during pregnancy. AIMS: The aim of the study was to carry out biocenosis of the uterine cervix among pregnant women and the assessment of the resistance of the previously isolated types of bacteria to antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was done in a group of 244 pregnant women, aged from 17 to 43, hospitalized and treated for various reasons in the Department of Pathology of Pregnancy at Medical University in Lodz. The biocenosis of the uterine cervix and the results of microbiological bacterial culture have been analyzed and the sensitivity of bacterial flora on the applied antibiotics has been assessed. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequent bacteria found in the smear from the uterine cervix. Negative culture was obtained in 2% of the pregnant women. The most frequently observed resistance to antibiotics manifested itself in case of amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The bacteria showed least resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Staphylococcus epidermidis showed the highest resistance to antibiotics in general. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of bacterial vaginal infections, with unknown sensitivity to bacteria, treatment the use of cephalosporins is highly recommended.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of tramadol against bacteria associated with infectious complications after local or regional anesthesia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tramadol is a synthetic analog of codeine with opioid and local anesthetic properties. It is used as a central-acting analgesic, and recently, in subcutaneous or intradermal injections, as a local anesthetic. We investigated in vitro the antibacterial activity of tramadol in the absence of any local anesthetics against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogens that can cause infectious complications after local or regional anesthesia. METHODS: Bacterial cultures were grown for 18 h, diluted in sterile physiological saline, and incubated for 6 or 24 h at 37 degrees C with 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/mL tramadol. The mixtures were then plated onto blood agar and colony counts were recorded after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Tramadol had bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. epidermidis compared with controls: at 25 mg/mL for 6 h or at 12.5 mg/mL for 24 h, tramadol decreased by approximately 7 log(10) (P < 0.001) the colony counts of E. coli (100% kill). Similar results were obtained with S. epidermidis, with approximately 6 log(10) reduction (100% kill) when tramadol was used at 25 mg/mL for 24 h (P < 0.001). The antibacterial effect of 25 mg/mL tramadol was lower against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, reducing the growth of these strains by approximately 3log(10) after 24 h (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol has dose- and time-dependent bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. epidermidis, as well as antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The antibacterial properties of tramadol may be useful for reducing the risk of bacterial infection after local or regional anesthesia.
TI  - Characterization of biofilm formed on intrauterine devices.
AB  - PURPOSE: Intrauterine device (IUD) is one of the most convenient contraceptive procedures used by women of Asian and African countries. Previous surveys have revealed that 75% of the IUDs recovered from patients suffering from reproductive tract infections (RTIs) were covered with a consortium of microbes. This study was designed to characterize these microbes and recommend remedial measures. METHODS: Quantitative measurement of biofilm formation was assessed by a microtitre plate assay on 86 samples of microorganisms dislodged from IUDs of patients with RTIs. Susceptibility of biofilm to various antimicrobial agents was also quantified. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to scrutinize the microorganisms adherent to IUDs. RESULTS: The organisms associated with IUDs were predominantly composed of Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), Escherichia coli (27%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2%), Candida albicans (20%) and Candida dubliniesis (12%). SEM studies indicated that these organisms were organized into biofilms. Studies on the in vitro adherence pattern by crystal violet staining on 96 well microtitre plates revealed that the biofilms were stably established after 60 hours. These biofilms are resistant to an array of antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: Biofilm formation may be one of the major causes for persistent infection and antibiotic resistance in IUD users.
TI  - Free chlorine demand and cell survival of microbial suspensions.
AB  - The utility of chlorine residual and chlorine demand as a surrogate for microbial contamination in the water distribution system was evaluated. The chlorine demanded by and cell survival of pure culture suspensions of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Mycobacterium aurum were quantified in solutions with initial free chlorine concentrations of 0.20, 0.40, and 0.80 mg/L. The chlorine demand increased with initial concentration of cells and free chlorine for all species. At equivalent initial cell concentrations, chlorine demand was greatest for M. aurum, followed by S. epidermidis and E. coli. The chlorine contact time required for a 3-log inactivation of E. coli, S. epidermidis, and M. aurum was calculated as 0.032+/-0.009, 0.221+/-0.080, and 42.9+/-2.71 mg min/L, respectively. The ultimate chlorine demand and cell survival were directly proportional. No chlorine demand was observed at cell concentrations less than 10(5)CFU/mL for E. coli or 10(4)CFU/mL for S. epidermidis. M. aurum demanded chlorine at all initial cell concentrations including 10(3)CFU/mL, which was the detection limit of the cell quantification assay. Chlorine demand was determined to be a suitable surrogate indicator of the organisms studied and its utility may be enhanced in locations of the water distribution system that maintain a higher free chlorine residual.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements.
AB  - Evidences supporting the introduction of metallic elements in several biological  processes are rapidly accumulating. Likewise, many drugs possess modified toxicological and pharmacological properties when in the form of metal complexes. In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various cephalosporins, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements has been studied and compared with the parent drug. The essential and trace elements comprised of magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, ferric, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium in the form of their chloride. These studies were carried out by observing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using agar dilution method and compared with the MIC'S of the standard cephalosporins against various species of Gram (+) and Gram (-) microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae. Different dilutions of cephalosporins and salts of essential and trace elements were used in these studies. The ratio of the drug and metal salts was 1:1 and the reactions were carried out at two different temperatures as 37 degrees C and 60 degrees C in order to study the complex formation. The aim of our study was on one hand to evaluate the changes in microbiological activity of the standard cephalosporins after in vitro metal interactions to study the synergetic or antagonistic behavior of the later through the difference in MICs values of these cephalosporins and on the other hand to access the bioassay directed extent of drug metal complexations. Our investigation reveal that interaction of above cephalosporins with essential and trace elements cause antagonistic effect in many cases which was shown by decrease in antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins and MIC values were increased.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Effect of oral application of a probiotic E. coli strain on the intestinal microflora of children of allergic mothers during the first year of life.
AB  - Influence of intestinal colonization by a probiotic E. coli strain on the incidence of bacterial pathogens in stool and allergic symptoms during the 1st year of life was monitored in 3 groups: colonized children of allergic mothers (AC; n = 52), noncolonized children of allergic mothers (AN; n = 50), children of nonallergic mothers (NC; n = 42). Colinfant vaccine was administered within 2 d after birth, 3 x a week over a period of 4 weeks. Stool samples were examined after 2 d and at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months. At 3 months E. coli was present in 90 %, at 12 months in 73 % of AC. Pathogens were significantly less frequent on day 3 and at 3 months in AC vs. AN (15 vs. 61 %, p < 0.001; 15 vs. 38 %, p < 0.01) and vs. NC (15 vs. 63 %, p < 0.001; 15 vs. 53 %, p < 0.001). AC exhibited lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis than AN on day 3 (6 vs. 31 %, p < 0.001) and of Klebsiella strains on day 3 and at 3 months (4 vs. 20 %, p < 0.05; 5 vs. 24 %, p < 0.01). AC showed a lower incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa than NC on day 3 (6 vs. 31 %, p < 0.01) and Klebsiella spp. on day 3 and at 3 months (4 vs. 22 %, p < 0.05; 5 vs. 45 %, p < 0.001). No significant differences were recorded after 6 and 12 months. The incidence of allergies was 3 % in AC, 26 % in AN (p < 0.01), and 10 % in NC.
TI  - The inhibition of the adhesion of clinically isolated bacterial strains on multi-component cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer coatings.
AB  - This study examined bacterial adhesion to a new multi-component cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer coating that can be applied by spin-coating or spraying onto diverse biomaterials. Adhesion of five clinically isolated bacterial strains involved in biomaterial-centered infections were studied in a parallel-plate flow chamber at different shear rates and after exposure of the coating to different physiological fluids. The new chemistry inhibits non-specific biomolecular and cell binding interactions. Relative to glass, the coating reduced adhesion of all strains used in this study by more than 80%, with the exception of Escherichia coli O2K2. Reductions in adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis 3,399 persisted beyond 168h exposure of the coatings to phosphate buffered saline or urine, but not after exposure to protein-rich fluids as saliva and blood plasma, despite evidence from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the coating integrity was not affected by exposure to these fluids. We conclude that this new coating chemistry provides beneficial properties to prevent or hinder bacterial adhesion and colonization in applications where low protein-conditions prevail.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine and metal complexes of 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A series of 2-benzylideneaminonaphthothiazoles were designed and synthesized incorporating the lipophilic naphthalene ring to render them more capable of penetrating various biomembranes. METHODS: Schiff bases were synthesized by the reaction of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine with various substituted aromatic aldehydes. 2-(2'-Hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole was converted to its Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal complexes upon treatment with metal salts in ethanol. All the compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities by paper disc diffusion method with Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of all the Schiff bases and metal complexes were determined by agar streak dilution method. RESULTS: All the compounds moderately inhibited the growth of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. In the present study among all Schiff bases 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole showed maximum inhibitory activity and among metal complexes Cu(II) metal complex was found to be most potent. CONCLUSION: The results obtained validate the hypothesis that Schiff bases having substitution with halogens, hydroxyl group and nitro group at phenyl ring are required for the antibacterial activity while methoxy group at different positions in the aromatic ring has minimal role in the inhibitory activity. The results also indicated that the metal complexes are better antibacterial agents as compared to the Schiff bases.
TI  - Geographical variation in cloacal microflora and bacterial antibiotic resistance  in a threatened avian scavenger in relation to diet and livestock farming practices.
AB  - The impact on wildlife health of the increase in the use of antimicrobial agents  with the intensification of livestock production remains unknown. The composition, richness and prevalence of cloacal microflora as well as bacterial resistance to antibiotics in nestlings and full-grown Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus were assessed in four areas of Spain in which the degree of farming intensification differs. Differences in diet composition, especially the role of stabled livestock carrion, appear to govern the similarities of bacterial flora composition among continental populations, while the insular vulture population (Fuerteventura, Canary Islands) showed differences attributed to isolation. Evidence of a positive relationship between the consumption of stabled livestock carrion and bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics was found. Bacterial resistance was high for semisynthetic penicillins and enrofloxacin, especially in the area with the most intensive stabled livestock production. The pattern of antibiotic resistance was similar for the different bacterial species within each area. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics may be determined by resistance of bacteria present in the livestock meat remains that constituted the food of this species, as indicated by the fact that resistance to each antibiotic was correlated in Escherichia coli isolated from swine carrion and Egyptian vulture nestlings. In addition, resistance in normal faecal bacteria (present in the microflora of both livestock and vultures) was higher than in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a species indicator of the transient flora acquired presumably through the consumption of wild rabbits. Potential negative effects of the use of antimicrobials in livestock farming included the direct ingestion of these drug residues and the effects of bacterial antibiotic resistance on the health of scavengers.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of clove and rosemary essential oils alone and in combination.
AB  - In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. et Perry) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) was tested alone and in combination. The compositions of the oils were analysed by GC/MS. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against three Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria and two fungi were determined for the essential oils and their mixtures. Furthermore, time-kill dynamic processes of clove and rosemary essential oils against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were tested. Both essential oils possessed significant antimicrobial effects against all microorganisms tested. The MICs of clove oil ranged from 0.062% to 0.500% (v/v), while the MICs of rosemary oil ranged from 0.125% to 1.000% (v/v). The antimicrobial activity of combinations of the two essential oils indicated their additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects against individual microorganism tests. The time-kill curves of clove and rosemary essential oils towards three strains showed clearly bactericidal and fungicidal processes of (1)/(2) x MIC, MIC, MBC and 2 x MIC.
TI  - High-throughput synthesis and screening of cyclic peptide antibiotics.
AB  - Cyclic peptides are a rich source of biologically active compounds and are produced in nature by plants, bacteria, fungi, and lower sea animals. A high-throughput methodology has been developed for the combinatorial synthesis, screening, and identification of cyclic peptide natural product analogues with improved biological activities or useful new activities. The methodology was applied to generate a library of 1716 tyrocidine A analogues, which were screened for antibacterial activity in 96-well plates. The identity of the active peptides was determined by partial Edman degradation/mass spectrometry. This has resulted in the discovery of a series of tyrocidine analogues that have significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the natural product. The availability of tyrocidine analogues with varying antibacterial activities has provided important insights into the structure-function relationship of tyrocidine A, which should help reveal its mechanism of action.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  - The embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. However, this procedure is not without complications. A systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. Seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. Arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. Abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). Other isolated pathogens included Salmonella species type D (n = 1; 14.3%), S. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), Escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). Surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. All reviewed patients were cured. Even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. However, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of positive and negative polarity low-voltage pulsed current (LVPC) on six typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of chronic wounds.
AB  - The positive effect of electrical stimulation (ES) on wound healing has been shown in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of increased blood flow, protein denaturation, and stimulation of cellular defense, an antibacterial effect of ES is to be expected. Although the antibacterial effect of ES already has been demonstrated in vitro, little attention has been paid to the direct antibacterial effect of changing polarity of the applied current. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of positive and negative monophasic low-voltage pulsed current on typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens of chronic wounds. Using the Dermapulse-System, three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia faecium) organisms were tested against positive and negative polarity low voltage pulsed current. All tested organisms were significantly reduced by ES. The reduction differed significantly between positive polarity and control and negative polarity and control, with the highest log10 reduction factor (RF) achieved with positive polarity. Using positive polarity, the maximum RF was measured for E. coli (median log10 RF 0.83; 25th percentile 0.59, 75th percentile 0.98) and the lowest for S. epidermidis (median log10 RF 0.20; 25th percentile 0.17, 75th percentile 0.24). Yet, there was no significant difference with positive ES against Gram-positive or Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - A functional homing endonuclease in the Bacillus anthracis nrdE group I intron.
AB  - The essential Bacillus anthracis nrdE gene carries a self-splicing group I intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the GIY-YIG family. Here, we show that the nrdE pre-mRNA is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrdE gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. We also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. The position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a GIY-YIG homing endonuclease. Interestingly, nrdE genes from several other Bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nrdE1), B. anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus lichenformis, and S. epidermidis (nrdE2). On the other hand, nrdE genes from Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. Intervening sequences (IVSs) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrdE gene is a frequent target for self-splicing IVSs. A comparison of nrdE genes from seven gram-positive low-G+C bacteria, two bacteriophages, and Nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing IVSs within the coding region of the nrdE gene.
TI  - Electrophoretic and dielectrophoretic field gradient technique for separating bioparticles.
AB  - We describe a new device for separation of complex biological particles and structures exploiting many physical properties of the biolytes. The device adds a new longitudinal gradient feature to insulator dielectrophoresis, extending the technique to separation of complex mixtures in a single channel. The production of stronger local field gradients along a global gradient allows particles to enter, initially transported through the channel by electrophoresis and electroosmosis, and to be isolated according to their characteristic physical properties, including charge, polarizability, deformability, surface charge mobility, dielectric features, and local capacitance. In this work, the separation mechanism is described in terms of the relevant electromechanical principles, and proof-of-principle is demonstrated using various bacteria cells as model systems. The results demonstrate the selectivity of the technique and suggest that it may form the foundation for a versatile and useful tool for separating mixtures of complex biological particles and structures.
TI  - Protection against Escherichia coli infection by antibody to the Staphylococcus aureus poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide.
AB  - Poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) is a surface polysaccharide produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and is an effective target for opsonic and protective Ab for these two organisms. Recently, it has been found that Escherichia coli produces an exo-polysaccharide, designated polyglucosamine, that is biochemically indistinguishable from PNAG. We analyzed 30 E. coli strains isolated from urinary tract and neonatal bloodstream infections for the pga locus, PNAG antigen production, and susceptibility to opsonic killing and protection from lethal infection by Ab to PNAG. Twenty-six of 30 strains carried the pga locus, 25 of 30 expressed immunologically detectable PNAG, and 21 of 30 could be killed by rabbit IgG specific for the deacetylated form of the staphylococcal PNAG. Ab to staphylococcal PNAG protected mice against lethality from five different E. coli strains expressing PNAG. PNAG expression by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms could make this antigen a conserved vaccine target for multiple pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of MONOCRYL plus antibacterial suture (Poliglecaprone 25 with triclosan).
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Poliglecaprone 25 sutures with and without triclosan were tested for in vitro efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli by a zone of inhibition assay. The suture also was tested against Escherichia coli in a colonization assay in a dynamic model simulating in vivo conditions. An in vitro triclosan diffusion assay and a sustained efficacy assay were performed by concurrent high-performance liquid chromatography and zone of inhibition assay. To assess stability, antibacterial efficacy testing was performed on samples held more than five months at elevated temperature. RESULTS: Poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan demonstrated significant in vitro efficacy against a range of bacteria. The suture sustained in vitro efficacy for 11 days, corresponding to the in vitro triclosan diffusion profile. CONCLUSION: Triclosan reduced in vitro colonization of poliglecaprone 25 suture by several strains of bacteria compared with untreated control sutures.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Poly-N-acetylglucosamine mediates biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in  Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - Most field isolates of the swine pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae form tenacious biofilms on abiotic surfaces in vitro. We purified matrix polysaccharides from biofilms produced by A. pleuropneumoniae field isolates IA1 and IA5 (serotypes 1 and 5, respectively), and determined their chemical structures by using NMR spectroscopy. Both strains produced matrix polysaccharides consisting of linear chains of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in beta(1,6) linkage (poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc or PGA). A small percentage of the GlcNAc residues in each polysaccharide were N-deacetylated. These structures were nearly identical to those of biofilm matrix polysaccharides produced by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. PCR analyses indicated that a gene encoding the PGA-specific glycoside transferase enzyme PgaC was present on the chromosome of 15 out of 15 A. pleuropneumoniae reference strains (serotypes 1-12) and 76 out of 77 A. pleuropneumoniae field isolates (serotypes 1, 5 and 7). A pgaC mutant of strain IA5 failed to form biofilms in vitro, as did wild-type strains IA1 and IA5 when grown in broth supplemented with the PGA-hydrolyzing enzyme dispersin B. Treatment of IA5 biofilms with dispersin B rendered them more sensitive to killing by ampicillin. Our findings suggest that PGA functions as a major biofilm adhesin in A. pleuropneumoniae. Biofilm formation may have relevance to the colonization and pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae in pigs.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of different gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different trademarks and compositions of gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes used in endodontic therapy. The evaluated material consisted of gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko), gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine (Roeko), two conventional gutta-percha points (Endo Points and Roeko) and two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC). Antimicrobial tests included five species of microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341). The Agar diffusion method was employed. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel was added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. Statistical evaluation was carried out using analysis of variance and Tukey Test. The obtained results showed that all microbial species used in the study were inhibited by the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine and by the calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC), with similar results (p > 0.05). No antimicrobial activity was observed for the other groups. It was concluded that the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine presented antimicrobial activity, whereas the gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide did not.
TI  - Levobupivacaine hydrochloride and sufentanil have no antimicrobial effect at 25 degrees C in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Levobupivacaine in combination with sufentanil may be  used for labour or postoperative regional analgesia. The risk of bacterial growth within these contained solutions for several hours at room temperature is unknown. We investigated the in vitro antimicrobial effect of levobupivacaine and sufentanil against common micro-organisms encountered during regional anaesthesia. METHODS: Standardized suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were incubated for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h at 25 degrees C, with saline (as control), sufentanil 0.5 or 0.75 microg mL-1, levobupivacaine hydrochloride 5.6 mg mL-1 and concentrations of 1.4, 2.8 and 5 mg mL-1 of levobupivacaine hydrochloride with sufentanil 0.5 microg mL-1. Colony counts were compared after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: No bacterial growth was observed on any bacterial strain for any solution tested throughout the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that solutions of levobupivacaine combined with sufentanil may be used for 24 h at room temperature during regional anaesthesia with no risk of bacterial growth.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of native and inactivated microorganisms.
AB  - The research of microorganisms includes the development of methods for the inactivation of viruses and other microbes. It also means to efficiently eliminate the infectivity of microorganisms without damage of their integrity and structure. According to the results of the last 5 years the capillary electromigration techniques appear to be very perspective for the comparison of the methods applicable for inactivation in the diagnostics and study of the pathogens. In this paper we suggest the capillary isoelectric focusing of the model microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and bacteriophage PhiX 174, native or inactivated by different procedures. UV detection and fluorometric detection for the dynamically modified microbes by pyrenebutanoate on the basis of the non-ionogenic tenside were used here. Isoelectric points of native and/or dynamically modified microorganisms and other properties were compared with those obtained after microorganisms inactivation. The segmental injection of the sample pulse enabled the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing in different pH gradients. The low-molecular-weight pI markers were used for tracing of the pH gradient.
TI  - Action mechanism of tachyplesin I and effects of PEGylation.
AB  - PEGylation of protein and peptide drugs is frequently used to improve in vivo efficacy. We investigated the action mechanism of tachyplesin I, a membrane-acting cyclic antimicrobial peptide from Tachypleus tridentatus and the effects of PEGylation on the mechanism. The PEGylated peptide induced the leakage of calcein from egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylglycerol/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles similarly to the parent peptide. Both peptides induced lipid flip-flop coupled to leakage and was translocated into the inner leaflet of the bilayer, indicating that tachyplesin I forms a toroidal pore and that PEGylation did not alter the basic mechanism of membrane permeabilization of the parent peptide. Despite their similar activities against model membranes, the peptides showed very different biological activities. The cytotoxicity of tachyplesin I was greatly reduced by PEGylation, although the antimicrobial activity was significantly weakened. We investigated the enhancement of the permeability of inner membranes induced by the peptides. Our results suggested that outer membranes and peptidoglycan layers play an inhibitory role in the permeation of the PEG moiety. Furthermore, a reduction in DNA binding by PEGylation may also contribute to the weak activity of the PEGylated peptide.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Maternal morbidity following routine second trimester genetic amniocentesis.
AB  - Two cases of septic complications of routine second trimester amniocentesis are presented. The first case is a 37-year-old gravida suffering from ulcerative colitis who was admitted for amniocentesis in the 18th week of her third pregnancy. An uncomplicated transabdominal amniocentesis was performed using a sterile technique and ultrasound guidance. Twenty-eight hours later the patient had a septic abortion and sepsis. The second case is a 34-year-old gravida in the 24th week of her pregnancy who was admitted with amnionitis 10 h after an uncomplicated amniocentesis, and subsequently had a septic abortion. A high index of suspicion and rapid intervention were crucial in both cases.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Trichophyton species by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to inhibit the growth  of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (TM) and Trichophyton rubrum (TR). DESIGN: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis were grown in co-culture with either TM or TR. SETTING: An academic medical center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The total fungal units and hyphal-spore ratio were measured at days 1, 5, 10, and 15. RESULTS: There was a 73% and 46% reduction of total fungal units and a final hyphal-spore ratio of 0.16 and 0.04, respectively, when TM and TR were co-cultured with P aeruginosa. The number of fungal units increased when TM and TR were cultured with E coli (28% and 42%, respectively), S epidermidis (13% and 18%, respectively), and control media (44% and 62%, respectively), and the hyphal-spore ratio increased to above 30 in the presence of S epidermidis, E coli, and control media. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits growth inhibitory properties against TM and TR.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes with Schiff base derived from 4-amino-3-mercapto-6-methyl-5-oxo-1,2,4-triazine.
AB  - A few (1:1) and (1:2) metal complexes of cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) have been isolated with ligand derived from the condensation of 4-amino-3-mercapto-6-methyl-5-oxo-1,2,4-triazine with 2-acetylpyridine (L(1)) and characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity measurements, infrared, electronic, (1)H NMR spectral data, magnetic and thermogravimetric analyses. Due to insolubility in water and most of the common organic solvents and infusibility at higher temperatures, all the complexes are thought to be polymeric in nature. A square-planar geometry was suggested for copper(II) and octahedral proposed for cobalt(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II). Some of the chemically synthesized compounds have been screened in vitro against the three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis) and two Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli) organisms. It is observed that the coordination of metal ion has pronounced effect on the microbial activities of the ligand. The metal complexes have higher antimicrobial effect than the free ligands.
TI  - Organoiodine(III) mediated synthesis of 3,9-diaryl- and 3,9-difuryl-bis-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][4,3-c]pyrimidines as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Nine 3,9-diaryl- and 3,9-difuryl-bis-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][4,3-c]pyrimidines (3a-i) have been synthesized by the oxidation of bis-2,4-pyrimidinylhydrazones of various araldehydes and furfural with 2equiv of iodobenzene diacetate (IBD) in dichloromethane and tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity. Three compounds, namely 3,9-di-(4'-fluorophenyl)-bis-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][4,3-c]pyrimidine (3f), 3,9-di-(4'-nitrophenyl)-bis-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][4,3-c]pyrimidine (3g) and 3,9-di-(5'-nitro-2'-furyl)-bis-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][4,3-c]pyrimidine (3i), were associated with substantially higher antibacterial activity than some commercial antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis; two Gram-negative bacteria namely Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli at MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) 10microg/ml.
TI  - Dry reagent dipstick test combined with 23S rRNA PCR for molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection in arthroplasty.
AB  - Periprosthetic joint infections present a challenging problem in orthopaedics. Conventional methods for detection of arthroplasty infections rely on bacterial culture of synovial fluid aspirates. During recent years, however, molecular tests that are based on DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products, have been introduced. We report a simple and inexpensive assay that allows visual detection and confirmation of the PCR-amplified sequences by hybridization within minutes. The assay is performed in a dry reagent dipstick format (strip) and does not require special instrumentation. Universal primers are used for PCR of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The biotinylated amplification product is hybridized with dA-tailed probes that are specific for six pathogens commonly involved in periprosthetic joint infections. The mixture is applied to the strip, which is then immersed in the appropriate buffer. The buffer migrates along the strip by capillary action and rehydrates gold nanoparticles with oligo(dT) strands attached to their surface. The nanoparticles bind to the target DNA through hybridization, and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the strip, producing a characteristic red line. Unbound nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dT) strands at the control zone of the strip, generating a second line. The dipstick test was applied to the detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faesium, and Haemophilus influenza. Twelve samples of synovial fluids from patients were analyzed for the detection and identification of the infection caused by the six pathogens. The results were compared with bacterial cultures.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aerobic bacteria in chronic discharging ears and determine their antibiotic susceptibilities, which is essential for reasonable empiric treatment. METHODS: Ear swabs of discharging ears aseptically collected from 102 patients of various age groups attending Ear, Nose, and Throat out-patient clinic at University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital were cultured for bacterial agents using blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar. Culture plates were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 24-48 hours. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods. Members of the family enterobacteriaceae were identified using enterotubes. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out for 13 drugs using disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the patients studied were in the age group 0-14 years and there were more male infants than females. Gram negative bacteria comprised 75% of the isolates. Predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41%), Proteus sp. (22%), Staphylococcus aureus (22%), Escherichia coli and other coliforms (11%). Drug susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that ceftazidime, ceftriazone and gentamycin were most effective drugs in vitro. CONCLUSION: The predominant bacterial agents in chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria were gram negative bacteria and included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Escherichia coli. Gram positive bacterial constituted 25 percent of the isolates and included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. Ceftazidime, ceftrixone and gentamycin were the most effective drugs in vitro.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of Salvia sclarea L.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant Staphylococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of Salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. The growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) but not Gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). Abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. This was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. The highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. It limited the survival of biofilms formed by S. aureus as well as by S. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
TI  - Catalases are NAD(P)H-dependent tellurite reductases.
AB  - Reactive oxygen species damage intracellular targets and are implicated in cancer, genetic disease, mutagenesis, and aging. Catalases are among the key enzymatic defenses against one of the most physiologically abundant reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide. The well-studied, heme-dependent catalases accelerate the rate of the dismutation of peroxide to molecular oxygen and water with near kinetic perfection. Many catalases also bind the cofactors NADPH and NADH tenaciously, but, surprisingly, NAD(P)H is not required for their dismutase activity. Although NAD(P)H protects bovine catalase against oxidative damage by its peroxide substrate, the catalytic role of the nicotinamide cofactor in the function of this enzyme has remained a biochemical mystery to date. Anions formed by heavy metal oxides are among the most highly reactive, natural oxidizing agents. Here, we show that a natural isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to tellurite detoxifies this anion thanks to a novel activity of its catalase, and that a subset of both bacterial and mammalian catalases carry out the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of soluble tellurite ion (TeO(3)(2-)) to the less toxic, insoluble metal, tellurium (Te(o)), in vitro. An Escherichia coli mutant defective in the KatG catalase/peroxidase is sensitive to tellurite, and expression of the S. epidermidis catalase gene in a heterologous E. coli host confers increased resistance to tellurite as well as to hydrogen peroxide in vivo, arguing that S. epidermidis catalase provides a physiological line of defense against both of these strong oxidizing agents. Kinetic studies reveal that bovine catalase reduces tellurite with a low Michaelis-Menten constant, a result suggesting that tellurite is among the natural substrates of this enzyme. The reduction of tellurite by bovine catalase occurs at the expense of producing the highly reactive superoxide radical.
TI  - Bismuth-norfloxacin complex: synthesis, physicochemical and antimicrobial evaluation.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent which is active against various Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative microorganisms. Presence of metal ions considerably alters the activity of fluoroquinolones against potentially susceptible bacteria. As bismuth is known to possess a good antibacterial activity, bismuth complex of norfloxacin was prepared by reacting bismuth citrate with aqueous solution of norfloxacin. The structure of the bismuth-norfloxacin complex (BNC) was confirmed by spectral, chemical and elemental analysis. Antimicrobial studies were carried out using agar diffusion method against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Klebsiella pneumoniae (NTCC 10320), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Bacillus pumilis (NTCC 8241) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228). The results showed significant increase (p<0.05, Tukeys test) in antibacterial activity of BNC as compared with norfloxacin and physical mixture of norfloxacin and bismuth citrate. This increase in activity is being considered due to increased bioavailability of the metal drug complex. Thus, the use of the BNC may be preferable over norfloxacin alone.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacteria using antibiotic susceptibility and a multi-array electrochemical sensor with pattern recognition.
AB  - This work proposes the use of amperometric signals generated by a 96-well multi-array dissolved oxygen multi-electrode sensor (DOX) coupled with principal component analysis for continuous monitoring, identification and differentiation of bacteria. Two types of differentiation mechanisms were tested: (1) direct monitoring of respiratory activity via oxygen consumption and (2) quantification of the effect of three broad-spectrum antibiotics on bacteria growth and respiration over time. Five species of bacteria were examined including: Escherichia coli, Escherichia adecarboxylata, Comamonas acidovorans, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The addition of small concentrations of antibiotics to the growth medium alters the oxygen consumption of the cells and a unique fingerprint is created for a specific cell. This fingerprint is shown to evolve over a specific concentration range that is dependant of instrumental constraints of the DOX system. The application of principal component analysis (PCA) to classify the data was also examined. It was shown that bacteria could be classified simply by their oxygen consumption rates over a varying concentration range. Discrimination between species can also be increased by the effects of the antibiotics on the oxygen consumption of varying concentrations of cells. The proposed DOX-PCA system illustrates a generic template that can be tailored to meet specific research goals by the selection of specific cell/antibiotic combinations and concentrations.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing and fluorometric detection of proteins and microorganisms dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol) pyrenebutanoate.
AB  - The nonionogenic pyrene-based tenside, poly(ethylene glycol) pyrenebutanoate, was prepared and applied in capillary isoelectric focusing with fluorometric detection. This dye was used here as a buffer additive in capillary isoelectric focusing for a dynamic modification of the sample of proteins and microorganisms. The values of the isoelectric points of the labeled bioanalytes were calculated with use of the fluorescent pI markers and were found comparable with pI of the native compounds. The mixed cultures of proteins and microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, the strains of the yeast cells, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reproducibly focused and separated by the suggested technique. Using UV excitation for the on-column fluorometric detection, the minimum detectable amount was down to 10 cells injected on the separation capillary.
TI  - Expression of recombinant puroindolines for the treatment of staphylococcal skin  infections (acne vulgaris).
AB  - Puroindolines are antimicrobial peptides that occur in wheat seed, and are characterized by broad antimicrobial activity. We describe the heterologous expression of puroindoline A and B in the Origami strain of Escherichia coli. The recombinant puroindolines showed the same antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus epidermidis as compared to the native peptides (MIC(90)=30microgml(-1)). The bactericidal activity was 125microgml(-1) for recombinant puroindoline A and 42microgml(-1) for recombinant puroindoline B. Neither protein shows in vitro haemolytic activity or toxicity towards the murine macrophage cell line J774, but they are able to kill intracellular staphylococci. Our preliminary results suggest that recombinant puroindolines deserve further attention as alternatives to the conventional antibiotics in the control of S. epidermidis skin infections.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and in vitro biological studies of novel cyano derivatives of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine.
AB  - Cyano derivatives of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine have been synthesized and screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities. All the synthesized compounds showed the antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MTCCB 737), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCCB 741), Streptomyces epidermidis (MTCCB 1824) and Escherichia coli (MTCCB 1652) and antifungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus (ITCC 4517), Aspergillus flavus (ITCC 5192) and Aspergillus niger (ITCC 5405). All compounds showed mild to moderate antimicrobial activity. However, compounds 3c, 4a and 6 showed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains used in the study. Compounds 3a, 3b, 4b, and 4d showed mild to moderate antifungal activity against Aspergillus pathogenic strains. The compounds reported in this study were assessed for there cytotoxicity using MTT colorimetric assay on Hela cells. All the compounds showed cell viability more than the control drug gentamicin, with compound 2 having highest i.e. 95% cell viability.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and composition of the essential oil of Ziziphora clinopodioides subsp. bungeana (Juz.) Rech. f. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from the aerial flowering  parts of Ziziphora clinopodioides subsp. bungeana (Juz.) Rech. f. was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Thirty-two components representing 97.1% of the total oil were identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes (94.3%) were the predominant fraction of the oil with pulegone (65.2%), isomenthone (11.9%), 1,8-cineole (7.8%) and piperitenone (6.5%) as the main constituents. Antibacterial activity of the oil and also its two main components (pulegone and 1,8-cineole) were tested against seven bacteria. It was found that the oil exhibited interesting antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 3.75 mg/ml.
TI  - High-volume extraction of nucleic acids by magnetic bead technology for ultrasensitive detection of bacteria in blood components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid isolation, the most technically demanding and laborious  procedure performed in molecular diagnostics, harbors the potential for improvements in automation. A recent development is the use of magnetic beads covered with nucleic acid-binding matrices. We adapted this technology with a broad-range 23S rRNA real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for fast and sensitive detection of bacterial contamination of blood products. METHODS: We investigated different protocols for an automated high-volume extraction method based on magnetic-separation technology for the extraction of bacterial nucleic acids from platelet concentrates (PCs). We added 2 model bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, to a single pool of apheresis-derived, single-donor platelets and assayed the PCs by real-time RT-PCR analysis with an improved primer-probe system and locked nucleic acid technology. Co-amplification of human beta(2)-microglobulin mRNA served as an internal control (IC). We used probit analysis to calculate the minimum concentration of bacteria that would be detected with 95% confidence. RESULTS: For automated magnetic bead-based extraction technology with the real-time RT-PCR, the 95% detection limit was 29 x 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/L for S. epidermidis and 22 x 10(3) CFU/L for E. coli. No false-positive results occurred, either due to nucleic acid contamination of reagents or externally during testing of 1030 PCs. CONCLUSIONS: High-volume nucleic acid extraction improved the detection limit of the assay. The improvement of the primer-probe system and the integration of an IC make the RT-PCR assay appropriate for bacteria screening of platelets.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis).
AB  - An acidic polysaccharide CS-F2 from Camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - [Septic shock in patients with blood diseases. Analysis of clinical situation, treatment and outcome in sixty patients].
AB  - Septic shock is one of the major direct causes of death in patients in hematology departments. The aim of the study was to identify situations and factors associated with septic shock in patients with blood diseases. We analyzed the medical treatment of septic shock and its outcome, we based on data from clinical history. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analyzed group consisted of 60 patients with septic shock, 32 women and 28 men, aged between 20 and 79 years with different blood diseases, hospitalized between 1998 and 2004. RESULTS: Value of APACHE III scale (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation III scale) at the beginning of septic shock was statistically significantly higher for the non-survivors of septic shock than for the survivors (p < 0.001). Septic shock in the analyzed group was associated in similar proportion with presence of Gram-positive (the most often cultured: Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative bacteria (the most often cultured: Escherichia coli). The mortality due to septic shock caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms was also similar. We have found no differences in the mortality between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. If empirical treatment instituted at the beginning of shock was concordant with result of in vitro sensitivity testing received later, 81% of patients survived septic shock. The survival rate of patients with septic shock receiving discordant antimicrobial treatment was equal 11% and it was statistically less in comparison with patients, when the treatment was concordant (81% vs 11% p < 0.05). When the blood cultures were negative, the adequacy of antibiotic therapy was impossible to confirm and in this group 53% survival rate was noted (81% vs 53%, p < 0.05). In 37 cases, septic shock appeared in patients treated with antibiotics before the onset of septic shock. In this group of patients the highest percent of deaths was noted, when the antibiotic therapy after the moment of starting of septic shock was not changed and was higher in comparison to group, where the treatment was totally changed (64% vs 43% respectively, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors influencing survival in septic shock is patient's organ sufficiency and adequacy of applied antibiotics (early goal-directed antibiotic therapy)--in the same way the sensitivity of microorganisms to this treatment. The neutropenia didn't influence an outcome. The best results were achieved in patients whom combinations of three antibiotics were given: beta-lactam + aminoglicoside + glicopeptide antibiotic or carbapenem + glicopeptide antibiotic + fluorochinolon.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the fluorescence quantitative PCR assay targeting 16S rDNA].
AB  - The 16S rDNA specific primers were designed for rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) by the fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) assay, based upon multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the 16S rDNAs of over 20 bacteria. After extraction of PA genomic DNA, the target 16S rDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with specific primers, and used to construct recombinant pMDT-Pfr plasmid, the dilution gradients of which were subjected to the standard quantitation curve in FQ-PCR assay. Different concentrations of PA genomic DNA were detected by FQ-PCR in a 20microL of reaction system with SYBR Green I. At the same time, various genomic DNAs of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used as negative controls to confirm specificity of the FQ-PCR detection assay. Results demonstrated that the predicted amplified product of designed primers was of high homology only with PA 16S rDNA, and that sensitivity of the FQ-PCR assay was of 3.6pg/microL of bacterial DNA or (2.1 x 10(3) +/- 3.1 x 10(2)) copies/microL of 16S rDNA, accompanied with high specificity, and that the whole detection process including DNA extraction could be completed in about two hours. In contrast to traditional culture method, the FQ-PCR assay targeting 16S rDNA gene can be used to detect PA rapidly, which exhibits perfect application prospect in future.
TI  - The response of spleen dendritic cell-enriched population to bacterial and allogeneic antigens.
AB  - The dendritic cells (DC) play crucial role in initiation and modulation of immune response especially innate immune response. We investigated the influence bacterial (E. coli and S. epidermidis) and allogeneic antigens (heart, skin and bone marrow transplants) on splenic DC- enriched population. We found that 1) the in culture stimulation of rat splenic DC-enriched population by E. coli, S.epidermidis, LPS and CpG DNA caused increase in class II-positive cells. Simultaneously, a decrease in percentage of EDI, B cells and OX62 migrating DC upon treatment with S.epidermidis was observed. LPS caused decreased frequency of OX62 and NK cells. 2) Similarly to the in vitro the in vivo stimulation by E. coli, S.epidermidis, LPS and CpG DNA increased the percentage of class II-positive cells. There was a decrease in the ED1, OX62 and B cell populations following stimulation by S. epidermidis. 3) Mixed DC-enriched population and donor PBM culture showed high level of response in both populations. 4) Syngeneic and allogeneic transplants of heart, skin and BMC caused increase in class II-positive cells. Moreover, there was an increase in frequency of the ED1 and W3/13 populations after both syn- and allogeneic transplantation. The OX62 cells did not react, whereas the B cell frequency rose only after allogeneic transplantation. A significant decrease in NK cell population was noticed. 5) The in vitro and in vivo bacterial stimulation brought about expression of TLR receptors and Hsp. Mixed recipient DC with donor PBM culture caused expression of Hsp 90 but not TLRs. Allogeneic stimulation by transplanted tissues did not evoke expression of the investigated receptors and proteins. 6) Recipient DC-enriched population produced IFN gamma upon stimulation with bacteria and skin but not heart and BMC. Further studies on simultaneous stimulation of splenic DCs by bacterial and allo-antigens will throw light on additive effects of bacterial activation in allograft rejection.
TI  - Construction of a leftover bath water model for microbial testing.
AB  - In this study, in order to construct a model of leftover bath water, we analyzed  one hundred samples of used bath water samples which were provided by twenty-eight volunteer families. It appeared that the number of detected bacteria from such bath water was correlated closely with the number of bathers. Moreover, the pH, acidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ion, protein content of the leftover bath water were measured. The number of bathers had no connection with the pH, acidity, COD, and ion content of the leftover bath water. However, the protein content of the bath water correlated with the number of detected bacteria. Based on these results, the model of leftover bath water was constructed. Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with the model bath water as indices of bath water contamination. The number of incubated viable cells in the model bath water increased with increasing concentrations of casamino acid. Consequently, it was suggested that varying the concentration of casamino acid based on family size or contamination would be necessary in the efficient use of the constructed model of leftover bath water for microbial testing.
TI  - Pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones, inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  - A series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one inhibitors  of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) has been prepared. The 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones show low micromolar IC(50) values versus E. coli MurB and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus GC 1131, Enterococcus faecalis GC 2242, Streptococcus pneumoniae GC 1894, and E. coli GC 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. None of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. Moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by Streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. A partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving MurB potency and MIC values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the C-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one core. Docking studies using FLO and PharmDock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the MurB active site.
TI  - Antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS, ThyA) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for DNA synthesis. A specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. As a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a TS-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hTS). Docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward Lactobacillus casei TS and hTS. The best TS inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of Gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. Compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1H,3H-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC=0.5-2.5 microg/mL) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. So far this compound can be regarded as a leading antibacterial agent.
TI  - Studying bacterial metabolic states using Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - Natural metabolic variability expected during characteristic growth phases in batch cultures of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were studied by Raman spectroscopy. Spectral changes induced by metabolic changes found in the growth phases (i.e., lag, exponential, stationary, and decay) were identified. Maximum intensity of bands assigned to DNA and RNA bases are seen at the beginning of the exponential phase, when cells are metabolically active, and minimum intensities are seen when cells are decaying. High agreement in spectral variation due to growth phases was seen for all the trials that were performed, four growth cycles for E. coli and two for S. epidermidis. Batch cultures were monitored by standard plate counts to identify all growth phases, including decay. Spectral data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis to identify similarities and differences and to estimate a classification performance based on growth phases. For the species evaluated, spectra during decay are grouped closer to each other and separated from lag, exponential, and stationary cells. These results suggest that Raman spectroscopy can be used to study metabolic states in bacteria and in particular cell viability.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to surgical sutures: can antibacterial-coated sutures reduce  the risk of microbial contamination?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The role of surgical sutures in the etiology of surgical site infection has been the objective of discussion for decades. This study used a standardized in vitro microbiologic model to assess bacterial adherence and the antibacterial activity of a triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 (braided) suture against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates that may infect surgical wounds. STUDY DESIGN: Standardized cultures (2.0 log(10) colony forming units/mL and 5.0 log(10) colony forming units/mL of three clinical strains, Staphyllococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), S epidermidis (biofilm-positive) and Escherichia coli (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producer) were inoculated to triclosan-coated and noncoated polyglactin 910 sutures to evaluate comparative adherence of bacterial isolates to the antibacterial coated and noncoated surgical sutures; to assess the impact of serum proteins (bovine serum albumin) on antibacterial activity of triclosan-coated suture; and to document the duration of antibacterial activity of the triclosan-coated material. Selected suture samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy to demonstrate bacterial adherence. RESULTS: Substantial (p < 0.01) reductions in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial adherence were observed on triclosan-coated sutures compared with noncoated material. Pretreatment of surgical sutures with 20% BSA did not diminish antibacterial activity of the triclosan-coated braided device compared with noncoated suture (p < 0.01), and antibacterial activity was documented to persist for at least 96 hours compared with controls (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro model demonstrated a considerable reduction (p < 0.01) in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial adherence to a triclosan-coated braided suture, which was associated with decreased microbial viability (p < 0.001). Because bacterial contamination of suture material within a surgical wound may increase the virulence of a surgical site infection, treating the suture with triclosan provides an effective strategy for reducing perioperative surgical morbidity.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Effects of commensal bacteria on intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the gnotobiotic pig.
AB  - A germ-free neonatal pig model was established to determine the effects of bacterial colonization by different species on small intestinal morphology and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. Two experimental groups of 16 pigs were aseptically delivered by cesarian section and allocated into 4 gnotobiotic isolators. Pigs were either maintained germ-free (GF), or were orally inoculated with either a single strain of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (EC) or Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) or conventionalized with adult porcine feces (CV). After 13 days tissue samples were collected at 5 regions corresponding to 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of the small intestine (SI) length. In Experiment 2, the GF isolator became contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE). In general, intestinal responses to bacterial colonization were similar among GF, LF, and SE pigs, and intestinal responses in EC pigs were more similar to CV pigs. Responses to bacterial colonization were most pronounced in the distal SI regions (50%-95%), suggesting that nonmicrobial factors may be more important in the proximal SI. Relative to CV pigs, the distal intestines of GF, LF, and SE pigs were characterized by long villi, shallow crypts, increased relative intestinal mass, and decreased lamina propria cellularity, whereas SI morphology was intermediate in EC pigs. Relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta ) and IL-6 generally increased distally in the SI and was highest in EC and CV pigs. We observed regional variation in SI morphology and proinflammatory cytokine expression, which differed with bacterial species. This study demonstrates that bacterial species differentially affect intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and suggests that neonatal bacterial colonization patterns may have long-term effects on intestinal health and development.
TI  - Effect of gamma irradiation on viability and DNA of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Gamma irradiation is widely used for sterilization; however, its effect on elimination of amplifiable DNA, an issue of relevance to molecular diagnostic approaches, has not been well studied. The effect of gamma irradiation on the viability of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (using quantitative cultures) and on their DNA (using quantitative 16S rRNA gene PCR) was evaluated. Viability was abrogated at 2.8 and 3.6 kGy for S. epidermidis and E. coli, respectively. The radiation dose required to reduce viable bacteria by one log10 (D10 value) was 0.31 and 0.35 kGy for S. epidermidis and E. coli, respectively. D10 values for amplifiable DNA extracted from bacteria were 2.58 and 3.09 kGy for S. epidermidis and E. coli, respectively, whereas D10 values for amplifiable DNA were significantly higher for DNA extracted from irradiated viable bacterial cells (22.9 and 52.6 kGy for S. epidermidis and E. coli, respectively; P<0.001). This study showed that gamma irradiation of DNA in viable bacterial cells has little effect on amplifiable DNA, was not able to eliminate amplifiable 16S rRNA genes at a dose of up to 12 kGy and cannot therefore be used for elimination of DNA contamination of PCR reaction components or laboratory equipment when this DNA is present in microbial cells. This finding has practical implications for those using molecular diagnostic techniques in microbiology.
TI  - New trends in prosthesis infection in cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult cardiovascular surgery entails, in many cases, the use of some  kind of prosthesis. Among the potential complications, prosthetic device infection is one of the most devastating in incidence, as well as in prognosis and damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The most common bacterial agents in vascular and cardiac prosthetic device infections are Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis among gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The alternative modalities of treatment for prosthetic device infection encompass partial or total explantation of the prosthesis and its replacement with an infection-resistant graft (e.g., homologous tissue, autologous tissue, or synthetic prosthesis bonded with antibiotics).
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. Clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. METHODS: Non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the Phoenix system in 2003-2005. Epidemiologic data were extracted using Epicenter and Powerlab. During selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: The specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). Isolates of Escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally declined. Highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. A significant increase was seen in infections attributable to S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. The overall number of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. It appeared that the TEM-92 determinant moved from Enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.
TI  - Surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. We performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. METHODS: All procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. There were 155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. RESULTS: One patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by Staphylococcus schleiferi. The patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. One patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees C) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. One patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. A group A Streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. In the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus constellatus. No antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. CONCLUSION: In our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. Continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. Prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. Therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in the egg wax of the African cattle tick Amblyomma hebraeum (Acari: Ixodidae).
AB  - Eggs of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum Koch (Acari: Ixodidae) inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens (Gram-negative bacteria) in solid culture, but not the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and only marginally the growth of Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive bacteria). When egg wax was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), the extract contained antibacterial activity, but the denuded eggs did not. When assayed against bacteria in liquid culture, the aqueous phase inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis. However, the activity against E. coli was lost during extraction. The antimicrobial component of the aqueous phase was heat stable (100 degrees C for 10 min), resistant to proteinase K (15 min at 55 degrees C) and to pronase (30 min at 37 degrees C). The antibacterial activity in the aqueous phase increased the permeability of the cell membrane of susceptible bacterial cells within 30 min. However, lysis of the cells was detected by optical density measurements (OD(600 nm)) only after 1.5 h. The most evident cytological changes observed by transmission electron microscopy were a thickening of the cell wall and the appearance of numerous electron lucent areas within the cytoplasm of treated bacteria. Gene's organ, the egg-waxing organ in ticks, grew enormously during the first 16 days post-engorgement, and gained antimicrobial activity by day 10 (when oviposition began). This suggests that Gene's organ is the major source of the antibacterial substance in the egg wax. The vitellogenic hormone in A. hebraeum, 20-hydroxyecdysone, when injected into recently engorged females, did not stimulate growth of Gene's organ or precocious secretion of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Naturally processed dermcidin-derived peptides do not permeabilize bacterial membranes and kill microorganisms irrespective of their charge.
AB  - Dermcidin (DCD) is a recently described antimicrobial peptide, which is constitutively expressed in eccrine sweat glands and transported via sweat to the epidermal surface. By postsecretory proteolytic processing in sweat the dermcidin protein gives rise to several truncated DCD peptides which differ in length and net charge. In order to understand the mechanism of antimicrobial activity, we analyzed the spectrum of activity of several naturally processed dermcidin-derived peptides, the secondary structure in different solvents, and the ability of these peptides to interact with or permeabilize the bacterial membrane. Interestingly, although all naturally processed DCD peptides can adopt an alpha-helical conformation in solvents, they have a diverse and partially overlapping spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This indicates that the net charge and the secondary structure of the peptides are not important for the toxic activity. Furthermore, using carboxyfluorescein-loaded liposomes, membrane permeability studies and electron microscopy we investigated whether DCD peptides are able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. The data convincingly show that irrespective of charge the different DCD peptides are not able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. However, bacterial mutants lacking specific cell envelope modifications exhibited different susceptibilities to killing by DCD peptides than wild-type bacterial strains. Finally, immunoelectron microscopy studies indicated that DCD peptides are able to bind to the bacterial surface; however, signs of membrane perturbation were not observed. These studies indicate that DCD peptides do not exert their activity by permeabilizing bacterial membranes.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Automated detection and quantitation of bacterial RNA by using electrical microarrays.
AB  - Low-density electrical 16S rRNA specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. The pathogens are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. Interdigitated gold array electrodes (IDA-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold IDA as capture probes. They mediate the specific recognition of the target 16S rRNA by hybridization. Additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. They are supporting molecules, because they improve the RNA hybridization at the capturing site. A biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured RNA sequence. The biotin labels enable the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. The phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. The electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. The read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. If two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of the assays increase more than 60%. The limit of detection of Escherichia coli total RNA has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microL. The control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. The fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by PCR.
TI  - Microchip-based one step DNA extraction and real-time PCR in one chamber for rapid pathogen identification.
AB  - Optimal detection of a pathogen present in biological samples depends on the ability to extract DNA molecules rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, we report a novel method for efficient DNA extraction and subsequent real-time detection in a single microchip by combining laser irradiation and magnetic beads. By using a 808 nm laser and carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads, we demonstrate that a single pulse of 40 seconds lysed pathogens including E. coli and Gram-positive bacterial cells as well as the hepatitis B virus mixed with human serum. We further demonstrate that the real-time pathogen detection was performed with pre-mixed PCR reagents in a real-time PCR machine using the same microchip, after laser irradiation in a hand-held device equipped with a small laser diode. These results suggest that the new sample preparation method is well suited to be integrated into lab-on-a-chip application of the pathogen detection system.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide Akacid plus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. It was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this class with significantly less toxicity. The in vitro activity of Akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. METHODS: The organisms tested by CLSI reference methods included the following: Staphylococcus aureus (98), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Bacillus spp. (2), Enterococcus faecalis (32), Klebsiella spp. (45), Enterobacter spp. (20), Escherichia coli (65), Salmonella spp. (6), Shigella spp. (2), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Candida spp. (10) and Aspergillus spp. (7). In vitro selection of resistance to Akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. Toxicological analyses were also performed. RESULTS: All tested agents were more effective against Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. than against E. faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while MIC values of Akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant strains. Bactericidal action of Akacid plus was observed at 1-2x MIC. The in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in MIC values of Akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. In addition, Akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of Akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Activity of the major staphylococcal autolysin Atl.
AB  - The major autolysin of Staphylococcus aureus (AtlA) and of Staphylococcus epidermidis (AtlE) are well-studied enzymes. Here we created an atlA deletion mutant in S. aureus that formed large cell clusters and was biofilm-negative. In electron micrographs, the mutant cells were distinguished by rough outer cell surface. The mutant could be complemented using the atlE gene from S. epidermidis. To study the role of the repetitive sequences of atlE, we expressed in Escherichia coli the amidase domain encoded by the gene, carrying no repeat regions (amiE) or two repeat regions (amiE-R1,2), or the three repeat regions alone (R1,2,3) as N-terminal His-tag fusion proteins. Only slight differences in the cell wall lytic activity between AmiE and AmiE-R1,2 were observed. The repetitive sequences exhibit a good binding affinity to isolated peptidoglycan and might contribute to the targeting of the amidase to the substrate. AmiE and AmiE-R1,2 have a broad substrate specificity as shown by similar activities with peptidoglycan lacking wall teichoic acid, O-acetylation, or both. As the amidase activity of AtlA and AtlE has not been proved biochemically, we used purified AmiE-R1,2 to determine the exact peptidoglycan cleavage site. We provide the first evidence that the amidase indeed cleaves the amide bond between N-acetyl muramic acid and L-alanine.
TI  - Phenothiazinium-based photobactericidal materials.
AB  - Photosensitisers based on the phenothiazinium chromophore have been reported to be bactericidal on illumination via a singlet oxygen-mediated mechanism. The current work reports on the immobilisation of the methylene blue analogue, new methylene blue, in polymer resins, and the preliminary development of photobactericidal materials. The resultant materials exhibited measurable levels of singlet oxygen and were photobactericidal against both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Such materials may be of use in surface disinfection/infection control in the healthcare milieu.
TI  - [The effect of surface free energy parameters of diamond-like carbon films deposited on medical polyethylene terephthalate on bacterial adhesion].
AB  - Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were deposited by acetylene plasma immersion ion  implantation-deposition (PIII-D) on biomedical polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The capacities of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Escherichia coli (EC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Candida albicans (CA) for adhesion to PETs are quantitatively determined by the plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125I radio labeled bacteria in vitro. The results indicate that the capacities of five types of bacteria for adhesion to PETs are all suppressed by C2H2 PIII-D (P<0.05). The surface energy components of the various substrates and bacteria are calculated based on measurements in water, formamide and diiodomethane and Lifshitz-van del Waals/acid-base approach (LW-AB). The surface free energies obtained are used to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion (deltaF(adh)) of five kinds of bacteria on various substrates, and the results show that it is energetically unfavorable for bacterial adhesion to the DLC films already deposited on PET by C2H2 PIII-D.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiplasmid activities of essential oils.
AB  - The antimicrobial and antiplasmid activities of essential oils (orange oil, eucalyptus oil, fennel oil, geranium oil, juniper oil, peppermint oil, rosemary oil, purified turpentine oil, thyme oil, Australian tea tree oil) and of menthol, the main component of peppermint oil, were investigated. The antimicrobial activities were determined on the Gram (+) Staphylococcus epidermidis and the Gram (-) Escherichia coli F'lac K12 LE140, and on two yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 0425 delta/1 and 0425 52C strains. The antiplasmid activities were investigated on E. coli F'lac bacterial strain. Each of the oils exhibited antimicrobial activity and three of them antiplasmid action. The interaction of peppermint oil and menthol with the antibiotics was studied on the same bacterial strain with the checkerboard method. Peppermint oil and menthol displayed additive synergy with oxytetracycline. A new mechanism of plasmid curing was established for one of the oil components.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - [Clinical observation of the effects of FE combined enzymes on the infection of the granulation burn wound during late post burns stage].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of combined FE enzymes on the infection of the  granulation burn wound during late postburn stage in controlling burn wound infection caused by common antibiotic resistant bacteria. METHODS: Thirty patients in our burn ward were enrolled and were randomly divided into A [treated with combined FE enzymes (50 ml dissolved in 0-150 ml normal saline to reach the final concentration of 1-3 U/ml)] and B (treated with gentamicin) groups, with 15 patients in each group. Several layers of gauze, either soaked with combined FE enzyme in A or gentamicin in B group, were used to cover the burn wounds once to twice a day. Bacterial culture from the burn wound exudation before and after drug administration was done before the application of the agents. The bacteria in the burn wounds and their susceptibility to antibiotics were identified. The healing time of the burn wounds was recorded. Furthermore, the healing rate of the burn wound was recorded on the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th post skin grafting days (PSGD). RESULTS: The dominating bacteria in the burn wounds in both groups were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and MRSA. The susceptibility rate of bacteria ( MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyte, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) to combined FE enzyme was 93.8%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 95.0% respectively, which were much higher than those in B group (17.6%, 31.3%, 28.6%, 44.0%, 33.3%, 28.0% respectively, P < 0.1. The wound healing time after skin grafting in A group (10.6 +/- 1.5 days) was significantly shorter than that in B group (15.3 +/- 1.7 days, P < 0.01). The wound healing rate on 10 PSGD in A group was (85.4 +/- 2.4)%, and which was only (51.3 +/- 1.5% in B group (P < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Combined FE enzyme can effectively control burn wound infection, so that the interval between skin grafting and wound healing can be shortened and success rate of skin grafting be improved.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of GlmU enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  - The colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. We have developed an antibiofilm composition comprising an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (GlmU) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. The antibiofilm activity of GlmU inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (IDA), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and NEM analogs, including N-phenyl maleimide, N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (oPDM), and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PyrM), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. Both IDA and NEM inhibited biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. All NEM analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The combination of oPDM with protamine sulfate (PS) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microM. In addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters against P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. Confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. Thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a GlmU inhibitor and protamine sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activities of some medicinal plants from Cameroon.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of 10 plant species (Voacanga africana, Crepis cameroonica, Plagiostyles africana, Crotalaria retusa, Mammea africana, Lophira lanceolata, Ochna afzelii, Ouratea elongata, Ou. flava and Ou. sulcata), each of which is currently used in the traditional medicine of Cameroon, were investigated in vitro. The activities of a methanol extract of each plant were tested, in disc-diffusion assays, against 37 reference or laboratory strains of seven species of microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of each extract were then estimated, against each of the more susceptible microorganisms (i.e. those giving an inhibition zone measuring at least 9 mm in diameter in the disc-diffusion assays), by agar dilution. Although, in the disc-diffusion assays, each of the 10 methanol extracts investigated displayed some degree of antimicrobial activity against at least one species of microorganism, no activity against the Gram-negative bacteria (Es. coli, K. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa) was observed. The extract with the greatest antimicrobial activity was that of Pl. africana (Euphorbiaceae).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Gunshot-related transport of micro-organisms from the skin of the entrance region into the bullet path.
AB  - The skin defect of a gunshot entrance wound is caused by the retrograde and anterograde displacement of skin particles. In the present study, we investigated whether gunshots to bacterially contaminated skin are associated with the transport of micro-organisms into the bullet path. The shots were fired into composite models of pig skin and gelatin blocks. The outer surface of the skin was covered with a thin layer of a defined bacterial suspension [green fluorescent protein-labelled Escherichia coli in the preliminary test and Staphylococcus epidermidis, DSM 1798, in the main test series]. After the bacterially contaminated fluid had dried, test shots were fired from a distance of 5 and 10 m using calibre .38 Special cartridges with different bullet types (round nose, truncated cone, hollow point and flat nose). Subsequent bacteriological analyses showed that all the bullet tracks in the gelatin serving as tissue simulant contained displaced micro-organisms from the skin surface. The results are presented and discussed with reference to the transport of skin particles into the depth of the wound track.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Ethanol disinfection of plastic-adherent micro-organisms.
AB  - This study investigated the bactericidal effect of ethanol/water (70:30 vol:vol)  against plastic-adherent organisms that commonly cause line infections. The experiments were performed in polycarbonate wells and all incubations were at 37 degrees C. Bacteria in broth were inoculated into wells and incubated (16, 40 and 72 h) before washing to remove non-adherent organisms and exposure to ethanol/water. Wells were then re-incubated with broth to detect surviving bacteria. All organisms incubated for 16 h were killed by 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol. After incubation for 40 h, 4h of exposure to ethanol was required to kill two strains of Candida albicans. Likewise, one of three of both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, incubated for 72 h, showed growth after 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol but not after 4h of exposure. These results suggest that in contrast to log phase organisms, which are killed by ethanol/water solutions in seconds, plastic-adherent organisms are more resistant to the bactericidal activity of ethanol.
TI  - Novel antibiotics: C-2 symmetrical macrocycles inhibiting Holliday junction DNA binding by E. coli RuvC.
AB  - Holliday junctions (HJs) are formed as transient DNA intermediates during site-specific and homologous recombination. Both of these genetic exchange pathways are critical for normal DNA metabolism and repair. Trapping HJs leads to bacterial cell death by preventing proper segregation of the resulting interlinked chromosomes. Macrocyclic peptides designed to target this intermediate were synthesized with the goal of identifying compounds with specificity for this unique molecular target. We discovered ten macrocycles, both hexameric and octameric peptides, capable of trapping HJs in vitro. Those macrocycles containing tyrosine residues proved most effective. These data demonstrate that C-2 symmetrical macrocycles offer excellent synthetic targets for the development of novel antibiotic agents. Furthermore, the active compounds identified provide valuable tools for probing different pathways of recombinational exchange.
TI  - Bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in Africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. The reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in SS disease in Africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. METHODS: A study of blood cultures in 155 Ugandan children (165 episodes) with SS disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees C, attending the University Teaching Hospital in Kampala (Uganda, East Africa). RESULTS: Positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed Staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, Haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli and an unidentified Gram negative rod. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. CONCLUSION: The infrequent isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with SS disease in this study and in four other studies from Nigeria raises questions on a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. There are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. These data are necessary to determine its role in African children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial Africa.
TI  - Study of the efficacy of Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture (coated Polyglactin 910 suture with Triclosan) in two animal models of general surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy in vitro and in vivo of a new antibacterial  suture (PGAB) compared with a traditional braided suture (PG). Our primary goals were to study microbiological effectiveness and impact on wound healing of PGAB vs PG. Secondary goal was to analyze influence on inflammatory response. METHODS: In vitro study: clinical samples of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli were studied. We also implanted a flat mesh in 10 minipigs, four incisions each (two PG and two PGAB) two contaminated with S. epidermidis and two not contaminated. Finally, we performed four colic anastomosis in each of 10 minipigs, two contaminated with E. coli and two not contaminated (two PG and two PGAB). We studied the inflammatory and wound healing processes in both models. RESULTS: We observed a bactericidal efficacy of PGAB against grampositive, and bacteriostatic effect against E. coli. Mesh study: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs PG. In the group PGAB, inflammatory mediators' concentrations were lower. In the group PGAB, concentrations of wound healing mediators were normal. Colic anastomosis: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs the group PG. In the group PGAB we observed a reduction of inflammatory mediators. In the group PGAB we observed normalized concentrations of wound healing mediators. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates microbiological efficacy of PGAB, that normalizes wound healing process, and an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to 35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Clarithromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of clarithromycin metal complexes has been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of clarithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium has been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with clarithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition. of complexes against both gram negative and gram positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhii, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentary, Kelebcilla pneumoni and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of clarithromycin complexes results in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of clarithromycin increases with respect to parent clarithromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Roxithromycin antagonism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of roxithromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of roxithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with roxithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of roxithromycin complexes results in antagonistic behavior against few microorganisms where in MIC is increased with respect to the parent drug, while against most of the microorganism, there was no effect on the MIC of the roxithromycin metal complexes with respect to parent roxithromycin.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of Diplotaenia damavandica.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from leaves, root and the seeds of Diplotaenia damavandica Mozaffarian, Hedge & Lamond, an endemic plant to Iran, was determined against 10 microorganisms using the disk susceptibility test as well as measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations. The results showed that all three oils had antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. The essential oil from the leaves had the highest antimicrobial activity against all test microorganisms including the fungal strains. The essential oils compositions were analyzed and determined by GC and GC-MS. The oils analyses resulted in the identification of 16, 17 and 20 compounds representing 94.2%, 96.4% and 95.1% of the total oils, respectively. The main components of the leaf essential oils were (Z)-beta-ocimene (21.6%), alpha-phellandrene (21.3%) and terpinolene (20%). Dill apiol (30.1%) and gamma-terpinene (16.2%) were the main components of the root and seed essential oils, respectively.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Biofilm formation by Escherichia coli is stimulated by synergistic interactions and co-adhesion mechanisms with adherence-proficient bacteria.
AB  - Laboratory strains of Escherichia coli do not show significant ability to attach  to solid surfaces and to form biofilms. We compared the adhesion properties of the E. coli PHL565 laboratory strain to eight environmental E. coli isolates: only four isolates displayed adhesion properties to glass significantly higher than PHL565. The ability of the adhesion-proficient isolates to attach to glass tubes strongly correlated with their ability to express curli (thin aggregative fimbriae), thus suggesting that curli are a common adhesion determinant in environmental strains. Despite its inability to attach to solid surfaces, growth of E. coli PHL565 in mixed cultures with Pseudomonas putida MT2 resulted in co-adhesion and in formation of a mixed E. coli/P. putida biofilm, which was able to colonize glass surfaces with dramatic efficiency compared to P. putida alone. E. coli/P. putida interactions stimulate initial adhesion to glass, and the presence of both bacterial species in the mature biofilm was confirmed by quantitative PCR. In contrast, no synergistic biofilm formation was observed in mixed cultures of E. coli with the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis. Interestingly, E. coli PHL565 also stimulated biofilm formation by bacterial communities isolated from drinking water distribution systems. Our results strongly suggest that co-adhesion and synergistic interaction with biofilm-forming species might represent an important mechanism, and a possible alternative strategy to production of adhesion determinants, for persistence and propagation of E. coli in the environment.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity and QSAR studies of 1,2-disubstituted-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.
AB  - Some new substituted-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard Gram positive and Gram negative strains: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (WHO-6), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), 1-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 4a-c proved to be effective with MIC 3.5-20 (microg ml(-1)). Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies with multiple linear regression analysis were applied to find correlation between different calculated molecular descriptors of the synthesized compounds and biological activity.
TI  - Determination of the antimicrobial properties of oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde.
AB  - Oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (OHNA) was synthesized by oxidative polycondensation using H2O2 (35%, aqueous solution), air O2 and NaOCl (34%, aqueous solution) by Kaya and Senol and the products were characterized by spectral techniques. Antimicrobial activities of the first and second fractions of OHNA were tested against Corynobacterium xerosis CCM 2824, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6897, Staphylococcus epidermidis NRRL B-4877, S. aureus ATCC 6538, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Salmonella thyphimurium CCM 5445, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, E. coli ATCC 23998, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, B. cereus ATCC 99, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Yersinia spp., Neisseria canis, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces fragilis NRRL 2415, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763, S. ovarum, Debaryomyces hensenii, Hansenula anamola, Candida albicans, C. utilis, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigates, A. versicolor, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium granulatum, P. chrysogenum, and P. herque. OHNA demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and yeast, but did not affect filamentous fungi.
TI  - Multiarray sensors with pattern recognition for the detection, classification, and differentiation of bacteria at subspecies and strain levels.
AB  - This work describes the integration of a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor with pattern recognition techniques for the detection and classification of bacteria at subspecies and strain level. The system provides a continuous, real-time monitoring of bacteria activity upon exposure to antibiotics. The system utilizes 96-well-type electrodes array (DOX-dissolved oxygen sensor) with principal component analysis (PCA) for rapid and routine classification of different classes of bacteria and related strains. A representative sample of a section of the bacteria kingdom has been analyzed and classified using the proposed DOX-PCA system, including the following: Corynebacterium glutamicum, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Yersinia ruckeri, Escherichia adecarboxylata, Comamonas acidovorans, Alcaligenes odorans, Bacillus globigii, and three strains of Escherichia coli (K12, SM10, ATCC 25922). The new classification scheme is based on the hypothesis that, under identical experimental conditions, various bacteria consume oxygen at different rates and are affected in different ways by selected antibiotics. Thus, the response of the individual electrode in the array is indirectly altered, compared to that of cells growing on medium, by the addition of the antibiotic. By using three different antibiotics in separate wells, a unique fingerprint can be created for a specific bacterium. With the proposed DOX-PCA system, classification of bacteria was achieved at subspecies and strain level in real time. This study represents a basic research tool that may allow researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and classify bacteria type at subspecies and strain levels.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Listeria monocytogenes and Aspergillus niger. Evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  - The evaluation of the microbiological charge present in Costa Rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. The microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in Costa Rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. Also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of Clostridium botulinum. For the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in Muller Hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger. The results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) CFU/g. No positive result was obtained for the isolation of C. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of S. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, A. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Raman spectroscopy and chemical imaging for quantification of filtered waterborne bacteria.
AB  - Rapid and reliable assessment of pathogenic microbial contamination in water is critically important. In the present work we evaluated the suitability of Raman Spectroscopy and Chemical Imaging as enumeration techniques for waterborne pathogens. The prominent C-H stretching band observed between 2800-3000 cm(-1) of the spectrum is used for quantification purposes. This band provides the highest intensity of the bacterial-spectrum bands facilitating the detection of low number of microorganisms. The intensity of the Raman response correlates with number of cells present in drops of sample water on aluminum-coated slides. However, concentration of pathogens in drinking and recreational water is low, requiring a concentration step, i.e., filtering. Subsequent evaluation of filtering approaches for water sampling for Raman detection showed significant background signal from alumina and silver membranes that reduces method sensitivity. Samples concentrated by filtration show good correlation between Raman spectroscopy and other quantification methods including turbidity (R(2)=0.92), plate counts (R(2)=0.87) and dry weight (R(2)=0.97). Background interferences did not allow for evaluation of this relationship at low cell concentrations.
TI  - Efficient growth inhibition of Bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. One potential key enzyme of B. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. It provides deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. We have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying NrdF component of B. anthracis class Ib ribonucleotide reductase. Its EPR spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of C(alpha)-(C(beta)-C(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. The unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. We show that B. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an antiproliferative drug, even though its NrdF radical is efficiently scavenged in vitro. Importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and N-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent B. anthracis growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. Phylogenetically, the B. anthracis NrdF protein clusters together with NrdFs from the pathogens Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We suggest the potential use of N-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by B. anthracis and closely related pathogens.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal effects of soft contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  - AIMS: To study the antibacterial and antifungal effects of soft contact lens disinfection solutions. METHODS: Eight contact lens disinfection solutions containing hydrogen peroxide or biguanides or polyquad compounds were evaluated with respect to their ability to disinfect a saline solution experimentally contaminated with different bacteria and with a fungus. We used cultures in blood Agar, MuellerHinton agar and Saboureaud's agar to identify the bacterial and fungal growth following 14 h of exposure to the disinfection solutions. RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide, DYMED and polyhexamide solutions prevented the growth of the four bacteria studied. The solution containing biguanide prevented the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The solution with polyquad solution only prevented the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and none of the disinfection solutions prevented the growth of Candida albicans. The control solution, which was saline, did not prevent the growth of either bacteria or fungi. CONCLUSIONS: Disinfection solutions containing hydrogen peroxide, or DYMED or polyhexamide can disinfect these four bacteria but none of them prevented the growth of Candida albicans.
TI  - A study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. Multiple site cultures may improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. We hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. DESIGN/METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis. A minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. Based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. RESULTS: A total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. In all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. In all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. All neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. The other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. The single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by Listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3), combined MRSA and Candida albicans (2), Candida albicans alone (2), late-onset Group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Enterococcus fecalis (1), Escherichia coli (1), and Serratia marcescens (1). Since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. CONCLUSIONS: Two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. Sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood volume of>or=1 ml.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine derivatives.
AB  - A series of substituted piperazine derivatives have been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (MTCCB 737), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCCB 741), Streptomyces epidermidis (MTCCB 1824) and Escherichia coli (MTCCB 1652), and antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. All synthesized compounds showed significant activity against bacterial strains but were found to be less active against tested fungi. In vitro toxicity tests demonstrated that compounds 4d and 6a showed very less toxicity against human erythrocytes.
TI  - Detection of potentially novel bacterial components of the human skin microbiota  using culture-independent molecular profiling.
AB  - Although the micro-organisms forming the cutaneous microbiota are considered to play important roles in the modification and prevention of skin diseases, a comprehensive analysis of their composition has not yet been carried out because of difficulties in determining yet-to-be-cultured micro-organisms in the samples. Swab-scrubbed forehead skin samples of five healthy volunteers were analysed by profiling 16S rRNA genes, as well as by conventional culture methods, to provide a profile of the cutaneous microbiota that included yet-to-be-cultured bacteria from normal human skin. Cluster analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated a marked increase in diversity compared with that derived from the culture methods. Nineteen previously recognized species and 13 novel phylotypes were obtained from the analysis of 416 clones. In addition to well-known bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, phylotype A, the 16S rRNA gene of which is 97 % similar to that of Methylophilus methylotrophus, was detected in three of the five samples, in one of which it was the predominant clone. Culture-independent genetic profiling of 16S rRNA genes for detecting human cutaneous microbiota has allowed us to detect potentially novel components of the cutaneous microbiota in humans.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - N,N-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  - The biogenous antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine (NCT) converts by disproportionation to N,N-dichlorotaurine (NDCT) at a rate proportional to acidity. This occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. To understand the consequences of NDCT formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. Differently from NCT, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. While the free acid, Cl(2)HNCH(2)CH(2)SO(3)H, was not available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees C (potassium) and 162-164 degrees C (sodium). The sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). The aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than NCT. With regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation), NDCT was, surprisingly, less efficacious than NCT, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at pH < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. Compared on a molar scale, NDCT was more bactericidal than NCT against the gram-negative bacteria E. coli, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The increase of bactericidal activity at acidic pH was the same as observed with NCT and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. Taken together, NDCT seems not to be suited to substitute NCT as a preparation fit for medical practice.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of Ag nanoparticle loaded multilayers and formation of magnetically directed antibacterial microparticles.
AB  - Antibacterial coatings based on hydrogen-bonded multilayers containing in situ synthesized Ag nanoparticles were created on planar surfaces and on magnetic colloidal particles. We report the antibacterial properties of these coatings, determined using a disk-diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) test, as a function of the film thickness and the concentration of Ag nanoparticles in the hydrogen-bonded multilayers. The zone of inhibition (ZoI) determined by the disk-diffusion test increases as the thickness of the multilayer film is increased. Results obtained for the values of the ZoI as a function of film thickness can be described adequately with a simple diffusion model (i.e., the square of the zone of inhibition (ZoI) depended linearly on the logarithm of the thickness of the silver-loaded films). This observation suggests that, in order to incrementally increase the ZoI, an exponentially increasing amount of Ag is required within the multilayers. In general, there was no statistically significant correlation between the zone of inhibition and the number of Ag loading and reduction cycles. The duration of sustained release of antibacterial Ag ions from these coatings, however, could be prolonged by increasing the total supply of zerovalent silver in the films via multiple loading and reduction cycles. These results indicate that the release of silver is controlled by an oxidation mechanism at the surface of the nanoparticles and that repeated loading and reduction of silver leads preferentially to growth of the existing silver nanoparticles in the film as opposed to nucleation of new Ag nanoparticles. We also show that magnetic microspheres coated with silver nanoparticle loaded hydrogen-bonded multilayer thin films can be used to deliver antibacterial agents to specific locations. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nanocomposite coated microspheres was determined by the agar dilution technique: antibacterial magnetic microspheres with higher concentrations of Ag nanoparticles exhibited lower MIC values.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of bacteria isolated from patients with chronic sinusitis (CR) and antibiotic-resistance. METHODS: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 76 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi, then the antimicrobial susceptibility test and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (beta-LPB) were detected. In the control group, the discharges from the nasal cavity from 10 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. RESULTS: Twenty species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-Hemolytic streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of aerobe, anaerobe, gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 83.4%, 16.6%, 56.3% and 43.7%, respectively. The fungi was only detected in 1.4% patients. The antimicrobial susceptibility test demonstrated that Imipenem, Cefotaxime and Amoxicillin-clavulanate were good in vitro activity to aerobic pathogens and Metronidazole, Imipenem and Chloramphenicol was good to anaerobic pathogens. The beta-LPB was detected in 37.7% strains in which Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-Hemolytic streptococcus and Branhamella catarrhalis were more frequent. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli etc were cultured from the control group. There was no significant difference of distribution of the same bacteria between the control group and the testing group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic bacteria of CR mostly involve aerobes. The antibiotics-resistance of these pathogen is serious. The bacterial infection plays no leading role in CR, so the need of antibiotics should not be excessively emphasized. Before treatment by antibiotics, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be performed. The broad-spectrum antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor such as Cefotaxime and Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended in condition that the test can not be finished.
TI  - Identification of immunogenic and serum binding proteins of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal of human skin and a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Limited information is available about S. epidermidis proteins that are expressed upon transition to the bloodstream or those involved in host-pathogen interactions. A cell surface fraction from S. epidermidis 0-47 grown in rabbit serum to mimic environmental signals encountered during a bloodstream infection was separated by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Following 2D separation, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with either pooled sera generated in rabbits immunized with live S. epidermidis 0-47 or with biotin-labeled serum proteins eluted from the surface of bacteria grown in rabbit serum. Twenty-nine immunoreactive or serum binding proteins of S. epidermidis were identified by mass spectrometry. Twenty-seven of the corresponding genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant proteins were used to immunize mice. In a preliminary screen, 12 of the 27 recombinant proteins induced a response that reduced the number of bacteria recovered from the spleen or bloodstream of infected mice. In subsequent vaccination studies, 5 of the 12 proteins resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of bacteria. The identification of five candidate vaccine antigens from the initial screen of only 29 proteins demonstrates the utility of this approach.
TI  - Influence of human ascitic fluid on the in vitro antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro influence of HAF on the antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against Escherichia coli ATCC 10798, Escherichia coli K-12, Proteus rettgeri (Sanelli), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 1808 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Human ascitic fluid was obtained from 6 cirrhotic patients by paracentesis. The interaction effect was evaluated by the checkerboard technique. Our results indicate the ability of human ascitic fluid to reduce minimum inhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, but not against Gram-positives.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Recombinant expression of indolicidin concatamers in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates. They are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Currently, most antimicrobial peptides are extracted from host organisms or produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is a tool for greater production yields at a decreased cost and reduces the use of hazardous materials. We have constructed a concatamer of indolicidin and successfully expressed a fusion product with thioredoxin in E. coli BL21DE3. Codons for methionine residues flanking individual indolicidin genes were incorporated for cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and liberation of active monomeric indolicidin. Peptide yields of 150 microg/l monomeric indolicidin were achieved in this first report of recombinant production of indolicidin with demonstrated antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Implications of the changing pattern of bacterial infections following total joint replacements.
AB  - PURPOSE: To retrospectively review the causative organisms isolated from infected hip and knee replacements requiring revision. METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive series of 36 patients who underwent revision hip or knee arthroplasties due to bacterial infection at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Hong Kong between 1995 and 2003. The male to female ratio was 1:2, and the mean age of patients was 70 years (range, 54-82 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 1.1-8.3 years). No patient was lost to follow-up. All 14 revision knee patients had previously undergone cemented and patella-resurfacing total knee arthroplasties. Of the 22 revision hip patients, 9 had cementless, 6 had cemented, and 7 had hybrid total hip arthroplasties previously. RESULTS: None of the bacteria isolated from 1995 to 1996 were multiple-drug resistant. Subsequently, however, most of the isolates were multiple-drug resistant, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) being the most common. Half of the isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli demonstrated multiple-drug resistance. The incidence of positive culture in revision hip patients was 59%, 46% of which were MRSA. All 13 revision hips with positive cultures showed chronic sepsis: 4 occurred within one year and 10 occurred 2 or more years after the index arthroplasty. The incidence of positive culture in revision knee patients was 57%, 46% of which were MRSA. All 8 revision knees with positive cultures showed chronic sepsis: 3 occurred within one year, 5 occurred 2 or more years after the index arthroplasty. Only one patient, who was infected with gram-negative bacilli, required a second revision for residual sepsis. Harris hip scores for the revision hip patients improved from a mean of 65 (range, 55-75) to 85 (range, 75-90). Knee Society knee scores of the revision knee patients improved from a mean of 68 (range, 55-75) to 80 (range, 70-85). There were no radiological signs suggestive of loosening in the 2 groups at the latest follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study found a definite increase in multiple-drug-resistant bacteria isolated from periprosthetic infections around total hip and knee prostheses.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of MSI-78 alone and in combination with antibiotics against bacteria responsible for bloodstream infections in neutropenic patients.
AB  - MSI-78 is a 22 amino acid amphipathic peptide with potent antimicrobial activity  against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, we assessed the in vitro activity of MSI-78 alone and in combination with eight clinically used antimicrobial agents against several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli isolated from blood of neutropenic febrile patients. Antimicrobial activity of MSI-78 was measured by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), time-kill studies and checkerboard titration method. The Gram-negative isolates were susceptible to the peptide at concentrations in the range 0.50-16 mg/L, while staphylococci showed lower susceptibility. MSI-78 demonstrated a higher antimicrobial activity than colistin against Gram-negative organisms. The checkerboard titration method demonstrated synergy when the peptide was combined with beta-lactams. These results provide evidence for the potential use of MSI-78 in the management of severe infections in neutropenic patients.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of a silane quaternary ammonium salt as an antimicrobial surface treatment.
AB  
TI  - Tetrasodium EDTA as a novel central venous catheter lock solution against biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infections (BSIs) are known to increase rates of morbidity and mortality in both inpatients and outpatients, including hematology-oncology patients and those undergoing hemodialysis or home infusion therapy. Biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium EDTA as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. METHODS: Biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(-1) on CVC segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium EDTA lock treatment. RESULTS: Comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg/mL(-1) tetrasodium EDTA lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (P < .05) after exposure to the treatment. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg/mL(-1) of tetrasodium EDTA for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate CVC-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Evaluation of CD4(+)/CD8(+) status and urinary tract infections associated with urinary schistosomiasis among some rural Nigerians.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on urinary schistosomiasis in Nigeria are mainly epidemological. The knowledge of co-infections of urinary schistosomiasis and other pathogens are important epidemiological tools for the control and health benefits of the rural dwellers. The granulomatous reactions in urinary schistosomiasis is CD4(+) dependent. The CD8(+) is cytotoxic to parasites and it is activated by CD4(+). These parameters therefore participate in the immune responses to urinary schistosomiasis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the polyparasitism involving urinary schistosomiasis and urinary tract co - infections among some rural Nigerians. The CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio and status with age groups in years were also investigated. METHODS: Parasitological investigation using ova on urine was carried out on 216 volunteers. The urine samples were examined for bacteriuria and subsequently subjected to standard microbiological urine culture. CD4(+)/CD8(+) were determined using the CD T 4 Dynabead techniques. Data were analysed using MicroSoft Excel. RESULTS: The inhabitants with light infections of urinary schistosomiasis as indicated by <50 ova /10 ml of urine had a mean CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio of 1.57 while those with heavy infections as shown by >50 ova/10 ml of urine had a relatively lower CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio of 1.03. In all, the overall CD4+:CD8+ ratio of 1.23 was recorded with the mean CD4+ count of 257.96 cells/microL and the mean CD8(+) count of 210.45 cells/microL. Comparatively, the control uninfected subjects had a CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio of 5.97. The CD4(+) and the CD8(+) counts were correlated with the ova of S. haematobium in their urine samples at r = 0.0108 and r = 0.516 respectively. The bacteriuria, urinary schistosomiasis and urinary tract co-infections, namely: Escherichia coli, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. Saprophyticus were reported in the urine cultures of 48(22.0%) volunteers. CONCLUSION: The mean overall CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio of urinary schistosomiasis infected persons is 1.23 which is above the normal CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio of 1. The CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio and counts of the urinary schistosomiasis infected inhabitants were lower than the uninfected inhabitants. The positive correlation between the CD4(+):CD8(+) and the S. haematobium ova shows a relationship which indicate an increase of the CD4(+):CD8(+) as the intensity of infection increases. We report polyparasitism of S. haematobium and urinary tracts co-infections among some rural inhabitants in Ikpeshi, Nigeria. It is therefore imperative to incorporate the management of urinary tract infections in urinary schistosomiasis control programme.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of bacterial sepsis with PCR amplification and microarray hybridization in 16S rRNA gene.
AB  - In this study, blood culture and PCR-microarray analysis were used to examine 172 cases of suspected septicemia. Primers and oligonucleotide probes, based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene, were arrayed by imprinting on microarray slides. Blood specimens collected from 172 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and then tested separately by PCR for the bacterial 16S rRNA. Of the 172 clinical cases, 17 cases tested positive by PCR. The number of positives identified by PCR (9.88%) was significantly higher than the number of positives identified by the blood culture (4.65%). When blood culture was used as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100%, the specificity was 97.85%, and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.979. When the 17 PCR positive specimens were further analyzed by hybridization against the microarrays, five were found to be probe positive for E. coli, four were positive for S. epidermidis, four were positive for CoNS, and two were positive for Bacillus and Propionibacterium, respectively. In the eight specimens showing positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the species determined by microarray analysis corresponded with the result obtained from blood culture. Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by PCR and microarray analysis can be used to accurately diagnose neonatal sepsis. This method has a higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of clonidine and neostigmine in vitro.
AB  - We conducted an in vitro study to investigate the antibacterial activity of clonidine and neostigmine on common microorganisms encountered during infectious complications after regional anesthesia. Standardized suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were incubated during 1, 3, 6, and 24 h at 37 degrees C with concentrations of 37.5, 75, and 150 microg/mL of clonidine and 125, 250, and 500 microg/mL of neostigmine. After 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C, the colony counts were compared by two-way analysis of variance. The mean colony counts for S. aureus decreased significantly from control as the exposure to clonidine increased (P < 0.05), with a approximately 100% kill at 6 h for the largest concentration (150 microg/mL) and at 24 h for the intermediate concentration (75 microg/mL). Similar results were observed for S. epidermidis, with a approximately 100% kill at 6 h for the largest concentrations (75 and 150 microg/mL). No bactericidal activity of clonidine was observed for E. coli and no bactericidal activity of neostigmine was observed for any of the tested strains. In the conditions of this experiment, clonidine, but not neostigmine, exhibited a concentration-dependent and time-dependent bactericidal activity in vitro on the microorganisms most frequently encountered in infectious complications after regional anesthesia.
TI  - Structure--antimicrobial activity of some natural isocoumarins and their analogues.
AB  - Three naturally occurring isocoumarins (paepalantine, paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-allopyranosyl(1 --> 6) glucopyranoside) and two semi-synthetic analogues, 9,10-acylated compound and 9-OH-10-methylated compound, structurally similar to paepalantine, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using a spectrophotometric microdilution technique. The paepalantine was active against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis while the other four compounds proved ineffective against all microorganisms tested at concentrations of 500 microg/ml. Variations in phenolic substitution at OH-9 and/or OH-10 in the paepalantine molecule resulted in compounds without antimicrobial activity. A combination of structural features, two phenolic groups as cathecolic system, forms an oxygenated system arrangement that may reflect the potentially antimicrobial properties of paepalantine.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of test stimulation leads during percutaneous nerve stimulation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the bacterial contamination of conventional percutaneous nerve stimulation (PNE) leads. Sacral neuromodulation has become an important tool for the treatment of urgency and chronic retention. Patients likely to benefit from this type of therapy are identified by PNE testing before implantation of the definitive system. Recently, a new system was introduced, using a self-blocking electrode that remains in place for both PNE testing and final implantation. PNE testing warrants an extracorporeal stimulator. Thus, using the same electrode for both external stimulation and definitive implantation may carry a significant risk of infection. METHODS: Bilateral PNE testing was performed in 11 consecutive patients (8 women and 3 men, mean age 41.6 years) for either urgency (n = 7) or chronic retention (n = 4). Electrodes were placed under aseptic conditions and stimulated for 3 days. At the end of each test, the electrodes were removed and evaluated microbiologically. RESULTS: In 5 of the 11 patients (9 of 22 leads), significant bacterial growth was detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis in 5, Escherichia coli in 3, and Enterococcus faecalis in 1. However, no patient showed signs of inflammation at the electrode insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial growth was found in 45.5% of the patients after conventional PNE testing under aseptic conditions. Therefore, the new electrodes may well carry an elevated risk of infection. Infection of the implant can lead to major surgical revision or even explantation. Thus, additional studies of the infection risk of this new electrode are warranted before its general use can be recommended.
TI  - Vascular graft infections: in vitro and in vivo investigations of a new vascular  graft with long-term protection.
AB  - We investigated a polyester vascular prosthesis (PET) coated with elemental silver (SC). Measurement of silver release over a period of 52 weeks by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry of PET with (PET-G) and without (PET-N) gelatine impregnation revealed a silver release on the first day of 1.2 +/- 0.2 microg (PET-N) and 1.2 +/- 0.1 microg (PET-G) (calculated for 1 g of prosthesis); from the 90th day onward, it was between 0.22 +/- 0.14 microg (PET-N) and 0.18 +/- 0.12 microg (PET-G) per day. The prostheses were incubated with Staphylococcus aureus (S.a.), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.e.), or Escherichia coli (E.c.) to investigate in vitro antibacterial efficacy. After 6 h of incubation, no colony-forming units were to be seen for any of the bacterial suspensions for PET with SC (p < 0.001). To investigate in vivo antibacterial efficacy, PET-G rings with and without SC contaminated with S.a., S.e., or E.c. were implanted in 18 albino rabbits and examined 7 days after agar culture for 48 h. The silver coating was associated with a significant reduction in bacterial growth (S.a., p = 0.001; S.e., p < 0.005; E.c., p < 0.001). The silver-coated prosthesis, with and without gelatine impregnation, had a significantly antibacterial effect with continuous release of silver.
TI  - A novel peptide screened by phage display can mimic TRAP antigen epitope against  Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen. Pathogenic effects are largely due to production of bacterial toxins, whose synthesis is controlled by an mRNA molecule termed RNAIII. The S. aureus protein called RAP (RNAIII-activating protein) is secreted and activates RNAIII production by inducing the phosphorylation of its target protein TRAP (target of RAP). Antibodies to TRAP have been shown to suppress exotoxin production by S. aureus in vitro, suggesting that TRAP may be a useful vaccine target site. Here we showed that a peptide TA21 was identified by screening a phage display library using anti-TRAP antibodies. Mice vaccinated with Escherichia coli engineered to express TA21 on their surface (FTA21) were protected from S. aureus infections, using sepsis and cellulitis mice models. By sequence analysis, it was found that the TA21 is highly homologous to the C-terminal sequence of TRAP which is conserved among S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that peptide TA21 may be a useful broad vaccine to protect from infection caused by various staphylococcal strains.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - Correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and hydrophobicities represented as RP HPLC retention times.
AB  - PTP7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretions of Rana rugosa. In order to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of PTP7 derivatives were constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. We found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of antimicrobial peptides. The mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) retention time. The observed hydrophobicity represented as RP HPLC retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane and Gram positive bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. However, antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, did not show correlation with RP HPLC retention time. These data indicate that the RP HPLC retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of polymeric soybean oil-g-methyl methacrylate (and n-butyl methacrylate) graft copolymers: biocompatibility and bacterial adhesion.
AB  - Peroxidation, epoxidation, and/or perepoxidation reactions of soybean oil under air at room temperature resulted in cross-linked polymeric soybean oil peroxides on the surface along with the waxy soluble part, sPSB, with a molecular weight of 4690, containing up to 2.3 wt % peroxide. This soluble polymeric oil peroxide, sPSB, initiated the free radical polymerization of either methyl methacrylate (MMA) or n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA) to give PSB-g-PMMA and PSB-g-PnBMA graft copolymers. The polymers obtained were characterized by (1)H NMR, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and gel permeation chromatography techniques. Polymeric oil as a plasticizer lowered the glass transition of the PSB-g-PMMA graft copolymers. PSB-g-PMMA and PSB-g-PnBMA graft copolymer film samples were also used in cell culture studies. Fibroblast and macrophage cells were strongly adhered and spread on the copolymer film surfaces, which is important in tissue engineering. Bacterial adhesion on PSB-g-PMMA graft copolymer was also studied. Both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli adhered on the graft copolymer better than on homo-PMMA. Furthermore, the latter adhered much better than the former.

TI  - Evidence of a charge-density threshold for optimum efficiency of biocidal cationic surfaces.
AB  - The deposition of organic monolayers containing quaternary ammonium groups has been shown by many authors to confer biocidal properties on a large variety of solid surfaces. In a search for the controlling factors, the authors have grafted quaternized poly(vinylpyridine) chains on glass surfaces by two different methods and varied the charge density within the organic layer between 10(12) and 10(16) positive charges per cm2. The measurements show that this parameter has a large influence on the killing efficiency. Bacterial death occurs in less than 10 min in the quiescent state above a threshold value. The value is smaller for bacteria in the growth state. It also depends on the bacterial type. An electrostatic mechanism based on the exchange of counterions between the functionalized cationic surface and the bacterial membrane is proposed and appears consistent with the results.
TI  - The product of the qacC gene of Staphylococcus epidermidis CH mediates resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We have characterized a natural isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to heavy metals that carries a small 2391-bp plasmid, pSepCH, encoding the qacC gene. The S. epidermidis qacC gene confers resistance to a number of beta-lactam antibiotics and to ethidium bromide in its natural host and in Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. This is the first communication of a small multidrug resistance (SMR) pump involved in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Experiments using tolC, ompW and ompD mutant strains of S. Typhimurium demonstrated that the beta-lactam antibiotic resistance conferred by this pump does not depend on these outer membrane proteins.
TI  - [The most frequent bacterial isolates in biological samples from HIV-infected patients].
AB  - A descriptive and retrospective study was conducted aimed at knowing the behavior and the frequency of the bacterial isolations most frequently found in different biological samples (sputum, blood and urine) from patients with HIV/AIDS diagnosis that were seen at the Outpatient Department or that were admitted at the Hospital of "Pedro Kouri" Institute of Tropical Medicine from 1997 to 2001. It was observed that most of the isolations were obtained from sputum samples and that Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was the most isolated microorganism in all samples. Pseudomonas aeuroginosa proved to be the most isolated microorganism in sputum with 28.5%. The bacteria most commonly isolated in blood was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 48.5%. The uropathogenic microorganism most found in urine was Escherichia coli with 43.5%.
TI  - [Nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  - Nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. We have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. Bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. The three microorganisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In S. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. Streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. Resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. There are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.
TI  - [Vascular by-pass surgery infection incidence and risk factors at the Juan Canalejo Hospital in Corunna within the 2000-2002 period].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular by-pass surgery is being used increasingly more frequently on elderly patients entailing several risk factors. Surgical infections in these procedures are a devastating complication which is related to high morbility and death rates. This study is aimed at ascertaining the incidence of surgical infections among patients having undergone a by-pass procedure with vascular prostheses, the risk factors associated thereto and the type or prosthesis entailing a lower infection rate. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Vascular Surgery Unit of the Juan Canalejo University Hospital throughout the 2000-2002 period. The Disease Control Center infection criteria were those applied. The frequency measurements calculated were cumulative incidence and relative risk as an association measurement. The statistical tests employed were the Chi-square and the Chi-square trend tests, the Student's-T for univariate analysis and logic regression for the multi-variate analysis. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate for the 2000-2002 period was 22.6% to 12.1%. The most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, meticilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. The risk factors related to infection found were female sex (RR=1.8) anesthetic risk >2 (RR=1.7) and patient implanted with sapheneous vein vascular prosthesis (RR=3.8). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors identified were the female sex, anesthetic risk and the type of prosthesis used, all of which condition infection-related complication in by-pass surgery.
TI  - Photodynamic effects of novel XF porphyrin derivatives on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
AB  - The worldwide rise in the rates of antibiotic resistance of bacteria underlines the need for alternative antibacterial agents. A promising approach to the killing of gram-positive antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the skin uses light in combination with a photosensitizer to induce a phototoxic reaction. Different concentrations (0 to 100 microM) of porphyrin-based photosensitizers (CTP1, XF70, and XF73) and different incubation times (5 min, 1 h, and 4 h) were used to determine phototoxicity against two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, one methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strain, one methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, one Escherichia coli strain, and human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Incubation with 0.005 microM XF70 or XF73, followed by illumination, yielded a 3-log10 (> or = 99.9%) decrease in the viable cell numbers of all staphylococcal strains, indicating that the XF drugs have high degrees of potency against gram-positive bacteria and also that the activities of these novel drugs are independent of the antibiotic resistance pattern of the staphylococci examined. CTP1 was less potent against the staphylococci under the same conditions. At 0.005 microM, XF70 and XF73 demonstrated no toxicity toward fibroblasts or keratinocytes. No inactivation of E. coli was detected at this concentration. XF73 was confirmed to act via a reactive oxygen species from the results of studies with sodium azide (a quencher of singlet oxygen), which reduced the killing of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. When a quencher of superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical was used, cell killing was not inhibited. These results demonstrate that the porphyrin-based photosensitizers had concentration-dependent differences in their efficacies of killing of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains via reactive oxygen species without harming eukaryotic cells at the same concentrations.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.

TI  - Role of pencillin binding proteins in pencillin allergy.
AB  - All beta-lactam sensitive bacteria contain enzymatic penicillin binding proteins  (PBPs), which are membrane-bound enzymes and targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. In this work evaluation of the significance of PBPs in immune response to benzylpenicillin was presented. 35 patients with allergic reactions to penicillin and 17 subjects without penicillin allergy, but exposed, were studied. Proliferative T-cell responses to benzylpenicillin, penicillin and PBPs conjugates (Pc-PBPs) from E. coli, K. oxytoca, S. aureus, S. epidermidis or serum protein (Pc-S) were measured. Although each allergic individual responds to Pc-PBPs in several different ways, specific proliferation of T lymphocytes with Pc-PBPs from bacterial membranes was significant higher than with Pc or Pc-S. This observation gives us a real insight into the causes of the drug allergy: individual allergic reaction and susceptibility to the drug is in strict correlation with bacterial infection. It seems likely that acylation of PBPs could be the trigger for primary immune response to the hapten benzylpenicillin.
TI  - CD40 ligand (CD154) takes part in regulation of the transition to mononuclear cell dominance during peritonitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of receptors whose ligand (CD154) is found mainly on membranes of activated mononuclear cells. CD154-CD40 cross-linking is a central event in antigen presentation, B-cell activation, and regulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion from various types of cells. We have previously demonstrated in vitro the presence of CD40 on human peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) and have also shown that CD40 ligation synergizes with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to up-regulate CC chemokine secretion from these cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD40 ligation in leukocyte recruitment during peritonitis. METHODS: Peritonitis was induced in mice by bacterial inoculation, CD40 levels were analyzed on PMC by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. CD154 levels on leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Chemokines mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. CD154 was blocked in vivo using monoclonal antibodies. Results. In mice inoculated by Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli, CD40 in PMC increased twofold at 24 hours and CD154 was induced and reached a peak at 48 hours. In both Gram-positive and Gram-negative-peritonitis, peritoneal macrophages were the main peritoneal leukocyte population to express CD154. Similar results were observed in human subjects during peritonitis. Injection of CD154 blocking monoclonal antibody (MR1) reduced the mononuclear infiltrate by 50% and had no effect on granulocyte recruitment 48 hours after inoculation of S. epidermidis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that CD40 plays a significant role in the process of the mononuclear infiltration during peritonitis.
TI  - Induction of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in J774.2 cells and murine macrophages by lipoteichoic acid and related cell wall antigens from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis causes infections associated with medical devices including central venous catheters, orthopaedic prosthetic joints and artificial heart valves. This coagulase-negative staphylococcus produces a conventional cellular lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and also releases a short-glycerophosphate-chain-length form of LTA (previously termed lipid S) into the medium during growth. The relative pro-inflammatory activities of cellular and short-chain-length exocellular LTA were investigated in comparison with peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acid from S. epidermidis and LPS from Escherichia coli O111. The ability of these components to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] and nitric oxide was investigated in a murine macrophage-like cell line (J774.2), and in peritoneal and splenic macrophages. On a weight-for-weight basis the short-chain-length exocellular LTA was the most active of the S. epidermidis products, stimulating significant amounts of each of the inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, although it was approximately 100-fold less active than LPS from E. coli. By comparison the full-chain-length cellular LTA and peptidoglycan were less active and the wall teichoic acid had no activity. As an exocellular product potentially released from S. epidermidis biofilms, the short-chain-length exocellular LTA may act as the prime mediator of the host inflammatory response to device-related infection by this organism and act as the Gram-positive equivalent of LPS in Gram-negative sepsis. The understanding of the role of short-chain-length exocellular LTA in Gram-positive sepsis may lead to improved treatment strategies.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Dynamic modification of microorganisms by pyrenebutanoate for fluorometric detection in capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Pyrenebutanoate, a fluorescent amphiphilic probe, is suggested here as a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) buffer additive for dynamic modification and analysis of microbial cells. Mixed cultures of microorganisms Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were concentrated, resolved by CZE and detected. Using UV excitation for on-column fluorometric detection, a detection sensitivity for the microorganisms on the order of from one to tens of injected cells was achieved.
TI  - Interlaboratory proficiency testing as a tool for improving performance in laboratories diagnosing bovine mastitis.
AB  - The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency of the Quality Assurance Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom (previously the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) organized a proficiency testing program for laboratories analyzing veterinary mastitis samples. Three test samples with lyophilized strains of common aerobic bacteria were sent to the participating laboratories 7 times between 2000 and 2003. The participants returned 98% of the requested data. The overall performance of the laboratories varied from 63 to 93% in different testing rounds. All laboratories diagnosed Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli correctly at every round. Improvement in diagnosing individual bacteria was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. The overall performance of the laboratories improved with increased participation. The educational role of the program was important. Laboratories working in the veterinary field should implement a documented quality system covering all functions of the laboratory, as well as a planned quality assurance system.
TI  - Enhanced biofilm-production in pathogens isolated from patients with rare metabolic disorders.
AB  - Biofilm-producing bacteria were isolated from the urine of 19 patients with very  rare metabolic disorders including: hyperlactacidaemia (8 cases), sugar intolerance and gammopathy (1 case), cystinuria (2 cases), Parkinson's disease (1 case), lipidaemia (2 cases), hyperaminoaciduria (1 case) and others (4 cases). A total of 34 strains were collected, Gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms were equally distributed among the slime-producing bacteria, with a prevalence of Staphylococcus epidermidis (30%) the most frequent microorganism isolated together with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis that accounted for 15% of this group of strains. A quantitative assay of the biofilm production revealed that in Gram-positive pathogens it was three times greater than that observed in bacteria collected from patients not affected by metabolic diseases (p = 0.0001). In Gram-negative strains the biofilm synthesis was 2.2 times higher than those detected in the same bacteria isolated in the absence of metabolic disorders (p = 0.0033). The results observed indicate that biofilm production is enhanced in bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with metabolic disorders. It is suggested that unusual metabolites might facilitate pathogen production of biofilm found in the urine of these patients.
TI  - [A 7-year survey of strains identified in blood cultures in a clinical hematology unit].
AB  - GOAL: This study had for aim to analyze the epidemiology of strains identified in blood cultures (hopital d'instruction des armees Percy, Clamart, France, hematology unit) to compare the rate of identified micro-organisms with literature data, and to search for a possible correlation between antibiotherapy management and evolution of resistance profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the micro-organisms (N = 690) collected over seven years (January 1996 to December 2002), from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in conventional and sterile sector were studied. RESULTS: Gram positive cocci rate (GPC) was 62.6% and Gram negative bacilli (GNB) 31.3%. Evolution in time showed a decrease of GPC and an increase of GNB, notably the non fermenting Gram negative bacilli, leading to an equal rate by 2001-2002. The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.4%), Escherichia coli (8.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4.9%). The rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococci was 63.6%. Fifty-five percent of E. coli strains had a penicillinase phenotype. Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance was 8.5, 8.5, 6.4 and 8.5%, respectively for ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and amikacin. CONCLUSION: This study showed a tendency to inversion of former bacteremia epidemiology with increasing negative Gram bacilli. It justifies the antibiotherapy protocols adopted in the hematology unit.
TI  - Depolymerization of beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine disrupts the integrity of diverse bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Polymeric beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc) has been implicated as an Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm adhesin, the formation of which requires the pgaABCD and icaABCD loci, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc, demonstrated for the first time by chromatography and mass spectrometry, disrupts biofilm formation by these species and by Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, which possess pgaABCD homologues.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial activity evaluation of some new 1-benzoyl-isothiosemicarbazides.
AB  - The synthesis of some aroylisothiosemicarbazides was accomplished and their biological activity against bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria was investigated. Different synthetic pathways were followed according to the kind of substituents that were introduced on both the aroyl ring and the sulfur atom. Anti-bacterial activity was measured against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi, while antifungal activity was evaluated against C. albicans. Two species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV and Mycobacterium avium ATCC19421, were employed to evaluate antimycobacterial activity.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - An alcohol hand rub containing a synergistic combination of an emollient and preservatives: prolonged activity against transient pathogens.
AB  - A new alcohol-based hand antiseptic (Octoxy hand rub) containing a synergistic combination of an emollient (Octoxyglycerine) and preservatives was developed and evaluated for immediate and prolonged activity against transient bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy was compared with other alcohol hand rubs containing preservative/antimicrobial (Prevacare and Avagard). In vitro evaluation was carried out using a tube-dilution method and a pig-skin model. Rapid and prolonged efficacy in vivo was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis on the hands of volunteers. Octoxy hand rub was 100% effective in rapidly killing pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in vitro. In volunteers, all three hand rubs gave a significant reduction in microbial count within 15s. Octoxy hand rub showed significantly higher efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli than Avagard and Prevacare 15 min after application to the pig-skin model, and against S. epidermidis in both the pig-skin model and in volunteers. Use of Octoxy hand rub with broad-spectrum immediate and prolonged antimicrobial activity may be a very effective way of improving hand hygiene without exposing the hands to higher concentrations of antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). RESULTS: Inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.
TI  - Impact of manufacturing, irradiation and filtration steps to bacterial contamination of autologous fibrin sealant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative production of autologous fibrin sealant has become a routine procedure during the last years. As a certain percentage of blood products is contaminated with bacteria, contamination of plasma used for the production of fibrin sealant cannot be excluded. Especially in the orthopaedic setting, application of contaminated fibrin sealant can cause severe infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We contaminated plasma with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium striatum, Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli and produced fibrin sealant by cryoprecipitation and alcohol precipitation. Additionally, the products were gamma-irradiated at a dose of 30 Gy, frozen at -55 degrees C and filtered through a 0.2 microm filter after thawing. After each preparation step, samples were drawn and numbers of colony forming units were counted after incubation on agar plates. RESULTS: Cryoprecipitation, irradiation, freezing at -55 degrees C, and alcohol precipitation have only little impact on numbers of colony forming units. Filtration through a bacterial filter results in a sterile product. CONCLUSION: Bacteria in plasma as a starting material for production of fibrin sealant survive all routine steps of production, including gamma irradiation and freezing. Filtration of the product through a qualified bacterial filter is the only safe means to provide a sterile product.
TI  - Traditional medicine in Sakarya province (Turkey) and antimicrobial activities of selected species.
AB  - Traditional medicine in North-West of Turkey (Sakarya province) were studied during a 2 months field study by interviewing local informants from several villages. Plant species used to treat infections were tested for antimicrobial activity. Information was collected for 46 plant species from 30 families and for 5 animal species. Twenty four of the plant species were cultivated. Most used families were Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae and the most used plants were Artemisia absinthium, Equisetum telmateia, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica. A total of 139 medicinal uses were obtained. Plants are used mainly for infectious diseases (18%), for neurological and psychological disorders (13.7%), cardiovascular disorders (13%), skin disorders (12.2%) and respiratory disorders (10.1%). Extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using microbroth dilution technique according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This research showed that Arum maculatum, Datura stramonium, Geranium asphodeloides and Equisetum telmateia petroleum ether extracts had MIC values of 39.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml and 39.1 microg/ml, respectively against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Datura stramonium petroleum ether extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli and Trachystemon orientalis ethanol extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity of Arum maculatum, Equisetum telmateia, Geranium asphodeloides, Plantago intermedia, Senecio vulgaris and Trachystemon orientalis has been reported here for the first time.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Synthesis and potent antimicrobial activity of some novel 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides.
AB  - A series of 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides were  synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Certain compounds inhibit bacterial growth with low MIC values (microg/mL). Among them, compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity with MIC values of 3.12 microg/mL against S. aureus, MRSA and MRSE.
TI  - Fishery by-product as a nutrient source for bacteria and archaea growth media.
AB  - A highly soluble fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) with an 80% protein (peptide size between 1.5 and 20 kDa) and a low free amino acid content was obtained from hake (Merluccius hubssi) filleting waste [Lat. Am. Appl. Res. 30 (2000) 241]. Assays with Halobacterium salinarum, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were performed in order to test that FPH as nutrient source for archaea and eubacteria culture media. Cell growth was evaluated by plate count, and by monitoring turbidity and nucleic acids content in liquid cultures. Neither cell growth nor generation times resulting from control and FPH cultures exhibited statistically significant differences at alpha: 0.05 suggesting that FPH can be used as an alternative substrate for microorganism cultural purposes.
TI  - Two novel real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays for rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - The incidence of platelet bacterial contamination is approximately 1 per 2,000 units and has been acknowledged as the most frequent infectious risk from transfusion. In preliminary studies, the sterility of platelet concentrates (PCs) was tested with an automated bacterial blood culturing system and molecular genetic assays. Two real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays performed in a LightCycler instrument were developed and compared regarding specificity and sensitivity by the use of different templates to detect the majority of the clinically important bacterial species in platelets. Primers and probes specific for the conserved regions of the eubacterial 23S rRNA gene or the groEL gene (encoding the 60-kDa heat shock protein Hsp60) were designed. During the development of the 23S rRNA RT-PCR, problems caused by the contamination of reagents with bacterial DNA were noted. Treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen and UV irradiation reduced the level of contaminating DNA. The sensitivity of the assays was greatly influenced by the enzyme system which was used. With rTth DNA polymerase in a one-enzyme system, we detected 500 CFU of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis/ml. With a two-enzyme system consisting of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT and Taq DNA polymerase, we detected 16 CFU/ml. With groEL mRNA as the target of RT-PCR under optimized conditions, we detected 125 CFU of E. coli/ml, and no problems with false-positive results caused by reagent contamination or a cross-reaction with human nucleic acids were found. Furthermore, the use of mRNA as an indicator of viability was demonstrated. Here we report the application of novel real-time RT-PCR assays for the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs that are appropriate for transfusion services.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of biofilm formation processes in the anaerobic, hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima.
AB  - Thermotoga maritima, a fermentative, anaerobic, hyperthermophilic bacterium, was  found to attach to bioreactor glass walls, nylon mesh, and polycarbonate filters during chemostat cultivation on maltose-based media at 80 degrees C. A whole-genome cDNA microarray was used to examine differential expression patterns between biofilm and planktonic populations. Mixed-model statistical analysis revealed differential expression (twofold or more) of 114 open reading frames in sessile cells (6% of the genome), over a third of which were initially annotated as hypothetical proteins in the T. maritima genome. Among the previously annotated genes in the T. maritima genome, which showed expression changes during biofilm growth, were several that corresponded to biofilm formation genes identified in mesophilic bacteria (i.e., Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Most notably, T. maritima biofilm-bound cells exhibited increased transcription of genes involved in iron and sulfur transport, as well as in biosynthesis of cysteine, thiamine, NAD, and isoprenoid side chains of quinones. These findings were all consistent with the up-regulation of iron-sulfur cluster assembly and repair functions in biofilm cells. Significant up-regulation of several beta-specific glycosidases was also noted in biofilm cells, despite the fact that maltose was the primary carbon source fed to the chemostat. The reasons for increased beta-glycosidase levels are unclear but are likely related to the processing of biofilm-based polysaccharides. In addition to revealing insights into the phenotype of sessile T. maritima communities, the methodology developed here can be extended to study other anaerobic biofilm formation processes as well as to examine aspects of microbial ecology in hydrothermal environments.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Improved laboratory diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections in patients with hematological malignancies using PCR and ribosomal RNA sequence analysis.
AB  - During October 1999 to November 2000, 98 blood culture specimens from the same number of febrile episodes originating from 49 patients with hematological malignancies were examined for the presence of eubacteria and fungi based on 16S rRNA gene and the 5.8, 18 and 28S rRNA combined with in vitro PCR amplification and sequencing, in addition to conventional blood culture laboratory techniques. Nineteen of the samples were associated with positive blood cultures. Eubacterial (16S rRNA) PCR detected bacterial DNA in 26 febrile episodes, i.e. in an additional 7 febrile episodes than blood-culture alone. The species identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows Staphylococcus spp (n = 6), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Acinetobacter spp (n = 5), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Enterobacter agglomerans (n = 2), Campylobacter spp (n = 1), Citrobacter spp (n = 1), Corynebacterium spp (n = 1), Enterobacter faecium (n = 1), Ralstonia spp (n = 1), Acidovorax spp. (n = 1) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Gram-positive bacteria were found in 12/27 (44.6%) and gram-negative bacteria were found in 15/27 (55.6%). After optimization of a PCR-based fungal detection method, none of the febrile episodes were shown to be attributable to fungi. The results of this study suggest that fungi are not common causal agents of febrile episodes in patients with a hematological malignancy at this centre and that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of causal agents of bacteremia in patients, so that appropriate antibiotic regimens may be commenced in patients with culture-negative episodes of infection.
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Determination of the critical concentration of neutrophils required to block bacterial growth in tissues.
AB  - We showed previously that the competition between bacterial killing by neutrophils and bacterial growth in stirred serum-containing suspensions could be modeled as the competition between a first-order reaction (bacterial growth) and a second-order reaction (bacterial killing by neutrophils). The model provided a useful parameter, the critical neutrophil concentration (CNC), below which bacterial concentration increased and above which it decreased, independent of the initial bacterial concentration. We report here that this model applies to neutrophil killing of bacteria in three-dimensional fibrin matrices and in rabbit dermis. We measured killing of 10(3)-10(8) colony forming units/ml Staphylococcus epidermidis by 10(5)-10(8) human neutrophils/ml in fibrin gels. The CNC was approximately 4 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of normal serum and approximately 1.6 x 10(7) neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of C5-deficient serum. Application of our model to published data of others on killing of approximately 5 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(8) E. coli/ml rabbit dermis yielded CNCs from approximately 4 x 10(6) to approximately 8 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml dermis. Thus, in disparate tissues and tissuelike environments, our model fits the kinetics of bacterial killing and gives similar lower limits (CNCs) to the neutrophil concentration required to control bacterial growth.
TI  - [Oregano: properties, composition and biological activity].
AB  - The oregano spice includes various plant species. The most common are the genus Origanum, native of Europe, and the Lippia, native of Mexico. Among the species of Origanum. their most important components are the limonene, gamma-cariofilene, rho-cymenene, canfor, linalol, alpha-pinene, carvacrol and thymol. In the genus Lippia, the same compounds can be found. The oregano composition depends on the specie, climate, altitude, time of recollection and the stage of growth. Some of the properties of this plant's extracts are being currently studied due to the growing interest for substituting synthetic additives commonly found in foods. Oregano has a good antioxidant capacity and also presents antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms like Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, among others. These are all characteristics of interest for the food industry because they may enhance the safety and stability of foods. There are also some reports regarding the antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effect of oregano; representing an alternative for the potential treatment and/or prevention of certain chronic ailments, like cancer.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Inhibition of vascular prosthetic graft infection using a photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in surgical techniques and antimicrobial therapies, prosthetic aortic graft infections remain a clinical problem. It is well known that chitosan has strong antibacterial activities to a wide variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The antibacterial activity by adhering a photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel to Dacron grafts was investigated in vitro and in vivo using a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel (50microl) coated grafts (3 x 2mm fragments) were evaluated on a resistance against E. coliin vitro. The graft infections in vivo were also initiated through implantation of a Dacron graft fragment into the infrarenal aorta of a rabbit, followed by a topical inoculation with 10(6) colony-forming units of E. coli. The graft infection was allowed to develop over the following 1 week. RESULTS: The photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel-coated grafts exhibited a resistance against E. coliin vitro. Furthermore, application of 0.1ml photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel on the Dacron implant in vivo substantially inhibited graft infection with E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggested the potential use of a photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel in directing graft infection prophylaxis.
TI  - In vitro bacterial adherence to ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to medical devices has been recognized as an important initial step in the infectious process, but it has not been fully elucidated regarding ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively determine the adherence in vitro of bacteria known to cause VP shunt infections and to identify factors affecting the process. Clinical isolates studied included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Adherence was examined quantitatively per square centimeter, visualized by electron microscopy and related to slime production and hydrophobicity. Although all four strains adhered to VP shunts, there were marked differences, with S. epidermidis and S. aureus showing the highest adherence (67.0 x 10(3) and 15.2 x 10(3) bacteria/cm(2), respectively). Factors affecting adherence included incubation time and temperature, bacterial concentration, device material (lower for silicone than Teflon), slime production and hydrophobicity. These data might be helpful for devising novel strategies to reduce VP shunt infections.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Antibody-directed photodynamic therapy of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a world-wide public health  problem, causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Furthermore, MRSA is increasingly resistant to many conventional antimicrobials, so there is a real need to develop alternative approaches for MRSA decolonization and treatment. Previously, we have demonstrated that MRSA can be killed with an immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SnCe6 conjugate and red light, but effectiveness was dependent on the particular strain and the growth phase. In this investigation, we used an antibody raised against MRSA to make an Ab-SnCe6 conjugate capable of targeting many MRSA strains in all growth phases. To suspensions of important epidemic MRSA, each grown to stationary, lag, or exponential phase, the Ab-SnCe6 conjugate was added and samples exposed to red light. Survivors were then enumerated. This treatment was very effective at killing all the different MRSA strains tested, in all growth phases. The Ab-SnCe6 conjugate was able to kill EMRSA-16 selectively in a mixed suspension of EMRSA-16 and Escherichia coli, and was much better at killing EMRSA-16 than a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, S. epidermidis. These results demonstrate that photodynamic therapy of MRSA is very effective when the photosensitizer is targeted to the pathogen using a suitable antibody and may be a good candidate for a novel treatment of MRSA infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Cryopreservation reduces the concentration of detectable bacteria in contaminated peripheral blood progenitor cell products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial contamination of PBPC products PBPCPs may cause severe clinical complications. There-fore, we investigated the influence of cryopreservation on the sensitivity to detect bacterial contaminations in PBPCPs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Expired PBPCPs (n = 29) were thawed, and defined concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli were inoculated into each bag. After 60 minutes of intermixing, a representative aliquot was drawn and cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar for 24 hours. Then, the products were cryopreserved for 24 hours, and the procedure was repeated as mentioned above. The total numbers of CFUs were counted before and after cryopreservation. RESULTS: A mean concentration of 2529 CFUs per mL of S. epidermidis was determined before cryopreservation versus 2182 CFUs per mL after cryopreservation, demonstrating a decrease of detectable colonies (p < 0.05). For E. coli, the mean numbers were 424 CFUs per mL before cryopreservation and 343 CFUs per mL after cryopreservation, also showing a decrease (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The cryopreservation reduces the concentration of detectable bacteria in contaminated PBPCPs. Especially in sterility testing of PBPCPs with low bacterial contamination, this phenomenon could lead to false-negative results with severe clinical consequences.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Acute neck infections in children.
AB  - A retrospective review was conducted on 132 patients aged between two and 15 years with cervical lymphadenitis and/or with abscess formation to determine the epidemiologic and clinical presentation of these infections. The most common locations were the upper anterior cervical space (43.2%) and the submandibular space (27.3%). The duration of symptoms ranged from 12 hours to 20 days. Results of the pus cultures were available in 31 patients (23.5%). Of these, 16 cultures (51.6%) were positive. The isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.3%), group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (12.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.3%) and Escherichia coli (6.3%). One of the specimens yielded mixed organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Penicillin resistance was documented in six (37.5%) of the 16 gram-positive bacteria isolated from the pus culture. Both throat and blood cultures were available in all 132 patients. Seven throat cultures (5.3%) were positive for group A beta hemolytic streptococci, whereas five blood cultures (3.8%) were reported to have bacterial growth. Sixty-seven patients (50.8%) were treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, 53 patients (40.1%) with ampicillin-sulbactam and ornidazole and 12 patients (9.1%) with ceftriaxone parenterally. The mean duration of hospital stay related to the infection was 7.30 +/- 3.89 days (range, 2-28 days). The mean period for downsizing of the cervical mass by half was 4.05 +/- 2.05 days, and the recovery period (total antibiotic usage period) was 13.72 +/- 5.33 days. All of the patients had an uneventful recovery without complications. Results of both throat and blood cultures were not predictive for etiologic agents in our study group. Since ultrasonographic evaluation of each patient has limited additional benefits in clinical management, it must be reserved for selected cases to document abscess formation.
TI  - Prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. In all, 45 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. A small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. In the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. In the second group, a disc, which was saturated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. In the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. The silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. There was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. In the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of S. epidermidis in two and Proteus mirabilis in the remaining. Three and four cultures were positive in the second and third group, respectively. Low colonies of four different organisms (Escherichia coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. There was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. Based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of selected viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates using riboflavin and light.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A medical device is being developed for the reduction of pathogens in PLT concentrates (PCs). The device uses broadband UV light and the compound riboflavin (vitamin B(2)). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pathogens were added to single-donor PLTs. After treatment, the infectivity of each pathogen was measured using established biologic assays. In vitro PLT performance was evaluated after treatment and after 5 days of storage using a panel of 10 in-vitro cell quality assays. RESULTS: In studies with viral pathogens, the Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) system provided average log reduction factors of 4.46 +/- 0.39 for intracellular HIV, 5.93 +/- 0.20 for cells associated HIV, and 5.19 +/- 0.50 for West Nile virus. For the nonenveloped porcine parvovirus, a reduction factor greater than 5.0 log was observed. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli bacteria were also tested with observed reduction factors to the limits of detection of 4.0 log or greater. PLT cell quality was adequately maintained after treatment and during storage. Although P-selectin expression, glucose consumption, and lactate production increased relative to controls, this was not beyond accepted levels. The pH of treated PCs also decreased slightly relative to control PLTs on Days 1 and 5. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the device successfully reduced the number of selected pathogens in PCs. Despite the fact that significant differences exist between treated and control in-vitro variables, it is speculated that the clinical effectiveness of both products will not be significantly different, based on comparison to historical data for products in routine clinical use today.
TI  - Promotion of peptide antimicrobial activity by fatty acid conjugation.
AB  - Three peptides, YGAA[KKAAKAA](2) (AKK), KLFKRHLKWKII (SC4), and YG[AKAKAAKA](2) (KAK), were conjugated with lauric acid and tested for the effect on their structure, antibacterial activity, and eukaryotic cell toxicity. The conjugated AKK and SC4 peptides showed increased antimicrobial activity relative to unconjugated peptides, but the conjugated KAK peptide did not. The circular dichroism spectrum of AKK showed a significantly larger increase in its alpha-helical content in the conjugated form than peptide KAK in a solution containing phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphotidylglycerol vesicles, which mimics bacterial membranes. The KAK and AKK peptides and their corresponding fatty acid conjugates showed little change in their structure in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles, which mimic the cell membrane of eukaryotic cells. The hemolytic activity of the KAK and AKK peptides and conjugates was low. However, the SC4 fatty acid conjugate showed a large increase in hemolytic activity and a corresponding increase in helical content in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. These results support the model of antimicrobial peptide hemolytic and antimicrobial activity being linked to changes in secondary structure as the peptides interact with lipid membranes. Fatty acid conjugation may improve the usefulness of peptides as antimicrobial agents by enhancing their ability to form secondary structures upon interacting with the bacterial membranes.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Kidney transplants from infected donors: our experience.
AB  - Organ procurement from infected donors may transmit a disease to the recipient that could cause a graft loss and/or recipient morbidity. Retrospectively, all kidney transplants from infected donors at our center in the last 4 years were reviewed. A donor was considered infected in the presence of at least one positive culture before procurement. From January 1999 to 2003, 23 of 160 donors (14.5%) were infected: in 10 donors a positive blood culture; in 3, a urine culture; and in 13, a bronchial culture. In a further 12 (7%) donors, only the preservation solution was contaminated. Organisms isolated were: Staphylococcus coagulase.neg. (n = 7); Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3); Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4); Acinetobacter (n = 1); Candida albicans (n = 13); Aspergillus (n = 1); and Escherichia coli (n = 1). All except 2 kidneys were transplanted with positivity in all cultures. All recipients received general, nonspecific, antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis until the antibiotic and antifungal spectrum was ready. Patient and graft survival rates at 6 months were 94% and 93%, respectively. Two deaths occurred due to bacterial arteritis (P aeruginosa), and 2 acute graft losses due to fungal arteritis. Kidneys from infected donors seem suitable for transplants. Only grafts infected by vasculotropic agents (S aureus, P aeruginosa, and C albicans) should be discarded.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  - Standard microbiological tests (i.e., MIC) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. Our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (PFT) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. The methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. Thirty-six clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. In the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis. Titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. Titers were highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. Overall, PFTs were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.0001). The addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.0001). In the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (P = 0.036). In conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the PFT as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. With further characterization and validation in patients, the PFT test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for PD-related peritonitis.
TI  - Cyclic peptide alkaloids from the bark of Discaria americana.
AB  - The isolation and structure determination of cyclic peptide alkaloids, discarine-M and discarine-N, along with seven known cyclic peptide alkaloids, adouetine-Y', franganine, frangulanine, discarines-A, -B, -C, and -D from the root bark of Discaria americana are described. Structures were determined spectroscopically, especially using 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. The crude methanol extract, the basic ether extract, and the alkaloids 6 and 7 also weakly inhibited growth of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - Microbial screening of UC blood units by an automated culture system: effect of delayed testing on bacterial detection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial screening is a mandatory test for banked UC blood (UCB) to  comply with the code of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Cord blood banks (CBBs) are not always closely located to a GMP-licensed microbiology laboratory, resulting in time delays for transport of specimens prior to microbiological testing. This study investigated the influence of >/=24 h delays in initiating automated microbial screening on the detection of bacteria in UCB, by analysis of specimens deliberately spiked with bacteria and the recovery of bacteria from cryopreserved spiked-UCB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UCB was processed according to standard CBB procedures and spiked with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli [2-2000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL]. Spiked-UCB (0.5 mL) was (1) held at room temperature (RT) and inoculated into pediatric BacT/Alert bottles (bioMerieux) at Days 1, 4 and 7 (delayed inoculation); and (2) inoculated directly (Day 0) into replicate BacT/Alert bottles and held at RT for 1, 4 or 7 days before loading onto the BacT/ALERT system (delayed loading). Spiked-UCB samples were cryopreserved. Bacterial counts were quantitated on horse blood agar plates. RESULTS: Bacterial growth in UCB spiked with a single bacterium was capable of detection by the BacT/ALERT system. S. epidermidis grew in all conditions of delayed testing (ie. delayed inoculation and delayed loading). E. coli failed to grow under conditions of delayed inoculation but grew at all time points of delayed loading. S. epidermidis and E. coli were recovered from cryopreserved spiked-UCB. DISCUSSION: Inoculation of culture bottles as soon as possible after sample preparation is preferable. Bacteria can maintain viability in BacT/ALERT bottles inoculated and held at RT for up to 7 days prior to automated culture testing. Bacteria can be successfully recovered from cryopreserved UCB.
TI  - Mechanism of action of the mannopeptimycins, a novel class of glycopeptide antibiotics active against vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The naturally occurring mannopeptimycins (formerly AC98-1 through AC98-5) are a novel class of glycopeptide antibiotics that are active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria. The structures of the mannopeptimycins suggested that they might act by targeting cell wall biosynthesis, similar to other known glycopeptide antibiotics; but the fact that the mannopeptimycins retain activity against vancomycin-resistant organisms suggested that they might have a unique mode of action. By using a radioactive mannopeptimycin derivative bearing a photoactivation ligand, it was shown that mannopeptimycins interact with the membrane-bound cell wall precursor lipid II [C(55)-MurNAc-(peptide)-GlcNAc] and that this interaction is different from the binding of other lipid II-binding antibiotics such as vancomycin and mersacidin. The antimicrobial activities of several mannopeptimycin derivatives correlated with their affinities toward lipid II, suggesting that the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis was primarily through lipid II binding. In addition, it was shown that mannopeptimycins bind to lipoteichoic acid in a rather nonspecific interaction, which might facilitate the accumulation of antibiotic on the bacterial cell surface.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Face and body sponges: beauty aids or potential microbiological reservoir?
AB  - Small natural or synthetic sponges are commonly used in daily hygiene and in removing make-up. In our study we try to assess the role of sponges as reservoirs and vehicles in the transmission of potentially pathogenic bacterial species. We demonstrate that numerous Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species are detectable in sponges after normal use by the healthy population. The most common bacteria to be found are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in both cellulose and nylon sponges; this observation supports the idea that the environmental factors (humidity, temperature) favour bacterial growth more than the different materials the sponges are made of. Sponges should be restricted to personal use, regularly washed, completely dried and kept in a dry place.
TI  - Role of commensal bacteria in development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and  preimmune antibody repertoire.
AB  - Intestinal bacteria are required for development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), which mediate a variety of host immune functions, such as mucosal immunity and oral tolerance. In rabbits, the intestinal microflora are also required for developing the preimmune Ab repertoire by promoting somatic diversification of Ig genes in B cells that have migrated to GALT. We studied the mechanism of bacteria-induced GALT development. Bacteria were introduced into rabbits in which the appendix had been rendered germfree by microsurgery (we refer to these rabbits as germfree-appendix rabbits). We then identified specific members of the intestinal flora that promote GALT development. The combination of Bacteroides fragilis and Bacillus subtilis consistently promoted GALT development and led to development of the preimmune Ab repertoire, as shown by an increase in somatic diversification of VDJ-C micro genes in appendix B cells. Neither species alone consistently induced GALT development, nor did Clostridium subterminale, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. B. fragilis, which by itself is immunogenic, did not promote GALT development; hence, GALT development in rabbits does not appear to be the result of an Ag-specific immune response. To identify bacterial pathways required for GALT development, we introduced B. fragilis along with stress-response mutants of B. subtilis into germfree-appendix rabbits. We identified two Spo0A-controlled stress responses, sporulation and secretion of the protein YqxM, which are required for GALT development. We conclude that specific members of the commensal, intestinal flora drive GALT development through a specific subset of stress responses.
TI  - [Impact of secondary pancreatic infection on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis: an analysis of 60 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of secondary pancreatic infection (SPI) on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Clinical data of 60 patients with SAP (January 1, 1980-December 31, 1999), especially the data at the onset of SPI, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty patients were divided into two groups: SPI group (29 cases) and non-SPI group (31 cases). There was no significant difference in gender, average age, scores of Ranson and of high risk factors of China Medical Association between two groups, but the average stay days in hospital, payment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, days of fever, prehospital days, days of high white blood cell (WBC) count, the duration of constipation after the onset of SAP and average times of operation were significantly higher in SPI group than that of non-SPI group. Fatality rate of SPI group (7/29, 24.14 percent) was higher than that of non-SPI (1/31, 3.23 percent). There were 14 cases of infection with single microorganism (48.3 percent) and 15 cases of mixed infection (51.7 percent) in SPI group. Twenty-seven patients were infected with bacteria of Enterobacteriaecae (Escherichia 25, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Proteus morgani 1, 8 with bacteria of Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa 7, P. stanieri 1), 2 with fungus, 5 with other bacteria (Bacillus subtilis 2, Tetracoccus 1, Acetobacteraceae 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) in SPI group. Only in 2 patients with infective pancreatic necrosis the blood culture was positive (Escherichia coli). CONCLUSION: These results showed that the major source of SPI is entergenous, and SPI would affect the prognosis of SAP patients. With the present therapeutic regimes it was hard to prevent entergenous infections. It is necessary to find a new strategy.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - [Examination of urogenital tract microorganism infection and antibiotic susceptibility test].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate bacteria, mycoplasma and chlamydia from the urogenital tract, and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: Bacteria, mycoplasma and chlamydia were isolated from the urogenital tract secretion by artifical culture, and their antibiotic susceptibility was detected by disk diffusion. RESULTS: The common microorganisms were S. epidermidis and corynebacberium, and the minority microorganisms were G- bacteria or E. coli. Bacteria were susceptible to amikacin, cephazolin V, rifampin, gentamycin, and docycyclin. CONCLUSION: S. epidermidis and corynebacterium are important pathogens of the urogenital tract infection. Disk susceptibility test can be used to screen the susceptible antibiotic.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Structure-based design of an indolicidin peptide analogue with increased protease stability.
AB  - Indolicidin is an antimicrobial cationic peptide with broad-spectrum activity isolated from bovine neutrophils. An indolicidin analogue CP-11, ILKKWPWWPWRRK-NH(2), with improved activity against Gram-negative bacteria had increased positive charge and amphipathicity while maintaining the short length of the parent molecule. The structure of CP-11 in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CP-11 was found to be an amphipathic molecule with a U-shaped backbone bringing the N- and C-termini in close proximity. On the basis of this close proximity, a cyclic disulfide-bonded peptide cycloCP-11, ICLKKWPWWPWRRCK-NH(2), was designed to stabilize the lipid-bound structure and to increase protease resistance. The three-dimensional structure of cycloCP-11 was determined under the same conditions as for the linear peptide and was found to be similar to CP-11. Both CP-11 and cycloCP-11 associated with phospholipid membranes in a similar manner as indicated by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CP-11 and cycloCP-11 for a range of bacteria differed by no more than 2-fold, and they were nonhemolytic at concentrations up to 256 microg/mL. Cyclization was found to greatly increase protease stability. The half-life of cycloCP-11 in the presence of trypsin was increased by 4.5-fold from 4 to 18 min. More importantly, the antibacterial activity of cycloCP-11, but not that of CP-11, in the presence of trypsin was completely retained up to 90 min since the major degradation product was equally active. A structural comparison of CP-11 and cycloCP-11 revealed that the higher trypsin resistance of cycloCP-11 may be due to the more compact packing of lysine and tryptophan side chains. These findings suggest that cyclization may serve as an important strategy in the rational design of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of PEO-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. In this paper, a PEO-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. Subsequently, the presence of a PEO-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. For five bacterial (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis), adhesion to PEO-brushes was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rates of Sta. epidermidis, Sta. aureus and Str. salivarius to glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while E. coli and P. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. The initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for C. albicans GB 1/2 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9, respectively. Coating of the glass surface with a PEO-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic P. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. For both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic C. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic C. albicans. The PEO-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. Assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the Lifshitz-Van der Waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. Decreased Lifshitz-van der Waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.
TI  - Influence of air-ions on selected microorganisms.
AB  - In the following work the influence of air-ions and ozone on the selected microorganisms, first of all on Staphylococcus epidermidis is discussed. Carried out investigations proved that the levels of air-ions concentrations, causing specific changes in the development of particular microorganisms, are very differentiated and depend on individual parameters of those organisms. These levels are generally characterized by high values of concentrations, range n +/- =4 x 10(6) ions/cm3 and are connected with the type of the air-ions used. However investigations did not confirm any negative influence of the positive air-ions seen as a destructive factor upon any of the investigated microorganisms.
TI  - IsdG and IsdI, heme-degrading enzymes in the cytoplasm of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus requires iron for growth and utilizes heme as a source of iron during infection. Staphylococcal surface proteins capture hemoglobin, release heme from hemoglobin and transport this compound across the cell wall envelope and plasma membrane into the bacterial cytoplasm. Here we show that Staphylococcus aureus isdG and isdI encode cytoplasmic proteins with heme binding properties. IsdG and IsdI cleave the tetrapyrrol ring structure of heme in the presence of NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, thereby releasing iron. Further, IsdI complements the heme utilization deficiency of a Corynebacterium ulcerans heme oxygenase mutant, demonstrating in vivo activity of this enzyme. Although Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus anthracis encode homologues of IsdG and IsdI, these proteins are not found in other bacteria or mammals. Thus, it appears that bacterial pathogens evolved different strategies to retrieve iron from scavenged heme molecules and that staphylococcal IsdG and IsdI represent examples of bacterial heme-oxygenases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel autolysin (Aae) with adhesive properties from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation on polymer surfaces is considered a  major pathogenicity factor in foreign-body-associated infections. Previously, the 148 kDa autolysin AtlE from S. epidermidis, which is involved in the initial attachment of the cells to polymer surfaces and also binds to the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin, was characterized. Here, the characterization of a novel autolysin/adhesin (Aae) in S. epidermidis is described. Aae was identified as a 35 kDa surface-associated protein that has bacteriolytic activity and binds vitronectin. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined and the respective gene, aae, was cloned. DNA-sequence analysis revealed that aae encodes a deduced protein of 324 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35 kDa. Aae contains three repetitive sequences in its N-terminal portion. These repeats comprise features of a putative peptidoglycan binding domain (LysM domain) found in a number of enzymes involved in cell-wall metabolism and also in some adhesins. Expression of aae by Escherichia coli and subsequent analysis revealed that Aae possesses bacteriolytic activity and adhesive properties. The interaction of Aae with fibrinogen, fibronectin and vitronectin was found to be dose-dependent and saturable and to occur with high affinity, by using the real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA). Aae binds to the Aalpha- and Bbeta-chains of fibrinogen and to the 29 kDa N-terminal fragment of fibronectin. In conclusion, Aae is a surface-associated protein with bacteriolytic and adhesive properties representing a new member of the staphylococcal autolysin/adhesins potentially involved in colonization.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Essential oil analysis and antimicrobial activity of eight Stachys species from Greece.
AB  - The volatile composition of eight Stachys species has been studied. The investigated taxa were St. alopecuros (L.) Bentham., St. scardica (Griseb.) Hayek, St. cretica L. ssp. cretica, St. germanica L. ssp. heldreichii (Boiss.) Hayek, St. recta L., St. spinulosa L., St. euboica Rech. and St. menthifolia Vis., growing wild in Greece. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and their analyses were performed by GC and GC-MS. Identification of the substances was made by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices with literature records. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were shown to be the main group of constituents of all taxa. Furthermore, the obtained essential oils were tested against the following six bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 10907), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 2228), as well as against the following five fungi: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Penicillium ochrochloron (ATCC 9112), Epidermophyton floccosum (clinical isolates), Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (clinical isolates). The tested essential oils showed better activity against bacterial species than against fungi. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant strain, as none of the essential oils was active against this strain. The essential oil of St. scardica has been proven most active against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - Promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. F'lac plasmid elimination of E. coli K12 LE140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant Gram-positive species (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees C. Growth kinetics of different bacterial species were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. We observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial community. Some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with S. epidermidis. In our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Hypericum species.
AB  - The crude methanolic extracts of six species of Hypericum [H. caprifoliatum Cham. & Schlecht., H. carinatum Griseb., H. connatum Lam., H. ternum A. St. Hil., H. myrianthum Cham. & Schlecht. and H. polyanthemum Klotzsch ex Reichardt] growing in southern Brazil were analyzed for antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). The most active plant was H. caprifoliatum, which showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Only H. polyanthemum and H. ternum extracts were active against Bacillus subtilis. None of the crude methanolic extracts showed activity against S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Extracts from these species were evaluated chemically and tannin, flavonoid and phenolic acids were the prominent compounds. The plants contained quercitrin, hyperoside (except H. connatum) and, less frequently, isoquercitrin and chlorogenic acid. In contrast to H. perforatum, which has high concentrations of rutin, these species do not produce this flavonoid or it appears as traces. The tannin concentration varied between 5.1 and 16.7% in H. myrianthum and H. ternum, respectively.
TI  - Risk factors for the development of bacterial infections in multiple myeloma treated with two different vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone schedules.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We evaluated bacterial infections (BIs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with two different schedules of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD). DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients were studied during 340 VAD cycles. VAD was given by either continuous intravenous infusion (CII) to hospitalized patients or rapid intravenous infusion (RII) to outpatients. The characteristics of patients and VAD schedules were retrospectively analyzed to detect correlations with the incidence of BI. RESULTS: By analyzing each VAD cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.06) and post-treatment neutropenia (p=0.08) were associated with a trend for a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with BI risk at both univariate (p<0.02) and multivariate (p<0.002) analyses. Evaluating only the first 4 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of BI than the later period (p<0.0001), previously untreated disease was significantly correlated with BI risk (p<0.04), while male sex (p=0.06), CII schedule (p=0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.1) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection; however, at multivariate analysis the latter two parameters independently predicted BI probability (p<0.015 and p<0.03, respectively) as did previously untreated disease (p<0.025). The high probability of CII-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive VAD as first line treatment are at a major risk of BI up to the completion of the fourth month of therapy. In this setting hospitalization should be avoided and, if patients require admission, antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins could be appropriate and effective.
TI  - Water birth: microbiological colonisation of the newborn, neonatal and maternal infection rate in comparison to conventional bed deliveries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The risk of infectious complications after water birth which might  be due to water contaminated by faecal bacteria or environmental microbes from the water supply system is still in discussion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a microbiological study comparing neonatal bacterial colonisation after water birth to conventional bed deliveries with or without relaxation bath. In all three groups (96 deliveries) we isolated most frequently from ear and palate of the newborns Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and enterococci, which belong to the normal vaginal flora. RESULTS: Neonatal outcome, infants and maternal infection rate did not differ between the three groups.
TI  - Comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  - An agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. The catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. The efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (CS) catheters, CS catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (CS+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (MR) catheters and silver catheters against Staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RIF-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. No significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. In both models, CS+ and MR catheters were effective against S. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas CS catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. CS+ catheters were effective against S. epidermidis RIF-r2, whereas MR catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. CS+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in the agar model, whereas MR catheters were effective only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. The agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.
TI  - Curvularia haloperoxidase: antimicrobial activity and potential application as a  surface disinfectant.
AB  - A presumed antimicrobial enzyme system, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, was examined with the aim of evaluating its potential as a sanitizing agent. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Curvularia haloperoxidase facilitates the oxidation of halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, to antimicrobial compounds. The Curvularia haloperoxidase system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Candida sp. and Rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubigensis, Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. Also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed. The numbers of S. marcescens and S. epidermidis cells adhering to contact lenses were reduced from 4.0 and 4.9 log CFU to 1.2 and 2.7 log CFU, respectively, after treatment with the Curvularia haloperoxidase system. The killing effect of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system was rapid, and 10(6) CFU of E. coli cells/ml were eliminated within 10 min of treatment. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect was short lived, causing no antibacterial effect against E. coli 10 min after the system was mixed. Bovine serum albumin (1%) and alginate (1%) inhibited the antimicrobial activity of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, whereas glucose and Tween 20 did not affect its activity. In conclusion, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system is an effective sanitizing system and has the potential for a vast range of applications, for instance, for disinfection of contact lenses or medical devices.
TI  - The use of intradiscal antibiotics for discography: an in vitro study of gentamicin, cefazolin, and clindamycin.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: In vitro determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)  of gentamicin, cefazolin, and clindamycin, alone and in combination with iohexol against laboratory strains of Eschericia coli B, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of iohexol on the efficacy of gentamicin, cefazolin, and clindamycin. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prophylactic antibiotics have been advocated to prevent discitis following discography. Intravenous cefazolin administered before discography has been shown to penetrate the intervertebral disc. However, the use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis may lead to bacterial resistance. Intradiscal antibiotic administration is an attractive alternative to systemic antibiotic prophylaxis before discography, but there is no data documenting the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics in the presence of iohexol. METHODS: MICs were determined by adding standard concentrations of bacteria to serial dilutions of antibiotic with and without the addition of iohexol in Todd-Hewitt Broth medium. MICs were determined as the lowest concentration well that demonstrated inhibition of cell growth. RESULTS: Gentamicin, cefazolin, and clindamycin remain efficacious in the presence of iohexol. MICs were lower for cefazolin and gentamycin than for clindamycin. Iohexol alone also demonstrated some inhibition of cell growth. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of intradiscal antibiotics for prophylaxis of disc space infection during discography. lntradiscal placement of antibiotic should obviate the need for systemic antibiotic prophylaxis and its attendant risk of generating antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary Foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CXS) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (CXST) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (SH) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (NF) catheters. DESIGN: The antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone of inhibition assay. A novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. The "meatus" was inoculated daily with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerginosa, and Candida albicans. The "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. RESULTS: Both CXS and CXST catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than SH and NF catheters. In the in vitro model, CXST latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with CXS (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (P = .01). CXST latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with SH catheters (P = .01). CXST silicone catheters resisted colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did NF catheters (9 to 11 days) (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.
TI  - Has cerumen a protective role in recurrent external otitis?
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the bactericidal activity of the cerumen in patients with recurrent otitis externa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerumen samples were collected from 2 groups. Group A (n = 20) consisted of patients with recurrent otitis externa (2 or more acute otitis externa attack in the current year) and group B (n = 30) consisted of cerumen from a healthy population. We examined the bactericidal activity against the common microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus) that encounter the recurrent otitis externa. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the count of S epidermidis was observed in group A (P <.05) and B (P <.01) was observed. A comparison of decreases and increases in the percentages of microorganisms between the groups A and B showed that there was a significant difference only in the count of E coli (P <or=.05). The count of E coli decreased in cerumen suspension in group A, but it increased in the normal population. CONCLUSION: We did not confirm that cerumen from patients with recurrent otitis externa had less bactericidal activity than from a healthy population.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Chlamydia pneumoniae binds to platelets and triggers P-selectin expression and aggregation: a causal role in cardiovascular disease?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence linking Chlamydia pneumoniae to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expanding. Platelets are considered to play an essential role in cardiovascular diseases; however, so far platelets have not been associated with an infectious cause of atherosclerosis. This study aims to clarify the interaction between C pneumoniae and platelets and possibly present a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of C pneumoniae on platelet aggregation and secretion were assessed with lumiaggregometry, and the ability of C pneumoniae to bind to platelets and stimulate expression of P-selectin was analyzed with flow cytometry. We found that C pneumoniae, at a chlamydia:platelet ratio of 1:15, adheres to platelets and triggers P-selectin expression after 1 minute and causes an extensive aggregation and ATP secretion after 20 minutes of incubation. Inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser or abciximab markedly reduced C pneumoniae-induced platelet aggregation. Exposure of C pneumoniae to polymyxin B, but not elevated temperature, abolished the stimulatory effects on platelet activation, suggesting that chlamydial lipopolysaccharide has an active role. In contrast, other tested bacteria had no or only moderate effects on platelet functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a new concept of how C pneumoniae activates platelets and thereby may cause atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular occlusion.
TI  - Characterization of RAP, a quorum sensing activator of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus are Gram-positive bacteria and cause diverse serious diseases in humans and animals through the production of toxins. The production of toxins is regulated by quorum sensing mechanisms, where proteins such as RNAIII activating protein (RAP) are secreted by the bacteria and induce virulence. Antibodies to RAP have been shown to protect mice from infection, but the molecular structure of RAP was not known and hindered vaccine development. To characterize RAP, recombinant protein was made and tested for its ability to induce genes important for pathogenesis (agr). In addition, monoclonal antibodies were produced to identify its cellular localization. Results shown here indicate that RAP is a 277-aa protein that is an ortholog of the ribosomal protein L2. Like the native molecule, recombinant RAP activates the production of RNAIII (encoded by agr). Using RAP specific monoclonal antibodies we demonstrate that RAP is continuously secreted and while RAP is expressed also in other bacteria (like Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus xylosus and Escherichia coli), it is secreted to the culture medium only by S. aureus. Our results show that the ribosomal protein L2 has an extraribosomal function and that when secreted RAP acts as an autoinducer of virulence to regulate S. aureus pathogenesis.
TI  - Bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from Centaurium erythraea.
AB  - As part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from Scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Family: Gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative HPLC coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by UV, FABMS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. Antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. Both compounds inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. While swertiamarin was also active against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the LD50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. Chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family Gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Ultrasound increases the rate of bacterial cell growth.
AB  - Ultrasound was employed to increase the growth rate of bacterial cells attached to surfaces. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli cells adhered to and grew on a polyethylene surface in the presence of ultrasound. It was found that low-frequency ultrasound (70 kHz) of low acoustic intensity (<2 W/cm(2)) increased the growth rate of the cells compared to growth without ultrasound. However, at high intensity levels, cells were partially removed from the surface. Ultrasound also enhanced planktonic growth of S. epidermidis and other planktonic bacteria. It is hypothesized that ultrasound increases the rate of transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and increases the rate of transport of waste products away from the cells, thus enhancing their growth.
TI  - [Long-term Cefadroxil prophylaxis in children with recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose, long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in children. A prospective, randomized trial in 33 children (32 female, 1 male) aged 2-14 years (mean 8.1+/-2.8) was conducted. Children with recurrent urinary tract infections were commenced to six-month prophylaxis with cefadroxil at the dosage of 12.5-15.0 mg/kg at bedtime administered every night (group I, n=15) or alternate night (group II, n=18). Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (90.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.0%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.0%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.0%). Cefadroxil prophylaxis was effective in 80% of patients in group I and in 78% patients in group II. Reinfection occurred in 3/15 (20%) patients in-group I and in 4/18 (22.2%) patients in-group II (odds ratio--1.14; 95% confidence interval--0.16-8.3). The difference of reinfection rate between the groups was not significant (p=0.88). The rate of day- and night-time wetting in both groups before prophylaxis of urinary tract infections was high. It decreased significantly at the end of prophylactic treatment with cefadroxil (from 42.4% to 9.1% and from 39.4% to 6.1% respectively). Mild adverse reaction (nausea) was observed in 1/33 patient. In conclusion our study shows that cefadroxil is an effective, well-tolerated and safe agent in the urinary tract infections prophylaxis. Prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections in children with cefadroxil on alternate night regimen might reduce the cost of the treatment.
TI  - Wound infections in two health institutions in Ile-Ife, Nigeria: results of a cohort study.
AB  - The control of wound infections is increasingly complicated, yet treatment is not always guided by microbiological diagnosis. To describe the distribution of wound infections and causative agents, a prospective, 6-month cohort study involving 102 outpatients was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital and the Health Center in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Location and type of infected wounds were recorded and bacterial isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques. Almost half (40%) of all infected wounds were attributed to trauma and, in most cases, located on the extremities. Of the 162 bacterial isolates obtained from wound cultures, 39 were monomicrobial and 55 were polymicrobial; no bacterial isolate was obtained in eight cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant micro-organism (25%), followed by Escherichia coli (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%). The diversity of micro-organisms and the high incidence of polymicrobic flora in this study give credence to the value of identifying one or more bacterial pathogens from wound cultures. The recognition of causative agents of wound infections can assist wound care practitioners in taking appropriate measures. Continuous dialogue between the microbiology department and wound care practitioners is strongly advised in order to improve treatment outcomes and slow the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Sol-gel column technology for capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms and biopolymers with UV or fluorometric detection.
AB  - The sol-gel surface modification is used for capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms and biopolymers. The coating strongly decreases the electroosmotic flow so that it enables the use of the short capillaries down to 100 mm in the separation length. The examples of capillary isoelectric focusing of the low-molecular-mass pI markers and mixed cultures of microbial populations of Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enteroccocus faecalis with UV detection are shown. It is possible to quantify bacterial cells according to their peak areas; the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5 x 10(2)-1 x 10(3). The compatibility of sol-gel capillaries with sensitive fluorometric detection of fluorescent pI markers together with fluorescein labeled proteins is demonstrated.
TI  - Comparison of the bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against  Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - In addition to MIC and MBC tests in this study the serum bactericidal activity of 3.1 microg/ml of moxifloxacin or 5.2 microg/ml of levofloxacin was determined against ten susceptible strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Moxifloxacin achieved markedly better activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis as compared to levofloxacin. Activity of moxifloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae was excellent but not superior to levofloxacin. In conclusion both fluorquinolones are highly effective against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, moxifloxacin being superior with respect to gram-positives like S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - [Biological importance of the anti-carnosine activity of bacteria].
AB  - The anticarnosine activity has been found to be widely spread among bacteria, the degree of its manifestation depending on the source of isolation. The fact that anticarnosine activity plays a certain role in the phenomenon of persistence has been proved on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in rats.
TI  - CAPD peritonitis induces the production of a novel peptide, daintain/allograft inflammatory factor-1.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the occurrence of a novel macrophage-derived peptide, daintain/allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1), in dialysate from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients at commencement and after a follow-up period of therapy and during peritonitis. In addition, we studied peptide production in response to bacterial stimulation of monocytes and macrophages. DESIGN: Peritoneal fluid and supernatants from cells stimulated with different bacteria were analyzed for daintain/AIF-1. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Peritoneal fluid was obtained from 5 patients at commencement of CAPD therapy and during 8 weeks' follow-up, and from 14 patients (10 males, 4 females) during CAPD peritonitis and during the noninfected steady state. All patients were admitted to the Karolinska Hospital. A human monocyte cell-line, THP-1 was differentiated to macrophages, and both monocytes and macrophages were stimulated with live and heat-inactivated Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis. Cells were also stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon gamma (IFNgamma). Daintain/AIF-1 was analyzed with radioimmunoassay technique and IL-8 with enzyme immunoassay technique. RESULTS: An increased production of daintain/AIF-1 was observed in the first spent dialysate in the newly started CAPD patients, with a decrease during the follow-up period (p < 0.05). During peritonitis, the first spent dialysate revealed significantly higher levels of daintain/AIF-1 (3.9 ng/mL) compared to the noninfected state (0.8 ng/mL), with production normalizing after 9-12 days. Bacterial stimulation with E. coli, S. aureus, or S. epidermidis induced higher daintain/AIF-1 response in monocytes compared to macrophages (p < 0.05). Live bacteria induced higher production of the peptide compared to heat-inactivated bacteria (p < 0.05). Interleukin-1beta and IFNgamma were used to stimulate monocytes and macrophages; however, no daintain/AIF-1 production was found, although increased IL-8 levels were detected. CONCLUSION: CAPD peritonitis induces a high and prominent daintain/AIF-1 response. Bacteria are able to induce a response of the peptide from monocytes and macrophages, and it is likely that the virulent parts of the bacteria are heat-labile structures. The early rise in daintain/ AIF-1 might be used as a marker of CAPD peritonitis.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - Antibacterial bromophenols from the marine red alga Rhodomela confervoides.
AB  - Two bromophenols, together with three known compounds, were isolated from the methanolic extract of the marine alga, Rhodomela confervoides. By means of MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses, they were identified as 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5-(hydroxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (1) and 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5- (ethoxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (2). Three known compounds were also isolated, namely 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5-(methoxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (3), 4,4'- methylenebis [5,6-dibromo-1,2-benzenediol] (4) and bis (2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether (5). Compound 5 was the most active against five strains of bacteria with the MIC less than 70 microg/ml, while compounds 2, 3 and 4 exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Affinity of Helicobacter pylori to cholesterol and other steroids.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori has a particular affinity to cholesterol. It is not known, however, whether other steroidal substances are bound as well. In order to characterize the specificity and nature of the H. pylori-steroid interaction, the affinity of H. pylori to cholesterol and several steroidal hormones was investigated. Seven strains of H. pylori (five reference strains, two wild strains) and one strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli were cultured on a cholesterol-free medium. Cholesterol-free bacteria were incubated with cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol and several cyclodextrin-mediated steroidal hormones (beta-estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone). The steroid contents of the bacteria were determined by gas liquid chromatography. High amounts of cholesterol were detected in all H. pylori strains, whilst steroidal hormones were not found. Neither S. epidermidis nor E. coli showed an appreciable amount of cholesterol in the chromatographic examinations. Bacterial pretreatment with proteinase K diminished cholesterol adsorption of H. pylori. These data indicate a specific affinity of H. pylori to cholesterol. This unique property might serve as a pathogenicity component enabling survival and colonization of H. pylori in the gastric environment.
TI  - Surgical infants on total parenteral nutrition have impaired cytokine responses to microbial challenge.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cytokines are essential for the prevention of microbial infections. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in infancy is associated with an increased risk of infection, and this could be related to altered cytokine production. The aim of the study was to determine if cytokine production is altered in monocytes from surgical infants receiving TPN. METHODS: There were 3 study groups: (a) infants receiving TPN, (b) enterally fed healthy control infants, and (c) enterally fed healthy control adults. Blood samples were incubated with either Escherichia coli LPS, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or with medium alone. Flow cytometry was used to measure monocyte intracellular cytokine: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta. RESULTS: After LPS stimulation, the percent of monocytes producing TNF-alpha and IL-6 were lower in infants on TPN than both control infants and adults. This was most apparent for TNF-alpha. The difference for IL-1beta was significant only between infant on TPN and control adults. When blood was stimulated with S. epidermidis, all 3 cytokines were significantly lower in the TPN group compared with control adults. However, the differences between infants on TPN and infant controls only reached statistical significance for IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response to bacterial challenge is impaired in infants on TPN compared with enterally fed infants or adults. The pattern of this response may be dependent on the nature of the microbial challenge. Our results indicate that the susceptibility of TPN-fed surgical infants to bacterial infections may in part be caused by impaired cytokine responses after bacterial invasion.
TI  - [Study of bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials in vitro].
AB  - This article reports a study of the bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials in vitro. The method for assessing the degree of bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials was established primarily. The capacities of staphylococcus aureus(SA), staphylococcus epidermidis(SE), Escherichia Coli(EC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PA) for adhesion to Dacron, Pyrolytic carbon and polytetrofluoroethylene (PTFE) were quantitatively determined by the plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125I radiolabeled bacteria in vitro. The results showed that the capacities of four types of bacteria for adhesion to Dacron, Pyrolytic carbon and PTFE coincided with the bacterial-growth curve. The capacities of four bacteria for adhering to Dacron were stronger. The adhesion of SE to Pyrolytic carbon was the strongest. The adhesion of PA Kept up a high level. The capacities of EC and PA for adhering to PTFE were the strongest. The results indicate that the capacities of different types of bacteria for adhesion to the same prosthetic valve material are different, and the capacities of one type of bacteria for adhesion to different materials are also different.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - A comparative study of carboxyfluorescein diacetate and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester as indicators of bacterial activity.
AB  - Staining bacteria with esterified fluorogenic substrates followed by flow cytometric analysis offers a means for rapid detection of metabolically active bacteria. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assess carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA/SE) as indicators of bacterial activity for cultured bacteria, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteria from environmental waters. In theory, CFDA/SE should be a better indicator of metabolic bacterial activity compared to CFDA due to greater intracellular retention of the fluorescent product. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of exponential phase cultures, mixtures of active and inactive cells and bacteria from environmental waters revealed CFDA was successful in detecting active bacteria, whereas CFDA/SE was not. CFDA/SE labelled inactive cells with intensities equal to that of the active population and could not even discriminate between bacteria in exponential phase growth and a fixed cell preparation. We propose that the specific mode of action of the succinimidyl ester (SE) group in combination with the nonenzymatic aqueous hydrolysis of the CFDA moiety results in the nonspecific labelling of all cells, irrespective of their metabolic state. This study shows that CFDA/SE is a poor marker of bacterial activity.
TI  - Prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern Italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
AB  - The epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in Lombardy (northern Italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). Overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), Staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). Unlike Escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. Rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. Escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). On the contrary, production of ESBL appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. Moreover, with regard to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among Enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. Multidrug resistance was commonly observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern Italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
AB  - We attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (UTI) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for UTI, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We examined eight species of bacteria ( Enterococcus avium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated UTI. It was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. The chromosomal DNA of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in PFGE. A comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. These results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. Based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by PFGE is a more effective method for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  - Human beta defensin 2 (hbetaD-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. We hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2, measured by reverse transcription-PCR, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetaD-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. Expression of hbetaD-2 was induced consistently by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of S. pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetaD-2. No correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2. S. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetaD-2 than S. epidermidis. We conclude that the ability to induce hbetaD-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetaD-2 expression by S. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. Induction of expression of hbetaD-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable S. epidermidis to survive on the skin surface and modulate hbetaD-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.
TI  - Subdural Empyema.
AB  - Subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. The empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. Intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. Provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against S. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. Morbidity and mortality in intracranial and spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. Both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on methanol extract of benincasa hispida cogn., fruit.
AB  - The methanol extract of wax gourd, the fruits of Benincasa hispida cogn.(Cucurbitaceae) was found to show no inhibition against three gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis and three gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia by cup-plate method whereas antifungal studies showed significant inhibition against Candida albicans in the concentration of 30 mg/ml and there was no inhibition against Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel chromosomal drug efflux gene in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A novel drug efflux gene (named sepA, staphylococcal efflux pump gene) is cloned  from antiseptic-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus into Escherichia coli. The sepA gene conferred the reduction of susceptibility to acriflavine and the acceleration of ethidium bromide efflux from the E. coli cells. The sepA (474 bp) encoded the protein that has four predicted transmembrane segments. These results indicate that sepA gene is a multidrug-resistant gene and encodes a drug efflux protein.
TI  - Activity of antimicrobial-impregnated silicone tissue expanders.
AB  - Because bacterial colonization of medical devices may result in clinical infection, it is conceivable that antimicrobial impregnation of tissue expanders may reduce the rate of infection. The objective of this in vitro study was to examine the spectrum, durability, and shelf-life antimicrobial activity of minocycline/rifampin-impregnated silicone tissue expander shells. The impregnated devices exhibited zones of inhibition at baseline against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The impregnated devices exhibited strong residual activity against S. epidermidis and S. aureus after suspension in serum at 37 degrees C for 4 weeks. There was no significant decrease in the size of zones of inhibition after storing the impregnated devices at room temperature for 1 year. These results indicate that minocycline/rifampin-impregnated tissue expander shells provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial activity and that the shelf-life antimicrobial activity exceeds 1 year. These findings prompt future exploration of the anti-infective efficacy of these antimicrobial-impregnated devices.
TI  - Superior antimicrobial activity of trisodium citrate over heparin for catheter locking.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis catheters used for vascular access are frequently complicated by infection and catheter-related thrombosis. Improvement of interdialytic locking solutions could reduce these problems. Trisodium citrate (TSC) has been advocated in recent years because it might have antimicrobial qualities. METHODS: Antimicrobial efficacy of four concentrations of TSC (2.2, 7.5, 15 and 30%) was compared with three equi-osmolal sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations, unfractionated heparin 5000 IU/ml and a solution of gentamicin 1 mg/ml in TSC 7.5%. We analysed antimicrobial properties by two classical in vitro susceptibility tests. All tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Increasing TSC concentrations effectively killed the staphylococcal strains in both assays. For E.coli and P.aeruginosa complete killing was achieved only with TSC 30%. TSC 30% was also the only solution that significantly inhibited growth of C.albicans. Heparin manifested no antimicrobial effect of any significance. Adding gentamicin to TSC provided superior bacterial growth inhibition but had no effect on yeast growth. TSC solutions manifested superior antimicrobial activity compared with iso-osmolal NaCl solutions in both assays. CONCLUSION: This in vitro study demonstrates superior antimicrobial activity of TSC, especially in higher concentrations, in contrast to heparin. The mechanism seems to differ from hyperosmolality. Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) chelating effects are probably more important. Adding gentamicin provided the most potent antimicrobial solution. However, for reasons concerning development of bacterial resistance and sensitization of the patient, continuous exposition to aminoglycosides seems not advisable.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - [Bacteria-selective synergism between the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and tachyplesin I: toward cocktail therapy].
AB  - Magainin 2 and tachyplesin I (T-SS) are membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides discovered in frog skin and horseshoe crab hemolymph, respectively. They are classified into different secondary structural classes, i.e., alpha-helix and cyclic beta-sheet, respectively. We found that F5W-magainin 2 (MG2) and T-SS showed marked synergistic effects against gram-negative and-positive bacteria without enhancing hemolytic activity as a measure of toxicity. The results of dye-release experiments using liposomes suggested that the selective synergism is mainly due to anionic phospholipid-specific synergism in membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, the cyclic structure of T-SS was found to be necessary for synergism because a linear analogue of T-SS did not show good synergism with MG2. These novel observations suggest the possibility of development of cocktail therapeutic regimens using combinations of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). About 80% of patients experience fever during aplasia and early engraftment despite oral antibacterial chemoprophylaxis. METHODS: In a pilot study, 50 patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT received a prophylactic antibacterial treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam beginning on day of stem cell or bone marrow transfusion. They were analyzed retrospectively for frequencies of fever of unknown origin (FUO), documented infection, bacteremia and death because of infection. Furthermore, data from microbiological monitoring and tolerability were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 28 autologous transplanted patients, 10 (36%) developed fever more than 38.5 degrees C; 9/10 FUO, 1/28 pulmonary infiltrates. Eighteen patients (64%) remained without any symptom of infection. In the allogeneic group (n = 22), there were eight patients (36%) with FUO, and five patients (23%) with documented infections (pneumonia 2, enteritis 1, pyelonephritis 1, Escherichia coli bacteremia 1). In nine patients (41%), escalation of antimicrobial treatment was not necessary. The majority of detected microbes in cultures of throat and nose secretions, blood, urine and stool were gram-positive bacteria (77.8%), among them Staphylococcus epidermidis (23.5%), streptococci (group A, B, C; 21.0%) and enterococci (10.6%). Incidence of gram-negative bacteria and fungi was similar with 11.8% and 10.4%, respectively. The most frequent gram-negative strains were Escherichia coli (6.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.7%). There was no severe toxicity or hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: Compared to oral decontamination and chemoprophylaxis, an intravenous prophylactic regimen as described above could be an effective and well-tolerated approach in prevention of bacterial infections and related complications, with a higher acceptance in recipients of bone marrow or stems cell grafts. Further evaluation in comparison with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis regarding efficacy, development of resistances as well as cost-benefit analyses is warranted.
TI  - Conservative medical therapy of infections following osteosynthesis: a retrospective analysis of a six-year experience.
AB  - The conventional therapeutic approach to bone infection associated with osteosynthesis is based on the idea that microbial eradication is most readily achieved by removal of the foreign material together with adequate antimicrobial therapy. This strategy usually requires implantation of external fixation devices with additional discomfort to the patient. We report our experience with conservative medical and antimicrobial therapy without removal of the osteosynthesis until adequate bone callus deposition is documented by bone radiography scan. Twenty patients with infections associated with intramedullary nailing (9 patients), screws and plate (9 patients) or screws (2 patients) were treated between 1995 to 2000. Osteosynthesis implantation sites were tibia (7 patients), femur (6 patients), femur and tibia (1 patient), humerus (1 patient), others (5 patients). Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence and confirmed by 99Tc-labeled leukocyte scan studies. Offending pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus 17 cases, Staphylococcus aureus + Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, unknown, 1 case each. Most infections were initially treated with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampin followed by oral antimicrobial therapy usually with ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampin. Mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 27.7 weeks (range 12-64 weeks). All patients (100%) were cured, and none complained of side-effects requiring antibiotic therapy discontinuation. We conclude that conservative medical therapy is feasible for osteosynthesis-associated bone infection.
TI  - Serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because the effect of CPB on serum drug levels is poorly understood. Current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. Few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. This study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin in CPB surgery. METHODS: This prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent CABG surgery. We compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. RESULTS: Serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the MIC90, for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. The serum levels fell below the MIC90 for Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum cefazolin levels during CPB remained consistently above the MIC for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder. Additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - Is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  - There is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. Is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? Seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital day surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. Surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. Of the 731 children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin preparation and on completion of the operation. Staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by Escherichia coli (19%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%), while S. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. The efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. In only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (S. aureus and S. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. Cultures taken at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly S. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). Children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and had passed urine. The wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. Follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the Southampton Wound Assessment Scale. Ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. Our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. Routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. Only 1.5% of postoperative cases will require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Biological activity of common mullein, a medicinal plant.
AB  - Common Mullein (Verbascum thapsus L., Scrophulariaceae) is a medicinal plant that has been used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, asthma, spasmodic coughs, diarrhea and other pulmonary problems. The objective of this study was to assess the biological activity of Common Mullein extracts and commercial Mullein products using selected bench top bioassays, including antibacterial, antitumor, and two toxicity assays--brine shrimp and radish seed. Extracts were prepared in water, ethanol and methanol. Antibacterial activity (especially the water extract) was observed with Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced tumors in potato disc tissue were inhibited by all extracts. Toxicity to Brine Shrimp and to radish seed germination and growth was observed at higher concentrations of the extracts.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of meropenem and ciprofloxacin in the presence of 5-fluorouracil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of meropenem and ciprofloxacin was studied in the presence of the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the PAEs of the combinations differed from the PAEs of the antibiotics alone. METHODS: The PAEs of the combinations of 5-FU plus meropenem or ciprofloxacin were determined with viable counts against four reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. The results were compared with the PAEs of the antibiotics drugs and 5-FU alone. The gram-positive strains were tested for slime production, both alone and in the presence of 5-FU. RESULTS: Against two of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis, the combination of ciprofloxacin and 5-FU gave a synergistic prolongation of the PAE in comparison with the PAEs induced by the drugs alone. The combinations showed indifference against the other bacteria. The combination of meropenem and 5-FU had a synergistic PAE against one of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis and an additive effect against E. coli but showed indifference against the rest of the strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 5-FU did not influence the PAEs of the antibiotics against most of the tested strains, but caused a synergistic prolongation of the PAEs induced by ciprofloxacin and meropenem against some of the tested strains of S. epidermidis. 5-FU inhibited slime production in the same S. epidermidis strains, which might have contributed to the longer PAE.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Is the GehD lipase from Staphylococcus epidermidis a collagen binding adhesin?
AB  - The opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is the major cause of nosocomial biomaterial infections. S. epidermidis has the ability to attach to indwelling materials coated with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. To identify the proteins necessary for S. epidermidis attachment to collagen, we screened an expression library using digoxigenin-labeled collagen as well as two monoclonal antibodies generated against the Staphylococcus aureus collagen-adhesin, Cna, as probes. These monoclonal antibodies recognize collagen binding epitopes on the surface of S. aureus and S. epidermidis cells. Using this approach, we identified GehD, the extracellular lipase originally found in S. epidermidis 9, as a collagen-binding protein. Despite the monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity, the GehD amino acid sequence and predicted structure are radically different from those of Cna. The mature GehD circular dichroism spectra differs from that of Cna but strongly resembles that of a mammalian cell-surface collagen binding receptor, known as the alpha(1) integrin I domain, suggesting that they have similar secondary structures. The GehD protein is translated as a preproenzyme, secreted, and post-translationally processed into mature lipase. GehD does not have the conserved LPXTG C-terminal motif present in cell wall-anchored proteins, but it can be detected in lysostaphin cell wall extracts. A recombinant version of mature GehD binds to collagens type I, II, and IV adsorbed onto microtiter plates in a dose-dependent saturable manner. Recombinant, mature GehD protein and anti-GehD antibodies can inhibit the attachment of S. epidermidis to immobilized collagen. These results provide evidence that GehD may be a bi-functional molecule, acting not only as a lipase but also as a cell surface-associated collagen adhesin.
TI  - Transposase-dependent formation of circular IS256 derivatives in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - IS256 is a highly active insertion sequence (IS) element of multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. Here we show that, in a Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolate, as well as in recombinant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli carrying a single IS256 insertion on a plasmid, IS256 excises as an extrachromosomal circular DNA molecule. First, circles were identified that contained a complete copy of IS256. In this case, the sequence connecting the left and right ends of IS256 was derived from flanking DNA sequences of the parental genetic locus. Second, circle junctions were detected in which one end of IS256 was truncated. Nucleotide sequencing of circle junctions revealed that (i) either end of IS256 can attack the opposite terminus and (ii) the circle junctions vary significantly in size. Upon deletion of the IS256 open reading frame at the 3' end and site-directed mutageneses of the putative DDE motif, circular IS256 molecules were no longer detectable, which implicates the IS256-encoded transposase protein with the circularization of the element.
TI  - Assessment of PEO/PTMO multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  - The effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. In this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (SPU) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. When exposed to PBS (pH 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. It was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare SPU, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. Of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in S. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare SPU with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. By using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. The duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. The superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their PEO-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of PEO phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids haminol and pulo'upone and related compounds.
AB  - The marine alkaloids haminol A, haminol B and pulo'upone as well as 17 related compounds (twelve 2-substituted pyridine derivatives, four 3-substituted ones and one analogue of the bicyclic terminus of pulo'upone) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of six microbes (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the paper disc agar diffusion method. Six compounds were tested also against the mold Aspergillus niger. Some of the compounds displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, only one congener being completely devoid of activity. Nearly all compounds had activity against B. cereus and S. epidermidis. The growth of E. coli, C albicans and S. cerevisiae was also distinctly inhibited by many compounds. In contrast, most compounds were inactive or had minimal activity against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, most of the compounds tested against the opportunistic pathogen A. niger were active, one of them having noteworthy inhibitory potency.
TI  - Characterization and molecular cloning of a glutamyl endopeptidase from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - A novel extracellular endopeptidase, designated GluSE, was purified from Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 cultured by the dialysis membrane technique, and the structural gene (gseA) was cloned. GluSE was a 27kDa, glutamic acid-specific protease, and the optimal pH was 8.0. The proteolytic activity was specifically inhibited with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that it is a serine protease. The gseA encoded a single polypeptide of 282 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 30,809, in which the first 19 N-terminal amino acids completely matched the deduced sequence starting at Val-67, suggesting that GluSE is synthesized with a propeptide. The amino acid sequence of GluSE exhibited 50.5% identity to Staphylococcus aureus V8-protease (GluV8). Although GluSE lacks a C-terminal 12 repeats of the PBN/PBZ tripeptide of GluV8, a catalytic triad of His-117, Asp-159 and Ser-235 was conserved in GluSE. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that gseA exists as a single copy on the chromosomal DNA. The finding that production of GluSE was obviously observed in the adherent culture conditions of the dialysis membrane technique, but not in the planktonic culture conditions, strongly suggests that GluSE could be involved in an important etiologic process in S.epidermidis infection leading to multiple tissue damages.
TI  - Cancer prevention and therapy with kiwifruit in Chinese folklore medicine: a study of kiwifruit extracts.
AB  - Kiwi gold fruits were extracted successively with hexane, acetone, methanol and 70% methanol, and further fractionated by silica gel and ODS column chromatographies for the assays of various biological activities. Five fractions H1, H2 (hexane extract), Al, A2 (acetone extract) and M2 (methanol extract) showed selective cytotoxic activity against human oral tumor cell lines, which was more sensitive than human gingival fibroblasts. More hydrophilic fractions [70M3, 70M4, 70M5] of 70% methanol extract displayed higher anti-HIV activity, radical generation and O2- scavenging activity. The antibacterial activity of 70% methanol extracts [70M0, 70M1, 70M2, 70M3, 70M4] was generally lower than that of more lipophilic fractions (hexane, acetone, methanol extracts), although each fraction did not show any specific antimicrobial action. All fractions were inactive against Helicobacter pylori. These results demonstrate that gold kiwifruit extracts contain valuable, various bioactive materials, which can be separated with each other.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - The outer membrane localization of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae MsrA/B is involved in survival against reactive oxygen species.
AB  - The PilB protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been reported to be involved in the regulation of pilin gene transcription, but it also possesses significant homology to the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase family of enzymes, specifically MsrA and MsrB from Escherichia coli. MsrA and MsrB in E. coli are able to reduce methionine sulfoxide residues in proteins to methionines. In addition, the gonococcal PilB protein encodes for both MsrA and MsrB activity associated with the repair of oxidative damage to proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that the PilB protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is not involved in pilus expression. Additionally, we show that wild-type N. gonorrhoeae produces two forms of this polypeptide, one of which contains a signal sequence and is secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm to the outer membrane; the other lacks a signal sequence and is cytoplasmic. Furthermore, we show that the secreted form of the PilB protein is involved in survival in the presence of oxidative damage.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological activities of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 2-substituted-4-methyl-7-amino/4,7-dimethyl-1,8-naphthyridines were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The compounds were investigated for anticonvulsant (125, 250 mg/kg), cardiac and antimicrobial activities. The compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcusfaecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and gram (-) bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). All the compounds except 2-(3'-phenylaminopropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activity of 2-(3-morpholino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diethanolamino-propyloxy)-4,7-dimethy-1,8-naphthyridine at the dose of 250 mg/kg were found to be equivalent to diazepam (5 mg/kg). Sympathetic blocking activity was observed with 2-(3'-phenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diethanolamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine only. All the compounds were devoid of antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - Purification of lactoperoxidase from creek-water buffalo milk and investigation of kinetic and antibacterial properties.
AB  - Water buffalo lactoperoxidase (WBLP) was purified with Amberlite CG 50 H+ resin,  CM Sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. All purification steps of the WBLP were shown with SDS-PAGE and Rz (A412/A280) controlled the purification degree of the enzyme. Rz value for the purified WBLP was 0.8. To determine purification steps and kinetic properties, the activity of enzyme was measured by using 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH=6. Km, Vmax, optimum pH, and optimum temperature for the WBLP were found by means of graphics for ABTS as substrates. Optimum pH and optimum temperature of the WBLP were 6 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Km value at optimum pH and optimum temperature for the WBLP was 0.82 mM. Vmax value at optimum pH and optimum temperature was 13.7 micromol/mL x min. Km value at optimum pH and 25 degrees C for the WBLP was 0.77 mM. Vmax value at optimum pH and 25 degrees C was 4.83 micromol/mL x min. The purified WBLP was found to have high antibacterial activity in a thiocynate-H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginose, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus saphrophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Shigella dysenteriae and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as tetracycline, penicillin, and netilmicine.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis. Epidemiological study of the Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") were prospectively studied. Bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (CSF) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when CSF culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. RESULTS: During the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. Transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. The incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). No risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. Group B Streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases of confirmed meningitis and Escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. In 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). Thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. The incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in VLBW infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). Two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. E. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 24.5 %. In 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. Mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in Spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. The most commonly isolated pathogens were group B Streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and E. coli and S. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. We believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. The high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution in patients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  - This study evaluated the potential for bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution after 3 days of clinical use in patients. Twenty patients with upper respiratory infection used the saline as a spray, and 20 patients used the solution as drops. Bacterial growth was present in 18 (907%) solution containers of the spray group and in 3 (157%) solution containers of the drops group (P <.005). Twenty isolates were recovered from the spray group and 3 from the drops group. The predominate isolates included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha Streptococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus spp. This study demonstrates the contamination of nasal saline-dispensing solution used as a spray with micro-organisms that are part of the normal skin and nasal flora and gram-negative organisms of potential enteric origin. These data support the use of nasal saline-dispensing solution as drops, rather than as spray. They also illustrate the risk for crossinfection if a nasal solution is used by more than 1 patient.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
AB  - In this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (PHEMA-20% DMAEMA), polyurethane (PU), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (PLGA), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (BHK 21) cells and epithelial Madine Darby kidney (MDBK) cells. Biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. Surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. The bacteria used were; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus B-13. Initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. The adhesion behaviour of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. However, the percentage of attached E. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while L. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. The comparative results indicated that the adhesion of BHK and MDBK cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic PHEMA surface and highest on the most hydrophobic PP surface. In contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
TI  - [Frequency and etiology of seminal infections in the study of infertile couples].
AB  - Male genital infections are a relevant cause in the etiology of infertility, due  to abnormalities in sperm quality, affecting spermatozoal count and motility. OBJECTIVE: Identify the most common bacteria isolated from seminal cultures and their impact on seminal quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal and observational study was performed by reviewing 295 files of infertile males seen in our clinic of Reproductive Biology at the Hospital Juarez de Mexico, in whom seminogram and seminal cultures were practiced for detection of seminal infection and quality assessment. RESULTS: 47% of cases presented infection by one or two bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus (alpha and beta hemolitic) and Escherichia coli prevailed. The main alterations in quality were motility, pH, morphology and viscosity in association with S. epidermidis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of our group of study disclosed seminal infections and it resembled the percentages reported in the literature; most of them were asymptomatic. In disparity with other reports the most common bacterial agent found in association with changes in seminal quality was a skin saprophyte.
TI  - Prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections in 14 Greek hospitals: planning  from the local to the national surveillance level.
AB  - A prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) was carried out in 14 of 112 Greek hospitals (15.7%), scattered throughout Greece. Five of seven Greek university hospitals and nine regional hospitals participated in the one-day study, and 3925 hospitalized patients (10.5% of the total hospital beds in Greece) were recorded. The aim of this project was to organize a surveillance of HAI with the participation of the greatest possible number of Greek hospitals, transferring the experience from the local Cretan infection control network in an effort to create a nationwide network. Special attention was paid to recruit all Greek university hospitals in our attempt to expand the study base. Co-ordination of the participating centres, education of the infection control teams on surveillance methods, preparation of agreed definitions, and elaboration of the protocol for the collection of the data were the major objectives of this study. The difficulties, however, were limited resources and the lack of skilled personnel. The overall prevalence of HAI was found to be 9.3%. The most common HAI recorded involved lower respiratory tract infections (30.3%), followed by urinary tract infections (22.7%), bloodstream infections (15.8%), and surgical site infections (14.8%). The greatest prevalence rate was found in the adult ICU (48.4%), followed by the neonatal ICU (30.3%). The duration of hospitalization, the number of operations, the total number of used devices and invasive procedures were significantly correlated with HAI. Positive cultures were found in 51.5% of the cases. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%). The administration of antibiotics was also recorded. The prevalence of antibiotic use was 51.4%.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis of nosocomial origin: an epidemiological study from the "Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo".
AB  - A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the frequency, etiology, and mortality of nosocomial neonatal sepsis diagnosed between 1996 and 1997 in the neonatology services of 27 acute-care hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo"). Nosocomial sepsis is defined in the literature using chronological criteria (> 3-7 days of life at the onset of symptoms); accordingly, there is the possibility of including late-onset maternally acquired sepsis or of excluding early-onset nosocomial sepsis (< 3-7 days of life). For these reasons, in this study, cases of nosocomial sepsis that developed at < or = 3-7 days after birth (early onset) were also recorded and maternally acquired sepsis diagnosed beyond 3-7 days of life were excluded. Using these criteria in a total of 30,993 admissions to the neonatal units of the participating hospitals, the nosocomial sepsis rate was 2.1% with an incidence density of 0.89 per 1000 patient days. Sepsis rate was significantly more frequent among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (15.6%) than among those weighing > or = 1500 g (1.16%) (P < 0.001). Fifty-eight percent of all isolates were Gram-positive organisms, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis (42%). Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 29.5% of cases (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were the most commonly isolated pathogens) and fungal infections in 12%, with absolute predominance of Candida spp. The overall mortality rate was 11.8% and the following subgroups had significantly higher (P < 0.001) mortality rates: sepsis caused by Gram-negative organisms (19% vs. 5.1% in Gram-positive pathogens) and sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.3% vs. 9.4% for the total number of sepsis caused by the remaining causative pathogens). Sepsis caused by S. epidermidis showed a significantly lower mortality rate (5.5%) compared with overall sepsis for the remaining etiologies (14.2%) (P < 0.001). In VLBW infants, the mortality rate was significantly higher than in infants weighing > 1500 g (17.3% vs. 6.5%, P < 0.001).
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cAM373 activity in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The sex pheromone cAM373 of Enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cAM373 of Staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the C-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. The deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. The chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated camE (encoding cAM373) and camS (encoding staph-cAM373). Truncated and full-length clones of camE were generated in Escherichia coli, in which cAM373 activity was expressed. In E. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of camE had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. Establishment of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cAM373 activity to 3% of normal levels. The camS determinant has homologues in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cAM373 closely. The particular significance of staph-cAM373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.
TI  - Fiberoptic intraparenchymal brain pressure monitoring with the Camino V420 monitor: reflections on our experience in 163 severely head-injured patients.
AB  - To assess the safety and accuracy of the Camino intraparenchymal sensor, we prospectively evaluated hemorrhagic complications, zero-drift, infection, and system malfunction in 163 patients monitored after a severe head injury. Mean duration of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was 5 +/- 2.2 days (range: 12 h to 11 days). Of the 141 patients with a control CT scan, four showed a 1-2-cc collection of blood at the catheter's end. When removed, the sensors underread the true ICP value (negative zero-drift) in 80 of the 126 sensors evaluated (63.5%). Fourteen sensors showed no zero-drift, and 32 sensors overread the true ICP value (positive zero-drift) (median: -1 mm Hg; interquartile range: -4 to +1 mm Hg). No significant relationship was found between zero-drift, the surgeon who implanted the sensor, intracranial hypertension, or duration of ICP monitoring. No clinical infections could be attributed to the devices. Sixteen patients (9.8%) required more than one ICP sensor due to malfunctioning of the system. In conclusion, continuous ICP monitoring using the Camino intraparenchymal sensor has a low complication rate. However, this sensor may underread the real ICP values in a high number of patients. The lack of correlation between duration of ICP monitoring and zero-drift suggests that, contrary to the recommendations of other reports, the intraparenchymatous Camino sensor can provide reliable readings after the fifth day of use.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - [Can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). A microbiological diagnosis can be made by examination of a urine sample, and in Danish family practice the diagnosis of UTI is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. These methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. The aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. No prior instruction in testing procedure was given. As the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the Department of Microbiology, University of Southern Denmark, were used. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. The corresponding figures for urine culture were 95% and 96%. The morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified correctly in terms of their motility. DISCUSSION: The results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Regarding "Limitations in the use of rifampicin-gelatin grafts against virulent organisms".
AB  
TI  - Limitations in the use of rifampicin-gelatin grafts against virulent organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Efficacy and duration of antibacterial activity of rifampicin-gelatin  grafts against virulent organisms were evaluated in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rifampicin-gelatin grafts were prepared with impregnation of Gelseal (Vascutek Ltd, Scotland) graft in 1 mg/mL rifampicin solution. Rifampicin-gelatin grafts (6 cm long; n = 24) and plain Gelseal grafts as controls (n = 4) were implanted into the canine abdominal aorta with inoculation of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the rifampicin-gelatin grafts were retrieved after 1 to 4 weeks. Disks cut from the retrieved rifampicin-gelatin grafts were placed on agar plates streaked with one of the organisms, and the graft antibacterial activity was assessed with the width of the inhibition zone. RESULTS: In in vitro tests, initial inhibition zones (inhibition zone of 24 hours after incubation) of rifampicin-gelatin grafts against S epidermidis, MRSA, and E coli were 40.0 +/- 0.3 mm, 36.0 +/- 0.2 mm, and 11.8 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively. In the implantation, S epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts had no findings of graft infection, and no colony growth was recognized on the plates streaked with the perigraft fluids. Initial inhibition zones of S epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts retrieved at 1 or 2 weeks were 20.1 +/- 1.1 mm and 7.6 +/- 1.0 mm, respectively. In E coli -inoculated and MRSA-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts, all of the eight animals had perigraft abscess, and blood culture test results probed septicemia in five animals with patent grafts at death. Inhibition zones against E coli or MRSA were not formed on the plates streaked with the same organism, whereas initial inhibition zones of E coli -inoculated and MRSA-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts on S epidermidis -streaked plates were 8.0 +/- 0.2 mm and 18.5 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively. In the MRSA group, however, recolonization of high minimal inhibitory concentration strains developed within the inhibition zones as early as 24 hours. Histologically, neither organisms nor inflammatory cells were found in S epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts and tissue ingrowth was recognized at 2 to 4 weeks, whereas E coli -inoculated and MRSA-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts had aggressive neutrophil infiltration into the graft interstices, revealing establishment of uncontrollable graft infection. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that rifampicin-gelatin grafts are clearly valid for S epidermidis infection, whereas no efficacy was recognized against either MRSA or E coli graft infection because of early development of high minimal inhibitory concentration MRSA strains or poor susceptibility.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - MEN 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in vitro antibacterial activity on clinical isolates.
AB  - MEN 10700 is a new broad-spectrum penem, currently in preclinical development. In the present study, the activity of MEN 10700 was compared to that of imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin against 619 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, and to that of imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime and ampicillin/sulbactam against 38 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, and against 19 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of the KES group. MEN 10700 was highly active against most gram-positive and gram-negative strains, and overall demonstrated comparable activity to imipenem and meropenem. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis were highly susceptible to MEN 10700, which was the most potent among the antibiotics tested. MEN 10700 was less potent than the carbapenem antibiotics on Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter spp. Ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli were uniformly susceptible to MEN 10700, imipenem and meropenem, with MIC90 values in the range of < or = 0.12-0.25 mg/l, while showing much lower susceptibility to the other antibiotics tested, including the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. This feature was even more evident in ESBL-producing strains of the KES group, with an MIC90 of 1- 2 mg/l for MEN 10700, imipenem and meropenem, and a MIC90 of 16-64 mg/l for the other antibiotics tested, including cefepime.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is  often fatal. Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness. Viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with Gram-negative organisms. An increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. Distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. Recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. The resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. Early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. For empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive organisms should be used. A carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic. Therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. Effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. Of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus O-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. To reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. This study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% o-phenylphenol. METHODS: The organisms used were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228), and from our clinical collection (Proteus mirabilis CH 14, Klebsiella oxytoca CH 22, Serratia liquefaciens CH 90). MIC and MBC were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. The contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The results showed that MIC values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. The MBC values were similar or higher than the MIC. The disinfectant solution killed E. coli and C. albicans already after 10 min, but for S. aureus 30 min was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that this solution attained the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of covalently coupled quaternary ammonium silane coatings on silicone rubber.
AB  - Biomaterial-centered infection is a dreaded complication associated with the use  of biomedical implants. In this paper, the antimicrobial activity of silicone rubber with a covalently coupled 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (QAS) coating was studied in vitro and in vivo. Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH, 102, and Gram-negative Esherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginos AK1 were seeded on silicone rubber with and without QAS-coating, in the absence or presence of adsorbed human plasma proteins. The viability of the adherent bacteria was determined using a live/dead fluorescent stain and a confocal laser scanning microscope. The coating reduced the viability of adherent staphylococci from 90% to 0%), and of Gram-negative bacteria from 90% to 25% while the presencc of adsorbed plasma proteins had little influence. The biomaterials were also subcutaneously implanted in rats for 3 or 7 days, while pre- or postoperatively seeded with S. aureus ATCC 12600. Preoperative seeding resulted in infection of 7 out of 8 silicone rubber implants against 1 out of 8 QAS-coated silicone rubber implants. Postoperative seeding resulted in similar infection incidences on both implant types, but the numbers of adhering bacteria were 70% lower on QAS-coated silicone rubber. In conclusion, QAS-coated silicone rubber shows antimicrobial properties against adhering bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, Xenopus tropicalis (Pipidae).
AB  - Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.
TI  - Grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. This work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. Differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. CONCLUSIONS: The nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. The smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 FLB ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards K. pneumoniae. The larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.
TI  - First results using automated epifluorescence microscopy to detect Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis in WBC-reduced platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many methods have been tested for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelets. However, only those using molecular biology or cell culturing consistently detect contamination at levels below 10(5) bacteria per mL. This report describes the initial investigation into an alternative method that offers the possibilities of high sensitivity and rapid response while using available laboratory equipment and supplies. This method relies on a fluorescent nucleic acid stain, which preferentially stains bacteria but not platelets, and automated epifluorescence microscopy for rapid analysis. Measurements in WBC-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) contaminated with bacteria are reported at concentrations between 10(3) and 10(6) bacteria per mL. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli was inoculated into aliquots of WBC-reduced PCs on Days 2 through 5 of storage. Bacterially inoculated and control PCs were stained, platelets and residual WBCs were lysed, and 200 microL of sample was filtered onto black polycarbonate filters. All preparations were done in triplicate. An automated epifluorescence microscope examined approximately 2 percent of the area of each filter and used image analysis to select the fluorescent particles that should be counted as bacteria. RESULTS: Samples containing 3 to 5 x 10(3) bacteria per mL produced about three times as many fluorescent particles classified as bacteria as the controls. Lower concentrations of S. epidermidis were detected because of higher fluorescence intensity. Simultaneous preparation of six samples requires about 35 minutes. Analysis of each prepared sample takes 10 minutes, for a total preparation and analysis time of about 95 minutes for 6 samples. CONCLUSION: Low concentrations (<5 x 10(3) bacteria/mL) of deliberately inoculated S. epidermidis or E. coli can be measured quickly in WBC-depleted PCs by using a fluorescent nucleic acid stain, differential lysis, and automated microscopy. Continued refinement of the method, studies employing other bacterial strains, and further validations of assay performance are warranted.
TI  - Quantification of expression of Staphylococcus epidermidis housekeeping genes with Taqman quantitative PCR during in vitro growth and under different conditions.
AB  - The aims of the present study were (i) to develop and test a sensitive and reproducible method for the study of gene expression in staphylococci and (ii) to study the expression of five housekeeping genes which are involved in nucleic acid metabolism (gmk, guanylate kinase; the dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] gene), glucose metabolism (tpi, triosephosphate isomerase), and protein metabolism (the 16S rRNA gene; hsp-60, heat-shock protein 60) during in vitro exponential and stationary growth. A modified method for instant mRNA isolation was combined with gene quantification via Taqman real-time quantitative PCR. The detection limit of our method was 10 copies of RNA. The average intersample variability was 16%. A 10-fold increase in the expression of the hsp-60 gene was induced by exposure to a 10 degrees C heat shock (37 to 47 degrees C) for 10 min. During in vitro growth, the expression of all five housekeeping genes showed rapid up-regulation after inoculation of the bacteria in brain heart infusion medum and started to decline during the mid-exponential-growth phase. Maximal gene expression was 110- to 300-fold higher than gene expression during stationary phase. This indicates that housekeeping metabolism is a very dynamic process that is extremely capable of adapting to different growth conditions. Expression of the 16S rRNA gene decreases significantly earlier than that of other housekeeping genes. This confirms earlier findings for Escherichia coli that a decline in bacterial ribosomal content (measured by 16S rRNA gene expression) precedes the decline in protein synthesis (measured by mRNA expression).
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel 38.5-kilodalton cell surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus with extended-spectrum binding activity for extracellular matrix and plasma proteins.
AB  - The ability to attach to host ligands is a well-established pathogenic factor in  invasive Staphylococcus aureus disease. In addition to the family of adhesive proteins bound to the cell wall via the sortase A (srtA) mechanism, secreted proteins such as the fibrinogen-binding protein Efb, the extracellular adhesion protein Eap, or coagulase have been found to interact with various extracellular host molecules. Here we describe a novel protein, the extracellular matrix protein-binding protein (Emp) initially identified in Western ligand blots as a 40-kDa protein due to its broad-spectrum recognition of fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, and vitronectin. Emp is expressed in the stationary growth phase and is closely associated with the cell surface and yet is extractable by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The conferring gene emp (1,023 nucleotides) encodes a signal peptide of 26 amino acids and a mature protein of a calculated molecular mass of 35.5 kDa. Using PCR, emp was demonstrated in all 240 S. aureus isolates of a defined clinical strain collection as well as in 6 S. aureus laboratory strains, whereas it is lacking in all 10 S. epidermidis strains tested. Construction of an allelic replacement mutant (mEmp50) revealed the absence of Emp in mEmp50, a significantly decreased adhesion of mEmp50 to immobilized fibronectin and fibrinogen, and restoration of these characteristics upon complementation of mEmp50. Emp expression was also demonstrable upon heterologous complementation of S. carnosus. rEmp expressed in Escherichia coli interacted with fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin in surface plasmon resonance experiments at a K(d) of 21 nM, 91 nM, and 122 pM, respectively. In conclusion, the biologic characterization of Emp suggests that it is a member of the group of secreted S. aureus molecules that interact with an extended spectrum of host ligands and thereby contribute to S. aureus pathogenicity.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Effect of vaginal Lactobacillus metabolites on biological properties of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli].
AB  - The influence of supernatants and cell extracts of vaginal lactic acid bacilli on the growth, catalase, antilysozyme and anticomplementary activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli was studied. Changes observed in the persistence characteristics of these microorganisms were found to develop in different directions: in S. epidermidis a decrease in antilysozyme activity was mainly observed, while in E. coli the suppression of anticomplementary activity was registered. The modifying influence of lactic acid flora, revealed in this investigation, is regarded as one of the mechanisms facilitating the formation of microbiocenosis and ensuring colonization resistance.
TI  - RL-37, an alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide of the rhesus monkey.
AB  - Rhesus monkey bone marrow expresses a cathelicidin whose C-terminal domain comprises a 37-residue alpha-helical peptide (RL-37) that resembles human LL-37. Like its human counterpart, RL-37 rapidly permeabilized the membranes of Escherichia coli ML-35p and lysed liposomes that simulated bacterial membranes. When tested in media whose NaCl concentrations approximated those of extracellular fluids, RL-37 was considerably more active than LL-37 against staphylococci. Whereas human LL-37 contains five acidic residues and has a net charge of +6, rhesus RL-37 has only two acidic residues and a net charge of +8. Speculating that the multiple acidic residues of human LL-37 reduced its efficacy against staphylococci, we made a peptide (LL-37 pentamide) in which each aspartic acid of LL-37 was replaced by an asparagine and each glutamic acid was replaced by a glutamine. LL-37 pentamide's antistaphylococcal activity was substantially greater than that of LL-37. Thus, although the precursor of LL-37 is induced in human skin keratinocytes by injury or inflammation, its insufficiently cationic antimicrobial domain may contribute to the success of staphylococci in colonizing and infecting human skin.
TI  - [Experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  - The in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "Photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. The photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. Irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. The irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. The results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.
TI  - The significance of asymptomatic bacteremia for the newborn.
AB  - BACKGROUND: So far, there has been no systematic detection of asymptomatic bacteremia in pregnant women. Consequently, its possible effects on newborn infants have not been discussed. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of asymptomatic bacteremia in pregnant and parturient women and neonates as well as to assess its influence on the health condition of newborn infants during the first three months of life. METHODS: A total of 626 blood cultures were taken from 353 pregnant women (with single-fetus pregnancy)and their newborns: 156 during pregnancy, and immediately after delivery from 235 mothers and their 235 newborns. Blood culture results were clinically and statistically analyzed along with data on the development of the newborns. RESULTS: Positive blood culture was found in 12% of pregnant women, in 19% of parturient women and 25% of the newborns. The most often isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus epidermidis in 36 cases (18%), Escherichia coli in 35 cases (17.5%) and Enterococcus in 20 cases (10%). Asymptomatic bacteremia was found to be in a statistically significant correlation with signs and symptoms of life-threatening conditions (p<0.01), early-onset and late-onset infections and other disorders occurring in newborn infants (p<0.05), mostly of the female sex. CONCLUSION: It seems that asymptomatic bacteremia cannot be considered harmless but appears to influence the health of newborns.
TI  - Samioside, a new phenylethanoid glycoside with free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities from Phlomis samia.
AB  - A new phenylethanoid glycoside, samioside, was isolated from the aerial parts of  Phlomis samia and identified as 1-O-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4-O-caffeoyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside (1). In addition, one known phenylethanoid glycoside and three known flavonoids were identified as acteoside (2), apigenin, chrysoeriol, and ermanin, respectively. The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of its spectroscopic data. Samioside (1) demonstrated scavenging properties toward the DPPH radical and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparison of translocation of different types of microorganisms from the intestinal tract of burned mice.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the ability of various microorganisms to translocate from the intestine to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), liver, and spleen in a burned mouse model. Balb/c mice were gavaged with 1 x 10(9) or 1 x 10(10) of one of 11 different microorganisms. All animals were then given a 20% burn. Survival after 10 days showed no significant difference between any of the groups at the 10(10) dose. At the 10(9) dose, significantly higher survival rates were found in three of the 11 strains. Microbial translocation (gavage of 10(10) 111In-labeled organisms) and host's ability to kill translocated bacteria (viable bacteria in tissues) were measured followed by burn injury and sacrifice four hours later. Translocation and killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli was high in the MLNs compared with all other groups but translocation was lower to the liver. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Serratia translocated more evenly to all the tissues. However, these groups showed very high clearance of bacteria in the liver and spleen except for Klebsiella and one strain of Pseudomonas in the spleen. Candida showed poor translocation to all of the tissues and high clearance. It is concluded that various strains of bacteria translocate from the intestine to a similar degree after injury, but the tissues to which they translocate and the rate at which they are killed are somewhat strain dependent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - UV Raman spectral intensities of E. coli and other bacteria excited at 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm.
AB  - Resonance Raman spectral intensities per average bacterial cell have been measured quantitatively for Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, as well as Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spectra have been obtained from cultures in the lag, log, and stationary growth phases excited in turn by 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm light. Although Raman spectral peak positions (cm(-1)) excited by a given wavelength are very similar for all five bacterial species, the organisms are characterized by significantly different spectral intensity values. Intensity changes are associated with growth phase changes in all of the species as well. A comparison of measured with estimated average intensities has been made for spectra of log-phase E. coli. It is possible to compare measured intensities with intensities estimated for log-phase E. coli on the basis of the knowledge of its known average cellular molecular composition. A significant degree of hypochromism is observed in E. coli nucleic acid spectra. In contrast, strong average hyperchromism characterizes all aromatic amino acid peaks belonging to the same E. coli cells. Results suggest that knowledge of spectral intensity values will enhance significantly the capability to identify bacteria by means of their UV resonance Raman spectra.
TI  - Assessment of resistance towards biocides following the attachment of micro-organisms to, and growth on, surfaces.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a rapid method for the assessment of biocidal activity directed  towards intact biofilms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were cultured for up to 48 h within 96-well microtitre plates. The planktonic phase was removed and the wells rinsed. Residual biofilms were exposed to various concentrations of chloroxylenol, peracetic acid, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), cetrimide or phenoxyethanol for 1 h. At 15-min intervals, biocide was removed, and the wells washed in neutraliser and filled with volumes of fresh medium. Re-growth of the cultures was monitored during incubation at 35 degrees C in the plate reader. Times taken for the treated wells to re-grow to fixed endpoints were determined and related to numbers of surviving cells. Time--survival curves were constructed and the survival of the attached bacteria, following exposure to the agents for 30 min, interpolated for each biocide concentration. Log--log plots of these survival data and biocide concentration were constructed, and linear regression analysis performed in order to (i) calculate concentration exponents and (ii) compare the effectiveness of the biocides between variously aged biofilm and planktonic cells. From such analyses iso-effective concentrations of biocide (95% kill in 30 min) were calculated and expressed as planktonic : biofilm indices (PBI). CONCLUSION: PBI varied between 1.02 and 0.02, were relatively unaffected by age of the biofilms but differed significantly between organism and biocide. Notably those compounds with the higher activity against planktonic bacteria (PHMB and peracetic acid) were most prone to a biofilm effect but remained the most effective of the agents selected. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The endpoint method proved robust, enabled the bactericidal effects of the biocides to be assessed against in-situ biofilms, and was suitable for routine screening applications.
TI  - [Hospital infections and risk factors in the intensive care units of 16 Dutch hospitals, results of surveillance of quality assurance indicators].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the incidence of nosocomial infections and associated risk factors in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). DESIGN: Prospective. METHOD: From July 1997 to December 1999, standardised surveillance of nosocomial infections was implemented in ICUs in 16 hospitals in the Netherlands. Surveillance was performed in patients with an ICU stay of > or = 48 hrs; data were collected from admission until discharge from ICU. Data-collection included demographic data and patient- and treatment-related risk factors. The data were aggregated in a national database. RESULTS: In the research period, hospitals sent good quality data for aggregation in the national database on 2795 patients (61% male) and 27,922 ICU patient days. The median length of stay was six days, the median 'Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation' (APACHE) II score was 17 and the median age was 67 years. A total number of 749 infected patients were found with 1,177 nosocomial infections (27% of patients, 42 infections/1000 patient days), consisting of 43% pneumonia, 20% sepsis, 21% urinary tract infections, 16% other types of infections. Out of all the patients, 62% was on mechanical ventilation, 64% had a central venous line and 89% had a urinary catheter in situ. Selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract was used for 12% of the patients, and systemic antibiotics for 68%. Micro-organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis in catheter-related bloodstream infections and Escherichia coli in patients with urinary tract infections. Large differences in device use and incidence of infections were observed between the ICUs. CONCLUSION: The aggregated data gave insight into the incidence of nosocomial infections and associated risk factors in ICUs. The data are meant as references to support decision- and policy-making in local infection control programs.
TI  - Minor cytotoxic and antibacterial compounds from the rhizomes of Amomum aculeatum.
AB  - A new cytotoxic 1,7-dioxa-dispiro[5.1.5.2]pentadeca-9,12-dien-11-one derivative,  aculeatin D, and a new alkenone, 5-hydroxy-hexacos-1-en-3-one, have been isolated as minor compounds from the rhizomes of Amomum aculeatum. Their structures have been determined mainly by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Aculeatin D showed high cytotoxicity against the KB and the L-6 cell line with IC(50) of 0.38 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Additionally, it revealed remarkable activity against two Plasmodium falciparum strains, as well as against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma cruzi. 5-Hydroxy-hexacos-1-en-3-one exhibited neither cytotoxic nor antiprotozoal activity, whereas antibacterial testing against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed moderate to strong activity for both compounds.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of positively charged surfaces on adhering Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The infection of biomaterials is determined by an interplay of adhesion and surface growth of the infecting organisms. In this study, the antimicrobial effects on adhering bacteria of a positively charged poly(methacrylate) surface (xi potential +12 mV) were compared with those of negatively charged poly(methyl methacrylate) (-12 mV) and a highly negatively charged poly(methacrylate) (-18 mV) surface. Initial adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH(2) 102, Escherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 to these surfaces was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber in phosphate-buffered saline. Adhering bacteria were allowed to multiply by perfusing the flow chamber with growth medium. All bacteria adhered most rapidly to the positively charged surface, but there was no subsequent surface growth of the Gram-negative strains. On the negatively charged surfaces, despite a slower initial adhesion, surface growth of the adhering bacteria was exponential for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that positively charged biomaterial surfaces exert an antimicrobial effect on adhering Gram-negative bacteria, but not on Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Study on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing neonatal infections: a  12 year study (1987-1998).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The method of Manual of Clinical Microbiology was used to identify bacteria. We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of bacterial agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility as empirical treatment for neonatal infections. Disk diffusion tests were also done for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: From January 1987 to December 1998, 2,244 bacterial strains were isolated in our neonatal ward. The first three predominant species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (23.9%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (19.9%) and Escherichia coli (12.6%) in group I (infections acquired outside of hospital). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 18%, 15.2% and 12.6% respectively in group II (nosocomial infections). The sensitivity rates of those antimicrobials that are seldom used for newborns were found to be higher, while the resistant rates of the commonly used antimicrobial drugs have increased significantly. The resistant rates of bacterial isolate from group II to antimicrobial agents including penicillin and ampicillin were significantly higher than those isolated from group I (p<0.05)The sensitivity rate was 82.2% (717/833) by using amikacin only, when combined with penicillin, rose to 89%(741/833). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria were mainly responsible for nosocomial infections of neonates in our hospital. Infections acquired outside the hospital were mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Nosocomial pathogens produced drug resistance easily. Combination of amikacin and penicillin can be recommended as the initial antibiotics for treatment of neonatal infections.
TI  - SdrG, a fibrinogen-binding bacterial adhesin of the microbial surface components  recognizing adhesive matrix molecules subfamily from Staphylococcus epidermidis, targets the thrombin cleavage site in the Bbeta chain.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen and is a major  cause of foreign body infections. We have characterized the ligand binding activity of SdrG, a fibrinogen-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules from S. epidermidis. Western ligand blot analysis showed that a recombinant form of the N-terminal A region of SdrG bound to the native Bbeta chain of fibrinogen (Fg) and to a recombinant form of the Bbeta chain expressed in Escherichia coli. By analyzing recombinant truncates and synthetic peptide mimetics of the Fg Bbeta chain, the binding site for SdrG was localized to residues 6-20 of this polypeptide. Recombinant SdrG bound to a synthetic 25-amino acid peptide (beta1-25) representing the N terminus of the Fg Bbeta chain with a KD of 1.4 x 10(-7) m as determined by fluorescence polarization experiments. This was similar to the apparent K(D) (0.9 x 10(-7) m) calculated from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay where SdrG bound immobilized Fg in a concentration-dependent manner. SdrG could recognize fibrinopeptide B (residues 1-14), but with a substantially lower affinity than that observed for SdrG binding to synthetic peptides beta1-25 and beta6-20. However, SdrG does not bind to thrombin-digested Fg. Thus, SdrG appears to target the thrombin cleavage site in the Fg Bbeta chain. In fact, SdrG was found to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting by interfering with fibrinopeptide B release.
TI  - [Primary study of bacterial adhesion of prosthetic valve materials].
AB  - The adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans to Dacron and pyrolite carbon was measured in vitro with plate counting. The experimental result showed: the bacterials used in the experiment have adhesion to prosthetic valve materials; the bacterials have stronger adhesion to Dacron than to Pyrolite carbon; the bacterial adhesive capacity is significantly different and is affected by mechanical and chemical nature of biomaterials; Staphylococcur aureus has the strongest adhesion to Dacron, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the strongest adhesion to pyrolite carbon in all bacterials.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Pseudopterogorgia species of the Indian ocean.
AB  - A new ceramide, (2S,3R,4E)-1,3-dihydroxy-2-[(hexadecanoyl)amino]-nonadeca-4-ene (1), cholest-5-en-3beta,7beta,19-triol (2), identified as its, peracetyl derivative (3), and batyl alcohol (4) were isolated from Pseudopterogorgia species. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Designing surfaces that kill bacteria on contact.
AB  - Poly(4-vinyl-N-alkylpyridinium bromide) was covalently attached to glass slides to create a surface that kills airborne bacteria on contact. The antibacterial properties were assessed by spraying aqueous suspensions of bacterial cells on the surface, followed by air drying and counting the number of cells remaining viable (i.e., capable of growing colonies). Amino glass slides were acylated with acryloyl chloride, copolymerized with 4-vinylpyridine, and N-alkylated with different alkyl bromides (from propyl to hexadecyl). The resultant surfaces, depending on the alkyl group, were able to kill up to 94 +/- 4% of Staphylococcus aureus cells sprayed on them. A surface alternatively created by attaching poly(4-vinylpyridine) to a glass slide and alkylating it with hexyl bromide killed 94 +/- 3% of the deposited S. aureus cells. On surfaces modified with N-hexylated poly(4-vinylpyridine), the numbers of viable cells of another Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as of the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, dropped more than 100-fold compared with the original amino glass. In contrast, the number of viable bacterial cells did not decline significantly after spraying on such common materials as ceramics, plastics, metals, and wood.
TI  - [Opportunistic microorganisms in urinary tract diseases].
AB  - The microflora of clinical material (urine, urethral discharge and smear, vaginal discharge and smear, feces in colonic dysbacteriosis) from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) in the Moscow Region was studied. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis have been found to be the most common agents isolated from the urine of UTI patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other staphylococcal species and enterococci account for a smaller proportion of infections. High- (E. coli and S. epidermidis) and moderate-priority pathogens are translocated into the urinary tract from the colonic biotope in dysbacteriosis. The causative agents of non-gonococcal urethritis are staphylococci (more commonly epidermal ones) in 50% of cases, those of pyelonephritis are staphylococci (predominantly E. coli) in more than 50% of cases. The etiological agents of female genital infections are staphylococci (mainly epidermal ones) in 40% of cases.
TI  - Detection and culture of Bartonella quintana, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter spp. from decontaminated human body lice.
AB  - As part of a survey for trench fever among homeless people in Marseilles, France, we attempted isolation of Bartonella quintana from body lice. A decontamination protocol of immersion in 70% ethanol with 0.2% iodine was devised and was tested with a laboratory colony of body lice. Lice which had been experimentally contaminated with either Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Acinetobacter spp. were successfully decontaminated, and this process did not prevent the culture of B. quintana from these lice. One hundred sixty-one lice obtained from homeless patients were studied by the protocol. B. quintana was isolated on axenic medium from 15 of 161 body lice and was detected in 41 of 161 lice by PCR. Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens were also isolated from body lice. The sensitivities of PCR and culture of B. quintana were 98 and 36%, respectively. These procedures may be useful for epidemiologic studies of trench fever and for the recovery of strains for characterization and comparison.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Heat-killed microorganisms induce PAI-1 expression in human peritoneal mesothelial cells: role of interleukin-1alpha.
AB  - Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HMCs) have a critical role in maintaining the intraperitoneal balance between fibrinolysis and coagulation by expressing the fibrinolytic enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), as well as a specific plasminogen activator inhibitor (type 1; PAI-1). During bacterial peritonitis, the balance between intraperitoneal generation and degradation of fibrin is disturbed. As a consequence, severe peritoneal damage occurs, which is one of the leading causes of patient dropout from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy. Cultured HMCs isolated from omental biopsy specimens were used to study the effect of heat-killed strains (2 x 10(8)/mL) of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli on the synthesis of tPA and PAI-1. Conditioned media were obtained by incubating cells with the different bacterial strains. tPA and PAI-1 antigen concentrations were measured in the cell supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each of the three heat-killed microorganisms induced a time-dependent increase in PAI-1 synthesis. After a 48-hour incubation period, the strongest effect was seen in the presence of S aureus (3.5-fold versus control), followed by S epidermidis (2.5-fold versus control) and E coli (1.5-fold versus control). Under the same conditions, tPA antigen levels did not change after exposure to S aureus or E coli, whereas the addition of S epidermidis resulted in enhanced tPA antigen production (2-fold versus control). The increase in PAI-1 synthesis in the presence of the heat-killed microorganisms was preceded by similar changes in interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) levels. Inhibiting the activity of IL-1alpha with a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced bacterial-induced PAI-1 production. Our results indicate that the fibrinolytic imbalance during bacterial peritonitis depends on the bacterial species. The increase in PAI-1 synthesis, not the decrease in the production of tPA, alters mesothelial fibrinolytic activity. Because the increase in PAI-1 expression is significantly quenched by blocking the activity of IL-1alpha, the mesothelial release of this cytokine is involved in bacterial-induced changes in the fibrinolytic system.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Optimization of the resistance of arterial allografts to infection: comparative study with synthetic prostheses.
AB  - Arterial allografts can be used for in situ treatment of prosthetic graft infection. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the resistance of allografts and synthetic prostheses to infection by five strains of bacteria and to study antibiotic treatments designed to reduce allograft infection. Fresh and cryopreserved allografts were compared with synthetic prostheses made of various biomaterials including PTFE, plain Dacron, gelatine-sealed Dacron, and gelatine-sealed, rifampicine-bonded Dacron. Allografts were used with or without treatment using an antibiotic containing gentamycine, lincomycine, and vancomycine. The bacterial strains tested were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, non-slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection was evaluated by counting the number of adherent bacteria on the allograft or synthetic material after rinsing and ultrasonication. Statistical analysis was achieved using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Results showed that allografts not treated with antibiotics were highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Antibiotic treatment decreased infection. Application of antibiotic after thawing cryopreserved allografts led to a significant decrease. None of the biomaterials tested provided sufficient protection against bacteria resistant to the antibiotics used.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - How quantitative is quantitative PCR with respect to cell counts?
AB  - Quantitative diagnostic PCR systems based upon rDNA targeted primer and probe combinations were developed for the detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Primers and probes were designed in silico using the ARB software package (TU Munich) in combination with Primer Design software of PE Applied Biosystems. Purified genomic DNA or bacterial cells of target and reference organisms were used for the evaluation of the PCR assays applying the TaqMan technique on an ABI PRISM TM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Sensitive, reliable and reproducible quantification of target rDNA could be achieved applying primer-probe combinations that mediate in vitro amplification of DNA fragments smaller than 100 base pairs. Large amounts of non target DNA (1 mg per sample) remarkably affected the quantification potential of the approach resulting in an underestimation of the amounts of target DNA. One of the principal goals was to use quantitative PCR to study the correlation of gene and cell numbers depending on the growth behavior of target organisms and to explore the potential to estimate cell numbers from target DNA quantification. A clear correlation of rDNA quantification and bacterial growth was observed, however, cell numbers cannot directly be estimated from quantitative PCR data, given that the cellular genome content varies with the growth phase of the organisms. In the case of Escherichia coli the cell numbers which could be assigned to a certain number of rDNA targets varied reasonably depending upon the growth phase of batch cultures.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - Predictors of acquiring a nosocomial bloodstream infection on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of acquiring a nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: This retrospective cohort consisted of 202 neonates treated with ECMO from 1989 to 1998 at the author' institution. Data collected included patient demographics, primary and secondary diagnoses, white blood cell counts, antibiotic usage, presence of central lines, operative procedures, and outcome. Surveillance blood cultures were drawn daily from the circuit using sterile technique to identify acquired pathogens. Statistical analyses included logistic regression, Cox proportional regression analysis, and discriminate analysis. RESULTS: There were 1,245 blood cultures drawn on 202 patients (6.2 cultures per patient), and a nosocomial BSI was identified in 7 patients (3.4%) during this 10-year span. These were infections that were neither present nor incubating on admission. Pre-ECMO diagnoses of patients who had a nosocomial BSI while on bypass included group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal sepsis (n = 2), herpes simplex viral sepsis (n = 1), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 2), persistent pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), and congenital heart disease (n = 1). The median time on ECMO before obtaining a positive culture was 390 hours. The infectious agents responsible for these BSIs included Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and Escherichia coli (n = 1). The major factor associated with acquiring a nosocomial BSI on ECMO was the duration of bypass (391 v 141 hours, P =.002). Additionally, patients in the BSI group were more likely to have had an arterial catheter in place (16 v 7 days, P =.009) and to have received more screening blood cultures (16 v 6 cultures, P < 001). White blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and immature/total (I/T) ratios were not useful in predicting a nosocomial BSI. Of the 31 patients who required ECMO for more than 10 days, 7 (23%) had a positive blood culture, and 5 of these 7 infants (71%) died (P =.03). CONCLUSIONS: The only predictor of acquiring a nosocomial BSI on ECMO was the duration of support for greater than 10 days. Because classical predictors of infection are unreliable while the patient is on ECMO, the authors suggest that obtaining daily surveillance blood cultures beginning on the tenth day should be performed with prolonged ECMO courses. The authors confirmed previous reports of the association between a prolonged ECMO course and a high mortality rate. However, the authors speculate that, in actuality, the primary diagnosis leads to the prolonged course of support and is the major factor in the infant' demise.
TI  - [Microflora of patients with purulent septic diseases in the Moscow region].
AB  - The microflora of clinical material (blood, wound discharge, abdominal exudate, pleural exudate, milk in mastitis, as well as feces in dysbiosis of the large intestine), obtained from patients with purulent septic diseases in the Moscow region was studied. The study revealed the change of microflora from surface biotopes to closed cavities of the body. Gram-positive cocci, primarily coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly epidermal, were shown to play the leading etiological role in the development of purulent septic diseases. The development of bacteriemia was found to be caused by the penetration of staphylococci from local pyoinflammatory foci (appearing in purulent mastitis, wounds, peritonitis, pleural empyema and pleuritis), as well as by the translocation of staphylococci and Escherichia coli from the large intestine in dysbiosis.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  - The available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. Nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. In this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. Bacterial counts were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. A total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. An increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of S. aureus. The largest average growth increase was obtained with E. coli. The largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with S. marcescens. Our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced by humen wet cerumen. In vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.
TI  - Cloning of the sodA gene from Corynebacterium melassecola and role of superoxide  dismutase in cellular viability.
AB  - The sodA gene encoding the Corynebacterium melassecola manganese-cofactored superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The gene is transcribed monocistronically; the predicted polypeptide is 200 amino acids long and associates in a homotetrameric, manganese-dependent form, able to complement an SOD-deficient E. coli mutant. A second open reading frame, coding for a putative 217-amino-acid protein with high homology to peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases from various origins, has been identified immediately upstream of sodA in the opposite transcription orientation. The sodA gene was inactivated by insertion of an integrative vector carrying a kanamycin resistance gene. The growth rate of the SOD-deficient integrant was only slightly affected in BHI rich medium as well as in BMCG chemically defined medium, but was strongly affected by the presence of the redox-cycling agent paraquat. The SOD deficiency had, on the other hand, a deleterious effect on viability as soon as the culture entered the stationary phase of growth in BHI medium. Surprisingly, SOD deficiency was able to rescue the dramatic loss of viability observed for the wild-type strain in BMCG synthetic medium when glucose was not the limiting growth factor.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil elastase prevents cathelicidin activation and impairs clearance of bacteria from wounds.
AB  - The host defense roles of neutrophil elastase in a porcine skin wound chamber model were explored. Analysis of wound fluid by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and bacterial overlay confirmed that the neutrophil-derived protegrins constituted the major stable antimicrobial polypeptide in the wound fluid. The application to the wound of 0.10 and 0.25 mM N-methoxysuccinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-valine (AAPV) chloromethyl ketone, a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI), blocked the proteolytic activation of protegrins and diminished the associated antimicrobial activity as detected by radial diffusion assay against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans or by bacterial gel overlay against S epidermidis and E coli. The application of the related cathepsin G inhibitor (CGI), benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-leucine-phenylalanine (ZGLF) chloromethyl ketone, had no effect. In wound chambers that received 10(6) colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of S epidermidis, the presence of NEI significantly decreased the 24-hour clearance of bacteria from the wound compared to wounds treated with CGI or solvent only. Neither inhibitor, at 0.10 or 0.25 mM concentration, affected leukocyte accumulation or degranulation in the wound chambers. The in vitro microbicidal decrement due to NEI was restored by an amount of the specific protegrin (PG-1), which was equivalent to the measured difference of protegrin between control and inhibited chambers. Administration of 1 microg/mL exogenous PG-1 4 hours after chamber preparation was sufficient to normalize in vivo antimicrobial activity. Although pharmacologic NEIs are promising candidates as anti-inflammatory drugs, they may impair host defense in part by inhibiting the activation of cathelicidins by neutrophil elastase.
TI  - Reducing (oxidative) stress: structure and mechanism.
AB  
TI  - Hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver.
AB  - Cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. In insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. From human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (Hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. Two predominant forms, Hepc20 and Hepc25, contained 20 and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cDNAs in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. The full cDNA by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mRNA size on Northern blots. The liver was the predominant site of mRNA expression. The encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. Hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus. Hepcidin may be a vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the fat body of insects.
TI  - Effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on polysaccharide intercellular adhesin expression in biofilm-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Biofilm production is an important step in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus epidermidis polymer-associated infections and depends on the expression of the icaADBC operon leading to the synthesis of a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin. A chromosomally encoded reporter gene fusion between the ica promoter and the beta-galactosidase gene lacZ from Escherichia coli was constructed and used to investigate the influence of both environmental factors and subinhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics on ica expression in S. epidermidis. It was shown that S. epidermidis biofilm formation is induced by external stress (i.e., high temperature and osmolarity). Subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and the semisynthetic streptogramin antibiotic quinupristin-dalfopristin were found to enhance ica expression 9- to 11-fold, whereas penicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, gentamicin, ofloxacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin had no effect on ica expression. A weak (i.e., 2.5-fold) induction of ica expression was observed for subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. The results were confirmed by Northern blot analyses of ica transcription and quantitative analyses of biofilm formation in a colorimetric assay.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - FemABX family members are novel nonribosomal peptidyltransferases and important pathogen-specific drug targets.
AB  - Pathogen-specific antibiotics kill the offending species without inviting the patient's flora to help develop a resistance mechanism. The current scarcity of pathogen-specific antibiotics reflects the rarity of essential genes that are also not widely represented in and conserved among species. The FemX enzyme that initiates the synthesis of the interchain peptide of the peptidoglycan in a subset of bacterial species was purified from Lactobacillus viridescens. Subsequently, the encoding femX gene was cloned and sequenced using reverse genetics. The femX gene is a member of the femAB family, a large family of genes previously implicated in interchain peptide synthesis but with unknown specific functions. Mutagenesis of the femX gene identified the members of the extended FemABX family as novel nonribosomal peptidyltransferases. Determinants of FemX complex substrate recognition and a strong stimulator of FemX activity were also identified. The FemABX family members are ideal candidates for pathogen-specific antibiotic development.
TI  - [Pacemaker lead endocarditis: analysis of 11 cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of infection of permanent pacemaker ranges from 0.13 to 19.9%. Our objective is to review our experience and to analyze the epidemiology and treatment of those diagnosed as having pacemaker lead endocarditis. METHODS: A retrospective study include all cases diagnosis of pacemaker endocarditis in our hospital, since 1991 to 1998. Eleven patients with pacemaker endocarditis were included. RESULTS: Eleven patients were admitted for endocarditis related to pacemaker-lead infection. Fever occurred in nine patients (81.8%). A germ was isolated in nine patients (81.8%) and was a Staphylococcus in eight (88.9%). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated vegetations in only two patients (18.2%), whereas transesophageal echocardiography disclosed abnormal appearances on the pacemaker lead in eleven patients (100%). Six patients were treated with antibiotics initially and four patients required the removal of the whole infected material after finishing treatment with antibiotic. Five patients were treated since the beginning with a electrode removal who responded favorably. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of endocarditis related to pacemaker infection should be suspected in the presence of fever and patient with pacemaker. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed to look for vegetations. S. aureus and S. epidermidis are involved in the majority of these infections. The best treatment is an immediate removal of the entire pacing system and antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Arthroscopic management of septic arthritis: stages of infection and results.
AB  - Seventy-six patients with septic arthritis (78 affected joints) were treated with a combination of arthroscopic irrigation, debridement, and antibiotic therapy according to the tested bacterial sensitivity. There were 62 knee, 10 shoulder, 5 ankle joints, and 1 hip joint. No antibiotics were added to the irrigating solution. The arthroscopic and radiological stage of infection, treatment, and outcome in these patients was analyzed. The patients were classified into three groups according to initial stage of joint infection (stage I: 21 patients, 22 joints; stage II: 43 patients, 44 joints; stage III: 12 patients, 12 joints). Causes of infection were: hematogenous dissemination in 54%, postoperative wound infection in 28% (17% after open, 11% after arthroscopic procedures). Other causes were: 10% intra-articular steroid injections, 3% diagnostic punctures, and 3% open traumatic injury of the joint. In 78% of the infected joints the causative organism could be identified: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism found (42%), followed by streptococci (15%), pneumococci (6%), Escherichia coli (4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3%), Borrelia burgdorferi (3%), and others in 5%. In the stage I group only one patient needed repeated arthroscopic irrigation, in the stage II group 52%, and in the stage III group 75%. Open revision for eradication of the infection was necessary in one joint with stage II and in two joints with stage III infection (3%). Two joints of the stage III group needed additional surgery after successful treatment of the infection. The combination of arthroscopic irrigation and systemic antibiotic therapy was able to cure 91% of the affected joints. Open revision was necessary in 4% of joints. The number of arthroscopic procedures and the efficacy of treatment depended on the initial stage of the infection. It is concluded that an arthroscopic staging of the initial joint infection has prognostic and therapeutic consequences.
TI  - Analysis of microbiological trends in peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis from 1991 to 1998.
AB  - The microbial cause of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis is an important determinant of clinical outcome and the basis of widely used treatment guidelines. Five hundred forty-six cases of peritonitis in 374 patients from 1991 to 1998 were analyzed. The rate of peritonitis declined significantly from 1.37 episodes/patient-year in 1991 to 0.55 episode/patient-year in 1998 (P = 0.02). The rate of Gram-positive peritonitis decreased significantly from 0.75 to 0.28 episode/patient-year during the same period (P = 0.02). Conversely, the occurrence of Gram-negative peritonitis remained constant at approximately 0.16 episode/patient-year (P = 0.28). Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common causes of peritonitis, isolated in 27.8% and 19.3% of the culture-positive cases, respectively. A distinct decrease in peritonitis caused by S epidermidis was observed, with 0.40 episode/patient-year in 1991 compared with 0.11 to 0.20 episode/patient-year during subsequent years. The rate of infections caused by S aureus decreased significantly over time from a high of 0.21 episode/patient-year in 1992 to a low of 0.04 episode/patient-year in 1998 (P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and KLEBSIELLA: species were the most common causes of Gram-negative peritonitis, identified in 7.1%, 6.8%, and 5.2% of culture-positive cases, respectively. The most dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance was seen among S epidermidis. From 1991 and 1992 to 1997 and 1998, resistance to ciprofloxacin increased from 5.4% to 47.8% (P = 0.003), and resistance to methicillin increased from 18.9% to 73.9% (P = 0.03). Our study showed significant trends in the causative pathogens of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and dramatic increases in antibiotic resistance. These data support further study and warrant reevaluation of current treatment practices.
TI  - Ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  - Development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. The normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. Within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. Horizontal spread of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. An ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.

TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Activity of cecropin P1 and FA-LL-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  - Two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, FA-LL-37 and cecropin P1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five Lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. Both peptides inhibited Escherichia coli at 25 microM (FA-LL-39), and 1.56 microM (cecropin P1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microM, and 25 microM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microM, and 1.56 microM), but not Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. FA-LL-37 acted bacteriocidally against E. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two Gram-negative organisms. Cecropin P1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. Lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate Lactobacillus fermentum B-54, which was susceptible to FA-LL-37 at 100 microM. The differential activities of these peptides toward Gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. In addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
TI  - Cytotoxic cardenolides and antibacterial terpenoids from Crossopetalum gaumeri.
AB  - From the methanol extract of the roots of (Crossopetalum gaumeri, four new highly cytotoxic cardenolides, securigenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (2), 19-hydroxy-sarmentogenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (4), sarmentogenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxy alloside] (5), and securigenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxyal loside] (6) were isolated. The dichloromethane extract afforded the new diterpene 3,15-dihydroxy-18-norabieta-3,8,11,13-tetraene (7) as well as the new triterpene 2,3,7-trihydroxy-6-oxo-1,3,5(10),7-tetraene-24-nor-friedelane-29-o ic acid methylester (11). The new terpenoids lack cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity is moderate to low.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - The serine-aspartate repeat (Sdr) protein family in Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis can express three different cell-surface-associated proteins, designated SdrF, SdrG and SdrH, that contain serine-aspartate dipeptide repeats. Proteins SdrF and SdrG are similar in sequence and structural organization to the Sdr proteins of Staphylococcus aureus and comprise unique 625- and 548-residue A regions at their N termini, respectively, followed by 110-119-residue B-repeat regions and SD-repeat regions. The C termini contain LPXTG motifs and hydrophobic amino acid segments characteristic of surface proteins covalently anchored to peptidoglycan. In contrast, SdrH has a short 60-residue A region at its N terminus followed by a SD-repeat region, a unique 277-residue C region and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment. SdrH lacks a LPXTG motif. Recombinant proteins representing the A regions of SdrF, SdrG and SdrH were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Antisera specific to these proteins were raised in rabbits and used to identify Sdr proteins expressed by S. epidermidis. Only SdrF was released from lysostaphin-generated protoplasts of cells grown to late-exponential phase. SdrG and SdrH remained associated with the protoplast fraction and thus appear to be ineffectively sorted along the conventional pathway used for cell-wall-anchored proteins. In Southern hybridization analyses, the sdrG and sdrH genes were present in all 16 strains tested, whilst sdrF was present in 12 strains. Antisera from 16 patients who had recovered from S. epidermidis infections contained antibodies that reacted with recombinant A regions of SdrG and SdrH, suggesting that these proteins can be expressed during infection.
TI  - Effect of radiographic contrast agents on leukocyte metabolic response.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of radiographic contrast media in the setting of possible bowel ischemia and potential perforation is known to carry a risk of morbidity and mortality. However, studies of the effect of available contrast media on host immunological defense mechanisms are lacking. We have examined the effect of barium and of two water-soluble contrast agents of differing iodine concentration and osmolality, Conray 30 and Cysto Conray II, on leukocyte phagocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were incubated with the contrast media alone (termed the "resting state"), and in combination with a standard phagocytic challenge (Zymosan polysaccharide extract) and with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, to determine the effect of contrast media upon leukocyte phagocytic response. Incubation with saline was used as control. In the case of barium, the "resting state" and standard challenge experiments were repeated at nine dilutions, ranging from 1:1 to 1:1000. The leukocyte phagocytic response was measured in two ways: CO2 generation (an index of metabolic activity) and chemiluminescence (an index of generation of reactive oxygen species and bacterial killing). RESULTS: Barium, at clinical dilutions, causes a significant increase of baseline "resting state" phagocytic activity, which in turn leads to significant blunting of subsequent response to phagocytic challenge and adversely affects the response to all bacteria tested. There is no baseline activation of leukocytes by the water-soluble media, although there was some inhibition (rather than activation) of leukocyte metabolic activity. The effect of the water-soluble media on bacteria was more complex (although inhibition is minor compared to barium). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that barium is a significant activator of phagocytic cells, which results in deactivation of phagocytic response when challenged; these data serve to explain the enhanced adverse effect of barium in cases of fecal peritonitis.
TI  - Evolution of microbial pathogens.
AB  - Various genetic mechanisms including point mutations, genetic rearrangements and  lateral gene transfer processes contribute to the evolution of microbes. Long-term processes leading to the development of new species or subspecies are termed macroevolution, and short-term developments, which occur during days or weeks, are considered as microevolution. Both processes, macro- and microevolution need horizontal gene transfer, which is particularly important for the development of pathogenic microorganisms. Plasmids, bacteriophages and so-called pathogenicity islands (PAIs) play a crucial role in the evolution of pathogens. During microevolution, genome variability of pathogenic microbes leads to new phenotypes, which play an important role in the acute development of an infectious disease. Infections due to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli will be described with special emphasis on processes of microevolution. In contrast, the development of PAIs is a process involved in macroevolution. PAIs are especially important in processes leading to new pathotypes or even species. In this review, particular attention will be given to the fact that the evolution of pathogenic microbes can be considered as a specific example for microbial evolution in general.
TI  - [Analysis of bacterial flora in the uterine cervix in women during preterm labor].
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate type and frequency the bacterial flora of uterine cervix of female in case of preterm labor. There were analyzed 153 uterine cervix swabs of women before 37 weeks of pregnancy. It has been shown that the main etiologic factors of infestations were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Positive results of bacterial investigation has been occurred more frequently in multiparas with precocious ammonirrhea.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  - Plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. Antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from Finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. The tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. The most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) against Candida albicans, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.), willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium L.), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) against bacteria, and white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum. L.) against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Monitoring of two intravenous immunoglobulin. Preparations for immunoglobulin G subclasses and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens and relation with their levels in treated immunodeficient patients.
AB  - Patients with antibody deficiency disorders are highly susceptible to bacterial infections. Replacement therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) has been established in such patients for two decades. The efficacy of IVIG treatment depends on the amount of functional pathogen-specific antibodies provided. The present study was undertaken to determine the levels of immunoglobulin classes, IgG subclasses, and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens in two different IVIG preparations (Sandoglobulin and Gamimmune) and blood sera of IVIG-treated immunodeficient patients. The levels of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgG subclasses were determined in both IVIG preparations and in patients' sera and were compared with those of healthy individuals. Sandoglobulin contained significantly higher concentrations of IgA, IgG, and IgG4 than Gamimmune. The latter contained higher concentrations of IgG1. Patients treated with Gamimmune) had significantly lower concentration of IgG4 as compared with healthy individuals and Sandoglobulin-treated patients. This finding was related to the preparation's composition. Screening of 20 lots from each preparation for antibodies to frequent clinically isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococci spp. showed a high lot-to-lot variability. In order to overcome the lot-to-lot variability and correlate the observed effects with each IVIG preparation, the administered IVIG lots were selected so that their titers were in the interval of mean value +/- S.D. for each pathogen. The two tested preparations showed significant differences in their content of specific antibodies that ultimately affected the levels of these antibodies in treated patients. More specifically, Sandoglobulin contained higher levels of antibodies to E. coli and S. epidermidis strains. Infusion of this preparation maintained the respective antibodies in the recipients significantly higher than those of healthy individuals. Gamimmune infusion led to similar and comparable levels. Both IVIG preparations had comparable antibody titers towards K. pneumoniae, provided high amounts of antibodies, and kept recipients' specific IgG at levels significantly higher than those of the healthy individuals. Enterococci spp. specific antibodies were significantly higher in Gamimmune, whereas titers of antibodies towards S. aureus were comparable. Levels of antibodies against both Enterococci spp. and S. epidermidis after administration of both preparations were close to those in healthy individuals. None of the patients developed infection during the time of the study. In conclusion, most of the lots of the two IVIG preparations studied, despite some quantitative differences, provide patients with sufficient amounts of antibodies to bacterial surface antigens that protect them against infections.
TI  - Activation of antibacterial prodrugs by peptide deformylase.
AB  - 5'-Dipeptidyl derivatives of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU) (1a-d) were synthesized.  These compounds are biologically inactive but can be activated by peptide deformylase, which removes the N-terminal formyl group of the dipeptide, to release the active drug FdU via an intramolecular cyclization reaction. Because the deformylase is ubiquitous among bacteria but absent in mammalian cells, 1a-d provide a novel class of potential antibacterial agents.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (SB-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of Gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis) and Gram-positive wound infection resulting from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. Oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. Around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. In the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (P < 0.01) compared with no treatment. No comparator agent had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. Notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (P < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against E. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were inferior (P < 0.01) against P. mirabilis infection. In the S. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01). Results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (P > 0.05). Gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (P < 0.01). No comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against S. pyogenes or S. aureus infections. These data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of Gram-negative urinary tract infection and Gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Triterpene saponins from the fruits of Hedera helix.
AB  - Six triterpene saponins, including two new compounds, were isolated from the fruits of Hedera helix L. (Araliaceae). The structures of the new compounds, named helixosides A and B, were established as 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl hederagenin 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, respectively, on the basis of chemical and spectral data.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - PCR-RFLP-mediated detection and speciation of bacterial species causing endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in the identification and speciation of bacteria causing endophthalmitis. METHODS: PCR-RFLP was performed on 53 strains of 14 bacterial species (eight Gram positive and five Gram negative) collected from both keratitis and endophthalmitis patients. Two pairs of oligonucleotide primers based on the 16S rDNA gene were used to PCR-amplify 1.2- and 1.0-kb fragments of bacterial genomic DNA. RFLPs within the PCR product were used to speciate the organisms. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the nested PCR amplification reaction was one organism. All bacteria tested could be identified and speciated using RFLP analysis except for Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, which could not be interdifferentiated using RFLP. Molecular analysis of two vitreous samples from two eyes with typical signs of bacterial endophthalmitis confirmed the presence of E. coli in the vitreous from a culture-positive case with E. coli endophthalmitis and revealed the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the vitreous of a culture-negative case. CONCLUSIONS: It is expected that this technique will provide a useful laboratory tool for future microbiologic diagnosis of patients presenting with endophthalmitis, especially for those eyes that prove culture negative.
TI  - Evaluation of biohazards in dehydrated biofilms on foodstuff packaging.
AB  - Plastic materials used for food packaging are clean but not sterile when the food is just packaged. Accidental wet contamination may occur at every moment between packaging and opening by the consumer: on polyethylene (PET), bacteria may adhere strongly and constitute a biofilm in less than 24 h. By rolling on themselves, PET sheets may contaminate food. We tried to show that contact with salted foodstuffs favoured microbial recovery. Four strains were chosen to perform biofilms on PET: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Biofilms were dried up 24 h. Biofilm bacteria were stressed by adhesion, by starvation and by dehydration. However, they were capable of recovery in salted solutions or media, probably because one (or more) stress protected them against another stress. Stress was demonstrated by stress protein production, by mean of electrophoresis, and membrane lesions by mean of flow cytometry. Stress recovery was performed in aqueous salted solutions or salted brain-heart infusion with NaCl 9, 15, 20 and 30 g/l. Staphylococci were more sensitive to these stresses and recovery was a function of salt concentration. Gram-negative bacteria were little affected by stresses; salt effects were less important. If all these biofilms were capable of recovery from stresses in salted media, flexible PET could possibly lead to a health hazard when it is used for wet salt meats, e.g.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and non-conventional antibiotics on bacteria.
AB  - The individual activity of antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin in combination with compounds known to modify bacterial resistance to given antibiotics was studied using the checkerboard method. The combination of promethazine with either ampicillin, tetracycline or erythromycin or the combination of methylene blue and erythromycin produced significant synergistic activity against Escherichia coli. Verapamil, however, in combination with ampicillin reduced the activity of ampicillin against E. coli. Combinations of clomipramine with either tetracycline or erythromycin, promethazine and erythromycin or verapamil and ampicillin were synergistic against Staphylococcus epidermidis that was resistant to these antibiotics. The only synergy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown by the combination of methylene blue and gentamicin.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of peptide deformylase inhibitors.
AB  - Peptide deformylase catalyzes the removal of the N-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized polypeptides in eubacteria. Its essential character in bacterial cells makes it an attractive target for antibacterial drug design. In this work, we have rationally designed and synthesized a series of peptide thiols that act as potent, reversible inhibitors of purified recombinant peptide deformylase from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The most potent inhibitor has a K(I) value of 11 nM toward the B. subtilis enzyme. These inhibitors showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as low as 5 microM ( approximately 2 microg/mL). The PDF inhibitors induce bacterial cell lysis and are bactericidal toward all four bacterial strains that have been tested, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli. Resistance evaluation of one of the inhibitors (1b) against B. subtilis showed that no resistant clone could be found from >1 x 10(9) cells. Quantitative analysis using a set of inhibitors designed to possess varying potencies against the deformylase enzyme revealed a linear correlation between the MIC values and the K(I) values. These results suggest that peptide deformylase is the likely molecular target responsible for the antibacterial activity of these inhibitors and is therefore a viable target for antibacterial drug design.
TI  - Antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  - In spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. The choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora, available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. The most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes Bacteroides fragilis group prevails. Adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. Semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For the treatment of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. Combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. In recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. Among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. Indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. This combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.
TI  - Safety and cleaning of medical materials and devices.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate different procedures to safely remove microorganisms, protein, and mammalian cells from materials and provide a suitable method for cleaning and assessing effectiveness of cleaning medical devices for reuse or for analysis of failure. Safety considerations for the personnel performing the cleaning or handling the device after cleaning are important issues. Polystyrene plates (96 well) were used to simulate device surfaces not amenable to manual scrubbing. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oral flora were grown in the plates. The plates were stained with crystal violet and the optical densities recorded. The results indicated that E. coli did not adhere well and Pseudomonas formed clumps that were easily detached from the surface of the plates. However, S. epi, C. albicans, and the oral organisms formed adherent biofilms that were difficult to remove from the plates. Detergents with enzymes and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) bleach were both effective in removing the biofilm. Other detergents and surfactants were not effective. The aldehyde agents did not remove the organisms and made further cleaning difficult. Allowing the biofilm to dry first made cleaning very difficult. Only the NaOCl bleach could subsequently remove the dried or aldehyde fixed organisms from the wells. The same 96-well polystyrene plate format was used to measure the amount of protein and cell adherence as well as the effectiveness of subsequent cleaning. Bradford reagent was used to detect protein as a measure of the cleaning efficacy. As with the bacteria, NaOCl bleach was effective at removing the protein and cells that had been dried or fixed by formalin or alcohol, whereas detergent with enzymes was not very effective. This study confirmed that used medical devices, contaminated with microorganisms, protein, and/or mammalian cells, should not be allowed to dry before cleaning and that a thorough cleaning procedure should precede sterilization or disinfection (with the exception of NaOCl bleach which also cleans).
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Epidemiology and microbiology of surgical wound infections.
AB  - This study included 676 surgery patients with signs and symptoms indicative of wound infections, who presented over the course of 6 years. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 614 individuals. A single etiologic agent was identified in 271 patients, multiple agents were found in 343, and no agent was identified in 62. A high preponderance of aerobic bacteria was observed. Among the common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (191 patients, 28.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170 patients, 25.2%), Escherichia coli (53 patients, 7.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (48 patients, 7.1%), and Enterococcus faecalis (38 patients, 5.6%).
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - A bone sialoprotein-binding protein from Staphylococcus aureus: a member of the staphylococcal Sdr family.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, isolated from bone and joint infections, specifically interact with bone sialoprotein (BSP), a glycoprotein of bone and dentine extracellular matrix, via a cell-surface protein of M(r) 97000 [Yacoub, Lindahl, Rubin, Wendel, Heinegard and Ryden, (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 222, 919-925]. Amino acid sequences of seven trypsin fragments from the 97000-M(r) BSP-binding protein were determined. A gene encoding a protein encompassing all seven peptide sequences was identified from chromosomal DNA isolated from S. aureus strain O24. This gene encodes a protein with 1171 amino acids, called BSP-binding protein (Bbp), which displays similarity to recently described proteins of the Sdr family from S. aureus. SdrC, SdrD and SdrE encode putative cell-surface proteins with no described ligand specificity. Bbp also shows similarity to a fibrinogen-binding protein from S. epidermidis called Fbe. A serine-aspartic acid repeat sequence was found close to the cell-wall-anchoring Leu-Pro-Xaa-Thr-Gly sequence in the C-terminal end of the protein. Escherichia coli cells were transformed with an expression vector containing a major part of the bbp gene fused to the gene for glutathione S-transferase. The affinity-purified fusion protein bound radiolabelled native BSP, and inhibited the binding of radiolabelled BSP to staphylococcal cells. Serum from patients suffering from bone and joint infection contained antibodies that reacted with the fusion protein of the BSP-binding protein, indicating that the protein is expressed during an infection and is immunogenic. The S. aureus Bbp protein may be important in the localization of bacteria to bone tissue, and thus might be of relevance in the pathogenicity of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial action of the essential oils of Salvia desoleana and S. sclarea.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils of Salvia desoleana Atzei & Picci  and Salvia sclarea L. from Sardinia (Italy) was analysed by GC and GC/MS. S. desoleana oil had a high content of monoterpenic esters (linalyl acetate and alpha-terpinyl acetate) and a lower amount of the corresponding alcohols while S. sclarea oil was characterised by a higher content of alcohols and lower quantity of esters. We studied the antimicrobial activity of these oils concerning their use in pharmaceutical preparations for local application. Only weak microbiostatic inhibitory activity was seen against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and C. albicans, but since inhibition increased progressively with contact time, better results could be obtained by using these oils in bioadhesive formulations that would also have anti-inflammatory and peripheral analgesic action at a local level, as demonstrated in experimental animals following systemic application.
TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas. In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.
TI  - Antibacterial steroid alkaloids from the stem bark of Holarrhena pubescens.
AB  - Holarrhena pubescens (syn. H. antidysenterica) (L.) WALL. stem bark was tested for antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the microdilution broth method as well as the disc diffusion method. The crude methanolic extract was active against all tested bacteria. Further chemical fractionation indicated that the antibacterial activity was mainly associated with the alkaloids. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for the crude extract, the total alkaloids and the neutral fraction using microdilution broth method. The results were compared with reference antibiotics. The total alkaloids showed remarkable activity against S. aureus (MIC = 95 microg/ml).
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide for prevention of bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use of potent antibiotics, infections of artificial implants and catheters are of increasing concern. We tested whether local treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), long known as an inexpensive wound disinfectant, could prevent or reduce bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials. METHODS: Two-centimeter-long pieces of polyurethane and silicone tubing were contaminated with a standardized solution of Staphylococcus epidermidis (10(5)/mL) and then rinsed and wiped with saline (0.9%) solution. Bacterial growth was assessed after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Bacterial colonies were compared for the following treatments: wiping only with saline; wiping with 1.5%, 2%, or 3% H2O2; pretreating biomaterials with 3% H2O2 and subsequent contamination for 2 and 4 hours without treatment after contamination; and contamination of tubings 1 month after pretreatment with 3% H2O2. The effect of 3% H2O2 was also assessed on contamination with Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was reduced by more than 99% when the contaminated tubes were treated with 3% H2O2 compared with saline control (p < 0.001). Lower concentrations of H2O2 were less effective. The length of the contamination period had no influence on the effectiveness of H2O2 when used on polyurethane but did with silicone tubings. Pretreatment with H2O2 1 month before contamination still reduced bacterial growth rate by 90% on polyurethane and by 75% on silicone tubings. Comparable effects on bacterial growth rate were observed for staphylococci (-90%, p < 0.001) and escherichiae (-90%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Local treatment with 3% H2O2 significantly reduced bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials even for 1 month after treatment. This finding might influence clinical strategies of prevention of foreign body infection.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.

TI  - Ciprofloxacin in treatment of nosocomial meningitis in neonates and in infants: report of 12 cases and review.
AB  - Twelve cases of neonatal and infant nosocomial meningitis treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin in doses of 10 to 60 mg/kg/day are described. Four neonates were 21 to 28 days old and eight infants were 2 to 6 months old. Six presented with Gram-negative meningitis: Escherichia coli (2), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1), two with two organisms, and (H. influenzae plus Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter spp. plus S. epidermidis), and six were attributable to Gram-positive cocci (four S. aureus and two Enterococcus faecalis). Ten cases were cured. In two cases, reversible hydrocephalus appeared that responded to intraventricular punctures. In seven children, no neurologic sequellae appeared after a 2- to 4-year follow-up. One neonate had relapse of meningitis 3 months later and was ultimately cured, but developed a sequellae of psychomotoric retardation. Follow-up varied from 27 months to 10 years. Current published case reports from Medline on quinolone use in meningitis in neonates and infants are reviewed.
TI  - The effect of water, ascorbic acid, and cranberry derived supplementation on human urine and uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber.
AB  - In this study, urine was collected from groups of volunteers following the consumption of water, ascorbic acid, or cranberry supplements. Only ascorbic acid intake consistently produced acidic urine. Photospectroscopy data indicated that increased water consumption produced urine with lower protein content. Surface tension measurements of the collected urine showed that both water and cranberry supplementation consistently produced urine with surface tensions higher than the control or urine collected following ascorbic acid intake. These urine samples were also employed to study uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. Urine obtained after ascorbic acid or cranberry supplementation reduced the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Candida albicans. Conversely, urine obtained from subjects with increased water intake vastly increased the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent E. coli and E. faecalis (P < 0.05).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Feglymycin, a novel inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus. Fermentation, isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  - The novel peptide feglymycin has been isolated from cultures of Streptomyces sp.  DSM 11171 by solid phase extraction, size exclusion chromatography and repeated reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular weight was found to be 1900.90 g/mol and the molecular formula is C95H97Nl3O30. Feglymycin contains 13 amino acids of which four are 3-hydroxyphenylglycine and five are 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues. The structure of the linear peptide has been determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The sequence was confirmed by the observed mass spectroscopic fragmentation pattern. As well as having weak antibacterial activity, feglymycin inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro.
TI  - Cell surface analysis techniques: What do cell preparation protocols do to cell surface properties?
AB  - Cell surface analysis often requires manipulation of cells prior to examination.  The most commonly employed procedures are centrifugation at different speeds, changes of media during washing or final resuspension, desiccation (either air drying for contact angle measurements or freeze-drying for sensitive spectroscopic analysis, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and contact with hydrocarbon (hydrophobicity assays). The effects of these procedures on electrophoretic mobility, adhesion to solid substrata, affinity to a number of Sepharose columns, structural integrity, and cell viability were systematically investigated for a range of model organisms, including carbon- and nitrogen-limited Psychrobacter sp. strain SW8 (glycocalyx-bearing cells), Escherichia coli (gram-negative cells without a glycocalyx), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (gram-positive cells without a glycocalyx). All of the cell manipulation procedures severely modified the physicochemical properties of cells, but with each procedure some organisms were more susceptible than others. Considerable disruption of cell surfaces occurred when organisms were placed in contact with a hydrocarbon (hexadecane). The majority of cells became nonculturable after air drying and freeze-drying. Centrifugation at a high speed (15,000 x g) modified many cell surface parameters significantly, although cell viability was considerably affected only in E. coli. The type of washing or resuspension medium had a strong influence on the values of cell surface parameters, particularly when high-salt solutions were compared with low-salt buffers. The values for parameters obtained with different methods that allegedly measure similar cell surface properties did not correlate for most cells. These results demonstrate that the methods used to prepare cells for cell surface analysis need to be critically investigated for each microorganism so that the final results obtained reflect the nature of the in situ microbial cell surface as closely as possible. There is an urgent need for new, reliable, nondestructive, minimally manipulative cell surface analysis techniques that can be used in situ.
TI  - C-reactive protein (CRP) response patterns in neonatal septicaemia.
AB  - C-reactive protein (CRP) is an unreliable diagnostic tool in the early diagnosis  of neonatal septicaemia. However, serial measurements have been shown to be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a specific CRP response pattern to different groups of pathogens could be identified during treatment of neonatal septicaemia. Serial CRP measurements from day 1 to 4 in monomicrobial blood culture-proven episodes of septicaemia were reviewed. In 4416 admissions, 180 out of 206 positive blood cultures were monomicrobial; 121 monomicrobial septic episodes were eligible for final analysis of the CRP response during treatment. A low median (M) value (day 1 to 4) was identified in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (M=23 mg/l), contrasting with high median values in Staphylococcus aureus (M=58 mg/l), group B streptococci (M=51 mg/l), Escherichia coli (M=51 mg/l) and Candida species (M=76 mg/l) (p<0.001). Median CRP values in the two groups were different for each of the treatment days 1 to 4 (p<0.001). An increase (p<0.001) in CRP during the 24 h before initiation of treatment was a sign of late-onset CONS septicaemia. In episodes where antimicrobial treatment failed, CRP levels were moderately elevated the day prior to treatment start and increased continuously thereafter, whereas successful treatment was generally accompanied by a decline in CRP in less than 4 days. The CRP response to CONS is significantly less pronounced than to other commonly encountered pathogens in neonatal septicaemia. A rise in CRP beyond the third day of empirical treatment should give rise to a suspicion of fungal infection or ineffective antibacterial treatment.
TI  - Prolonged leaching time of peptide antibiotics from acrylic bone cement.
AB  - The leaching time of antibiotics in growth inhibitory concentrations from polyacrylic bone cements was determined using Escherichia coli, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target bacteria. The leaching time of the peptide antibiotics vancomycin and polymyxin B nonapeptide was considerably longer than that of gentamicin, novobiocin, and erythromycin. Among the nonpeptide antibiotics, the leaching time of novobiocin lasted longer than did that of gentamicin. The acylated parent polymyxin B antibiotic leached for a considerably shorter period than did the deacylated polymyxin B nonapeptide derivative, suggesting that the lipids impede the leaching process from the cement. Cement beads impregnated with polymyxin B nonapeptide and introduced into the tibia of three rabbits receiving oral novobiocin protected bone infection against a challenge of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that otherwise caused infection in tibias containing gentamicin impregnated cement beads. The peptide antibiotics alone or in combination with other antibiotics (polymyxin B nonapeptide and novobiocin) impregnated in cements for orthopaedic procedures may provide longer periods of protection against a wide range of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Screening of medicinal plants from Trinidad and Tobago for antimicrobial and insecticidal properties.
AB  - Antibacterial activity in 51 extracts from 29 plant species currently used in traditional medicine in Trinidad and the neighbouring Caribbean islands was tested for by the agar dilution streak method using six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salmonella tophimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extracts from eight of the plants tested showed significant activity against one or more micro-organisms and the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus. In the bioassays for toxicity towards the Aedes aegypti mosquito the most effective plant extracts were from Justicia pectoralis, Manihot utilissima and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis.
TI  - [Epidemiological analysis of congenital infections in newborns].
AB  - The aim of this study was to review 2567 deliveries in the District Hospital in Bialystok in 1997. In 2388 term labours and 179 preterm ones we noticed the congenital infections; in 90 (3.8%) and in 58 (32.4%) newborns respectively. The main etiologic factors of infections were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis in term newborns and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli in preterm babies. Clinical signs of the urinary tract infection were most frequent in mature infants, whereas the sepsis was quite common in premature newborns.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT antimicrobial barrier dressing.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing (Westaim Biomedical Corp, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. The data indicate that ACTICOAT silver had the lowest MIC and MBC and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. Viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. Mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest MICs and MBCs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after 6 hours of treatment. The results suggest that ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. ACTICOAT dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. The study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a MIC or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent or dressing. A combination of tests is desirable.
TI  - Adherence of Staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  - A novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. A secreted protein, Eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of S. aureus Newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of S. aureus. Eap bound much less to cells of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, or Escherichia coli. The protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of S. aureus. Binding of S. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of Eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on CAPD: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  - Long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. TGF-beta1 and bFGF were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with CAPD and at 5 months. To determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. Serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. TGF-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (P<0.05). No change in bFGF was seen during this initial 5 months. TGF-beta1 was increased on the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (P<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). Basic FGF reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; P=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 is influenced by CAPD treatment per se, and together with bFGF is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - A novel extracellular diterpenoid with antibacterial activity from the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune.
AB  - A novel extracellular metabolite with an unprecedented diterpenoid skeleton, 8-[(5-carboxy-2-hydroxy)benzyl]-2-hydroxy-1,1,4a,7, 8-pentamethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,6,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-dodecahydrophenanthrene , has been isolated from the culture medium of the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune Vaucher (EAWAG 122b) by means of bioguided isolation. The molecule was designated as noscomin. The structure was determined by spectroscopic methods, mainly NMR and mass spectrometry. Noscomin exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  - Pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. As the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous metronidazole. Pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. The drug tolerance was good. No clinically significant adverse events were recorded.
TI  - Identification and characterization of SirA, an iron-regulated protein from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The acquisition of iron by pathogenic bacteria is often a crucial step in establishing infection. To accomplish this, many bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, produce low-molecular-weight iron-chelating siderophores. However, the secretion and transport of these molecules in gram-positive organisms are poorly understood. The sequence, organization, and regulation of genes involved in siderophore transport are conserved among gram-negative bacteria. We used this information to identify a putative siderophore transport locus from an S. aureus genomic sequence database. This locus contains three predicted open reading frames with a high degree of homology to genes involved in siderophore uptake in several bacterial species, in particular the cbr locus of the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi. The first gene in the locus, which we have designated sir for staphylococcal iron regulated, encodes a putative lipoprotein with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. The open reading frame is preceded by a 19-bp region of dyad symmetry with homology for operator sequences controlling iron-regulated expression of genes in other bacteria. Fur titration experiments indicate that this region of dyad symmetry is sufficient for Fur-dependent regulation in Escherichia coli. The expression of this gene was repressed, in a dose-dependent manner, by the addition of iron to the S. aureus culture medium. sir-encoded proteins may be involved in iron acquisition in vivo and therefore may be targets for antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Suitability of the Charm HVS and a microbiological multiplate system for detection of residues in raw milk at EU maximum residue levels.
AB  - In this paper we assessed the suitability of the Charm HVS and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (MRL). The multiplate system is composed of Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at pH 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, Bacillus cereus plate at pH 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, Micrococcus luteus plate at pH 8.0 for detection of macrolides, Bacillus subtilis BGA plate at pH 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with B. subtilis BGA at pH 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, Escherichia coli plate at pH 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and Staphylococcus epidermidis plate at pH 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. For each test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established EU MRLs of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. The Charm HVS test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near the EU MRLs. The multiplate system gave valid results. Based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Impact of either elevated or decreased levels of cytochrome bd expression on Shigella flexneri virulence.
AB  - Shigella spp. are the major cause of bacillary dysentery worldwide. The pathogenic process involves bacterial invasion and lysis of the phagocytic vacuole, followed by replication and movement within the cell cytoplasm and, ultimately, spread directly into adjacent cells. This study demonstrates that S. flexneri cytochrome bd expression is necessary for normal intracellular survival and virulence. Cytochrome bd is one of two terminal oxidases in the bacterial respiratory chain that reduce molecular oxygen to water, utilizing intermediates shuttled through the electron transport chain. S. flexneri mutants that contain a disruption in the cydC locus, which leads to defective cytochrome bd expression, or in the riboflavin (ribE) or ubiquinol-8 (ubiH) biosynthetic pathway, which leads to elevated cytochrome bd expression, were evaluated in intracellular survival and virulence assays. The cydC mutant formed significantly smaller plaques, had significantly decreased intracellular survival, and had a 100-fold increase in lethal dose for mice compared with the wild type. The ribE and ubiH mutants each formed significantly larger plaques and had a 10-fold decrease in lethal dose for mice compared with the wild type. The data indicate that expression of cytochrome bd is required for S. flexneri intracellular survival and virulence.
TI  - Interaction of the cyclic antimicrobial cationic peptide bactenecin with the outer and cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  - Bactenecin, a 12-amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils, has two cysteine residues, which form one disulfide bond, making it a cyclic molecule. To study the importance of the disulfide bond, a linear derivative Bac2S was made and the reduced form (linear bactenecin) was also included in this study. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that bactenecin existed as a type I beta-turn structure regardless of its environment, while the reduced form and linear bactenecin adopted different conformations according to the lipophilicity of the environment. Bactenecin was more active against the Gram-negative wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium than its linear derivative and reduced form, while all three peptides were equally active against the outer membrane barrier-defective mutants of the first two bacteria. Only the two linear peptides showed activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus facaelis. Bactenecin interacted well with the outer membrane and its higher affinity for E. coli UB1005 lipopolysaccharide and improved ability to permeabilize the outer membrane seemed to account for its better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The interaction of bactenecin with the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by its ability to dissipate the membrane potential by using the fluorescence probe 3, 3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine and an outer membrane barrier-defective mutant E. coli DC2. It was shown that the linear derivative and reduced form were able to dissipate the membrane potential at much lower concentrations than bactenecin despite the similar minimal inhibitory concentrations of all three against this barrier-defective mutant.
TI  - Microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. Because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. In addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (PTCD) were included. Sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. Bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary drainage. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. In the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. RESULTS: The incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. Twelve different microorganisms were detected, with Escherichia coli found in four cases. From 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. A single agent was detected in eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). The seven most frequently isolated germs were E. coli and Enterococcus (each n = 19), Klebsiella (n = 10), Streptococcus viridans (n = 9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Morganella morganii (n = 4), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. Examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of Candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). Interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), with a consequent rise in the gastric pH value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on PPIs (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). In-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. Imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. Enterococci, Klebsiella and Streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. In view of the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in puppies with canine parvovirus infection: a cohort study.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the possible association between canine parvoviral enteritis and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Forty-three puppies that were admitted to the outpatient service of the Animal Medical Clinic with clinical signs compatible with parvoviral enteritis formed the exposed group. The clinical diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a positive fecal ELISA test (CITE test: IDDEX Lab., Westbrook, ME). Twenty-three (53.5%) of these puppies were males and 20 (46.5%) were females. Their age ranged from 1.5 to 5.5 months. Forty-eight clinically normal and age-matched puppies, that had been admitted to the clinic for vaccinations and had a negative result in the aforementioned ELISA test, were randomly selected to form the unexposed group. Urine samples were collected by antebupic cystocentesis from all puppies and submitted for bacterial culture. In the parvovirus exposed group, 11 of 43 puppies had detectable bacteriuria. The isolates were Escherichia coli alone (8/11-72.7%) Staphylococcus aureus alone (1/11-9.1%) and mixed cultures of E. coli and S. epidermitis (2/11-18.2%). In the unexposed group there were three puppies with detectable bacteriuria, one isolate each of E. coli, Enterococcus durans and Corynebacterium spp. Puppies with parvoviral enteritis had five (95% CI: 1.3-19.8) times higher odds of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria than puppies without the disease. The observed increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria among puppies with parvoviral enteritis was probably due to the fecal contamination of the external genitalia and the neutropenia these puppies exhibited.
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - Postoperative hospital-acquired infection in Hungvuong Obstetric and Gynaecological Hospital, Vietnam.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted following 1364 major operations at the 450-bed  Hungvuong Obstetric and Gynaecological Hospital in HoChiMinh City, Vietnam, from 1 May to 30 September 1997 to characterize postoperative hospital-acquired infections. These infections were identified by ward rounds, review of laboratory results and patient follow-up until 30 days after discharge. During the study period, 194 infections were identified, yielding a rate of 14.2 infections per 100 operations. The most common sites were surgical wound and urinary tract, contributing together 95.9% of all hospital-acquired infections. The four most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (29.6%), Escherichia coli (20.4%), Enterococci (16.7%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.8%).
TI  - A plasmid that encodes three genes for resistance to macrolide antibiotics in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In previous letters, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 148 (1997) 91-96, it was demonstrated  that plasmid pMS97-obtained from a in 1971 clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus strain MS8968 resistant to macrolide (Mac) antibiotics--carried an msrA gene and uncharacterized erm gene, respectively. msrA encodes a cytoplasmic membrane protein that mediates the so-called 'active Mac-efflux' (designated hereafter as msrSA') and erm encodes a methyltransferase by which a specific adenine residue of 23S rRNA is modified: methylation prevents Mac antibiotics from binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, we found, in addition, an mph-like gene (hereafter referred to as mphBM) present together with msrSA' and erm on pMS97. By a BLASTP analysis, the gene mphBM product has 49% identity and 67% similarity to the amino acid sequence of MPH(2')II encoded by mphB from Escherichia coli. The order of genes was 5'-msrSA'-mphBM-3', with a 342-base-pair spacer sequence. Although we have not yet determined where erm gene is located on pMS97, the gene seems to be downstream from mphBM. This finding suggests a warning to us concerning the imprudent use of antibiotics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of preservative-free bupivacaine on microorganisms in the human skin flora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate at which the bactericidal activity of preservative-free bupivacaine develops at body temperature and at room temperature is not known. We studied the bactericidal activity of preservative-free bupivacaine on two strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), two strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. METHODS: The pathogen was exposed to 0.5% bupivacaine for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h at 37 degrees C and room temperature. In addition, each strain of MRSA, MSSA, and S. epidermidis was exposed to distilled water, and 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 0.75% bupivacaine at 37 degrees C. The inocula from the suspensions were cultured for 48 h at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The 1- through 24-h exposures of 4 strains of S. aureus to 0.5% bupivacaine at room temperature reduced the colony count by 21.7%, 34.7%, 51.1%, 65.6%, and 81.1%, respectively, and the exposure at 37 degrees C reduced the count by 34.1%, 50.8%, 66.3%, 94.5%, and 96.0%, respectively. The differences were significant at all exposure times (P < 0.001, respectively). No organisms grew in the strain of E. coli after 24-h exposure and in the strain of S. epidermidis after 12- and 24-h exposures at 37 degrees C. The percent change from controls in the strains of E. coli and S. epidermidis was significantly higher than that in the strains of S. aureus at all exposure times at room temperature and 37 degrees C (P < 0.0001, respectively). Higher concentrations of bupivacaine were associated with lower colony count. CONCLUSION: Our results show that preservative-free bupivacaine possesses a temperature- and concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, and S. aureus is more resistant to the bactericidal activity of bupivacaine than are S. epidermidis and E. coli.
TI  - Reassessment of the incubation time in a controlled clinical comparison of the BacT/Alert aerobic FAN bottle and standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically for the detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - This study assessed the minimum incubation time required to detect bloodstream infections during a controlled clinical comparison of the performance characteristics of the BacT/Alert aerobic FAN bottle and the standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically except on a selective basis. Blood was collected from adults with suspected bloodstream infections and inoculated into each bottle, which was monitored in the BacT/Alert Microbial Detection System. The anaerobic bottle was vented before incubation except when cultures were obtained from patients on the colorectal and gynecologic surgical and emergency services. Statistical analysis was limited to those culture sets in which each bottle was inoculated with > or = 8 mL of blood and bacterial growth was considered to be clinically significant. A total of 682 positive cultures from 243 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Significantly more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001), S. epidermidis (p < 0.001), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), Enterococcus spp. (p = 0.04), Escherichia coli (p = 0.03), all Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), and Candida spp. (p < 0.001) were detected by the aerobic FAN bottle. Significantly more septic episodes due to S. aureus, S. epidermidis, other coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Candida spp. were detected by the aerobic FAN bottle. Significantly more bacterial isolates were detected by the aerobic FAN whether or not antibiotics were being administered at the time of blood culture, whereas there were significantly fewer positive cultures in the vented standard anaerobic bottle when patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy than when they were not. All but 5% of positive cultures were detected within three days. Only six of the cultures requiring four or five days of incubation represented true misses, and only one of these six resulted in a change in therapy which, however, did not affect the patent's outcome.
TI  - [Detection of bacteremia in patients discharged from an emergency unit: study of  61 cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To know the prevalence, the clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremia episodes detected on discharged patients at the emergency unit, as well as the accordance of diagnostics and the predicting factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the cases with bacteria detected on discharged patients during 2 years (1995-1996) in an university hospital. We reported: age, sex isolated organism in blood cultures, bacteremia source, leukocytes count, presence of underlying conditions, and accordance between initial and final diagnosis. We compared the characteristics of the groups with bacteremia without apparent origin and the ones with evident clinical source. RESULTS: We detected 61 cases, the mean age was 55 years (SD = 21), and 54% were males. The most commonly isolated agent was E. coli (50%). The leukocytes count was higher 10 x 10(9)/l in 15%. The source of bacteremia was: urinary tract infection (54%) no clinical focus (31%), respiratory tract (11%) and biliary duct (3%). The 90% of urinary tract and the 71% of respiratory infections were correctly diagnosed. However only the 5% of bacteremias without apparent source was correctly diagnosed. We found these differences statistically a significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002). Underlying conditions were detected in the 84% of cases in bacteremia without apparently source: AIDS (22%), cirrhosis (22%), parenteral drugs addiction (17%) and venous catheter (17%). Comparing both groups, with apparent focus and without it, we found that the presence of underlying condition is the only independent factor which predispose to bacteremia (p = 0.000; RR = 4.6; IC 95% = 1.9-11.8). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bacteremia detected in discharged patients at the emergency unit seems acceptable. However those results suggest that we could decrease the number of patients with bacteremia without apparently source, because this group shows up to be the less successful in diagnosis. In patients with fever and no clinical focus in the emergency unit, it is useful to consider the presence of underlying factors to decide its management.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of cefdinir and its transfer to dialysate in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Cefdinir (CAS 91832-40-5) was administered orally as a 100-mg capsule (Cefzon) to a total of 12 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to investigate changes in the serum concentrations, excretion rate into the dialysate and serum-protein binding of cefdinir. Cmax values were 1.64-4.34 micrograms/ml, t1/2 values were 10.8-21.9 h., and AUC values were 31.1-73.1 micrograms.h/ml (0-30 h) in four patients given a single oral dose of 100 mg of cefdinir as a capsule. About 1 microgram/ml of cefdinir had still remained in the blood of all the patients 24 h after administration. The serum concentrations of cefdinir were dose-dependent in four patients of each group who were given an oral daily dose of 100 mg for 3 to 8 days and 200 mg (2 capsules) for 4 to 14 consecutive days. No marked change in laboratory test values or clinical symptoms before and after administration were observed in these dose regimes. Protein levels of 5.17-5.71 g/day were eliminated from the peritoneal dialysate and urine. Cefdinir inhibited 90 to 100% of the clinical isolates such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria causing catheter infection and peritonitis, and its antibacterial activity was stronger than that of amoxicillin (CAS 26787-78-0) or cefaclor (CAS 53944-73-3) against these clinical isolates.
TI  - Activities of LL-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  - Human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (HNP-1 to HNP-4) and the alpha-helical peptide LL-37. We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Influence of preformed alpha-helix and alpha-helix induction on the activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - One prominent class of cationic antibacterial peptides comprises the alpha-helical class, which is unstructured in free solution but folds into an amphipathic alpha-helix upon insertion into the membranes of target cells. To investigate the importance of alpha-helicity and its induction on interaction with membranes, a series of peptides was constructed based on a hybrid of moth cecropin (amino acids 1-8) and bee melittin (amino acids 1-18) peptides. The new peptides were predicted to have a high tendency to form alpha-helices or to have preformed alpha-helices by virtue of construction of a lactam bridge between glutamate and lysine side-chains at positions i and i + 4 at various locations along the primary sequence. In two examples where the use of lactam bridge constraints induced and stabilized alpha-helical structure in benign (aqueous buffer) and/or hydrophobic medium, there was a decrease in antibacterial activity relative to the linear counterparts. Thus the preformation of alpha-helix in solution was not necessarily beneficial to antimicrobial activity. In the one case where the lactam bridge did result in increased antibacterial activity (lower minimal inhibitory concentration values) it did not increase alpha-helical content in benign or hydrophobic medium. Broadly speaking, good activity of the peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlated best (r2 = 0.88) with a helican parameter which was calculated as the induction of alpha-helix in a membrane-mimicking environment divided by the alpha-helix formation under benign conditions. Interestingly, the activity of the lactam bridge peptide constructs correlated in part with alterations in bacterial outer or cytoplasmic membrane permeability.
TI  - The effect of successful contact lens wear on mucosal immunity of the eye.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of contact lens wear on the mucosal defenses of the outer eye against infection. DESIGN: A case-controlled study of daily contact lens wearers in their initial 6 months of contact lens wear. PARTICIPANTS: Contact lens wearers (mean age, 23.1 years; 47 subjects) were compared with age-matched control subjects (mean age, 24.7 years; 44 subjects). INTERVENTION: Outer eye defenses were studied by assay of tear constituents and quantitative conjunctival microbiology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antimicrobial activity of tears was studied by assay of total immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, albumin and lysozyme, and the ocular surface microbial load determined using quantitative microbiology of the conjunctival sac. RESULTS: The IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with E. coli (P = 0.03) and S. epidermidis (P = 0.068) were lower in contact lens wearers, but antibody:albumin ratios were not significantly different in the two groups. Contact lens wear also had no significant effect on tear IgA, albumin, or lysozyme or its ratios with albumin. Bacterial numbers and colonization rates for coagulase-negative staphylococci were greater in contact lens wearers than in age-matched control subjects. Corynebacterium sp. and non-Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.007) were isolated more frequently and in greater numbers from contact lens wearers. Colonization rates were increased for Corynebacterium sp., but non-Enterobacteriaceae were transient. In both daily contact lens wearers and age-matched control subjects, most conjunctival flora were transient rather than colonizing, and no subject developed an outer eye infection during the study. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that daily contact lens wear does not significantly alter the mucosal defenses of the outer eye that function to eliminate organisms from the conjunctival sac and prevent outer eye infection.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Sclerosing peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients: one center's experience and review of the literature.
AB  - Sclerosing peritonitis (SP) is a severe life-threatening condition for patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). This report reviews our experience and that reported in the literature concerning the prevalence of SP in CAPD patients, predisposing factors, and in particular, the role of peritonitis, its clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. A total of 1,288 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients entered our peritoneal dialysis (PD) program between September 1977 and September 1997, seven of whom (0.54%) developed SP. The annual incidence of SP was 0.37 per 1,000 patient years, male-to-female ratio was 2.5 (M/F:5/2), mean age was 39+/-16 (median, 37; range, 23 to 61) years, and the median duration on CAPD was 62 (range, 12 to 144) months. Five patients were on CAPD for > or =4 years and two for less than 4 years before they were diagnosed with SP. All SP patients presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction, and five patients had decreased solute or fluid removal and had to increase the daily dialysate volume (3/7) or the tonicity of the fluid (4.25%) (3/7) or to combine a regular hemodialysis (HD) session with CAPD (2/7). There was a mean weight loss of 5+/-6 (median, 2; range, 0 to 18) kg. All patients had an episode of peritonitis at a mean time of 2+/-1 (median, 1; range, 1 to 3) months before the diagnosis of SP. The peritonitis was due to Staphylococcus aureus in four and Staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and Escherichia coli in one each. The definitive diagnosis of SP was established by laparotomy in four patients or postmortem examination in one patient, while in the remaining two there was no surgical confirmation; however, we believe the diagnosis was extremely likely because of the presence of clinical and radiologic criteria for SP. After the diagnosis of SP, all patients had their catheters removed, CAPD was discontinued permanently, and they were transferred to HD. Although there are isolated case reports of successful outcomes after surgical intervention, especially in patients in whom a peritoneal "cocoon" is related to severe peritonitis, usually the prognosis following surgery is poor. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of SP, although this has not been confirmed by all investigators. Among our SP patients, five (72%) died of sepsis (3/5) in a mean period of 10+/-5 (median, 9; range, 6 to 17) months after the diagnosis of SP and two are still alive on HD. SP is a rare but serious complication of CAPD. Severe peritonitis, especially in patients on dialysis for more than 4 years, may lead to SP As the prevalence of SP increases in patients on long-term CAPD, early detection is important because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated microbiologic blood culture device for detection of bacteria in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated culture methods have been used by several investigators to  detect bacterial contamination of cellular blood components. We investigated several factors affecting detection by automated culture of bacteria in platelet concentrates (PCs). These factors included the initial contamination level in PCs, the PC sample volume, the PC sample time, and the white cell level in relation to bacteria levels in the PCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli was inoculated into freshly prepared PCs or white cell-reduced PCs to yield colony-forming unit (CFU) levels of 10, 1, or 0.1 per mL. At the time of inoculation (t=0) and at t=6, t=24, and t=48 hours, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mL samples of the contaminated PCs were transferred into culture bottles. The presence of bacteria in the culture bottles was subsequently monitored by an automated blood culturing instrument. Bacteria levels in the PC at the time of first automated culture detection were determined by quantitative plating. RESULTS: E. coli was detected in 92 percent of experiments when 1.0- or 2.0-mL samples were taken at t=6 hours. At t=24 hours, 100-percent detection was observed with all tested inoculation volumes; however, by that time, >10(7) CFU per mL of bacteria were present in every PC. For S. epidermidis, 89 percent and 83 percent of contaminated PCs were detected with a t=24 hour sampling time and 2.0- or 1.0-mL sampling volume. Seven of 36 PCs with a 2.0-mL sampling volume and 10 of 36 PCs with a 1.0-mL sampling volume contained >10(6) CFU per mL of S. epidermidis at the time of first detection. CONCLUSION: Data from this preliminary evaluation suggest that sampling times of 24 hours or more would be necessary to provide confidence in detection of E. coli or S. epidermidis in PCs using this culture method.
TI  - Changes in the biocide susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli cells associated with rapid attachment to plastic surfaces.
AB  - Differences in opacity between wells of a microtitre plate containing different volumes of inoculated growth medium reflected planktonic growth without any contribution from cells attached at the well surface. Simple algebra and a knowledge of the dependence of optical density upon sample path length (volume) for suspensions of differing cell density enables the generation of growth curves for attached populations (biofilms). In this manner, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined at various stages of growth (0-20 h), both for cells growing attached to the bases of the plate wells and, simultaneously, for cells growing in suspension above them. Biocides included cetrimide, polyhexamethylene biguanide, peracetic acid, phenoxyethanol and chloroxylenol. Results, expressed as planktonic:biofilm MIC ratios, showed susceptibility to change, not only as a function of attachment and biofilm formation, but also with respect to the nature of the chemical agent. In some instances, changes in susceptibility greater than twofold occurred immediately on attachment and could occur in the presence of biocide concentrations which exceeded the MIC.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion on PEG modified polyurethane surfaces.
AB  - Polyurethane surface was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (mol. wt. 1000, PEG1k) carrying terminal hydroxyl, amino and sulfonate groups, poly(ethylene glucol) (mol. wt. 3350, PEG3.4k) and PEG3.4k-Heparin, respectively. These surfaces were investigated for bacterial adhesion using S. epidermidis and E. coli in tryptic soya broth (TSB), brain heart infusion (BHI), and human plasma. All PEG modified surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion significantly and the adhesion level differs depending on surfaces as well as media. In the case of PEG1k surfaces, no reduction of S. epidermidis adhesion was demonstrated in TSB media, regardless of terminal functional groups of PEG1k. However, adhesion in plasma was reduced to the different degree, depending on terminal groups of PEG1k (least adhesion on sulfonated PEG surface). Relatively longer PEG surface (PEG3.4k) and PEG3.4k-heparin surface minimized bacterial adhesion in both media. In the case of E. coli adhesion, significant reduction in adherent bacteria was observed on all PEG1k, PEG3.4k, and PEG-heparin surfaces in both media compared to controls. In contrast, no reduction in bacterial adhesion was demonstrated on poly(propylene glycol) (PPG1k) grafted PU surface as compared to control PU. These results suggest that surface modification with PEG1k-SO3, PEG3.4k and PEG3.4k-heparin seems to be effective for prevention of bacterial adhesion and subsequent infection.
TI  - Management of animal bite injuries of the face: experience with 94 patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: Because of the large number of bacteria in the oral cavity, animal bite  wounds are generally contaminated, and their treatment is difficult because of the risk of infection, especially in extensive injuries. This report describes the management of a large series of patients and recommends treatment guidelines on the basis of the results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four animal bite wounds on the face and head were analyzed according to the type of animal, location and extent of the soft tissue wound, duration and type of surgical treatment, occurrence of infections and their pathogen spectrum, as well as the choice of antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Dogs caused 91% of the bite wounds. Infections developed in 4 of 53 patients who underwent primary wound closure with minor edge excision and prophylactic administration of oral penicillin. Without antibiotic administration, 2 of 15 patients had infections, which were treated on an outpatient basis. Of 26 patients with initially delayed treatment, 18 showed clinical inflammatory symptoms with a wide spectrum of pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus) on presentation. CONCLUSION: Extensive animal bite wounds on the face, even with soft tissue defects, should be treated according to the criteria of a esthetic reconstructive facial surgery. In view of the low infection rate, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not justified.
TI  - Cloning, purification and characterisation of the lipase from Staphylococcus epidermidis--comparison of the substrate selectivity with those of other microbial lipases.
AB  - On the chromosome of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A the lipase gene (gehSE1) is immediately flanked by the icaAA'BC operon, which is involved in biofilm formation. Since lipase production might play a role in staphylococcal skin colonisation as well, we studied the biochemical properties of the staphylococcal lipases more closely. The DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence revealed that gehSE1 is very similar to the lipase sequence of S. epidermidis strain 9. Like other staphylococcal lipases, gehSE1 is organised as a preproenzyme. The part of gehSE1 coding for the mature lipase was cloned and overexpressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal histidine tag in Escherichia coli. The lipase was purified to homogeneity using a combination of precipitation techniques, metal-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Biochemical characterisation showed that this lipase is closely related to the lipase from Staphylococcus aurelis NCTC8530. Both enzymes have a pH optimum around 6, are very stable at low pH, and need calcium as a cofactor for catalytic activity. The preferred substrates are small triacylglycerols, with a maximum activity toward tributyrylglycerol. Comparison of the substrate selectivity with those of other microbial lipases showed that phospholipids are generally poor substrates for lipases. An exception is the lipase from Staphylococcus hyicus, which prefers phospholipids as a substrate, distinguishing this staphylococcal lipase from other microbial lipases. These results are discussed in view of the structure/function relationships of staphylococcal lipases, and the possible involvement of these enzymes in biological processes such as skin colonisation and pathogenesis.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacteriological research data and laboratory symptoms of infection in the diagnosis of congenital and acquired infections].
AB  - The predisposition of the newborns to contract infections diseases is dependent upon the limited efficiency of their immune mechanisms. Congenital infections amount to 5.7% in the research material, and the acquired infections 1.15%. The isolation of the microorganism is the basis for treating infections-the profiles of the pathogenic bacterial in flora were subjected to analysis. Im generalised infections Stafphylococcus epidermidis makes 56.6% and E. Coli accounts for 87.5 of the infections of the urinary system. In our research the late sepsis and pneumonia are more frequently the result of the hospital infection (14.2%) in the cases of congenital infections-pneumonia and the infection of the urinary system (72%). Hematologic indicators such as: leucopenia, thormbocytopenia, I/T are distinct infection markers (those were found in 31% of the cases). The CRP protein shows the lowest values in congenital infections, still monitoring its level is useful for assessing the effectiveness of the undertaken antybacterial treatment. The newborns of male sex (58%) more often prone to infection. Pneumonia is the manifestation pertaining to an organ in 70% of congenital infections, the infection of urinary system amounts to 17.1%.
TI  - Activity of silver ions in different media.
AB  - A major problem in medicine is the large number of infections associated with implanted and indwelling devices. Silver coating of medical devices is believed to preserve infection resistance. Several in vitro and animal studies as well as clinical observations on silver-nylon, silver-intramedullary pins, silver-oxide-Foley catheters and silver-coated vascular protheses have been interpreted as successful for the prophylaxis of foreign-body infections. Nevertheless, these products have not been established in clinical use. In this study we have been able to present physico-chemical and pharmacological data as well as simple microbiological experiments explaining the reduced anti-microbial activity of silver-ions in some biological fluids.
TI  - Empiric therapy of bacterial infections in patients with severe neutropenia.
AB  - The urgent need to treat presumptive infections in neutropenic patients has meant that initial therapy is empiric based on the pathogens most likely to be responsible for the patient's rise in temperature or other symptoms of infection. The spectrum of causative pathogens has changed over time and reflects the availability and use of antimicrobial agents. Gram-positive organisms predominated in the 1940s and onward until the widespread use of early penicillins and cephalosporins effectively addressed this problem. The upsurge in infections in the 1970s and 1980s caused by Gram-negative organisms, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., has been supplanted by a new wave of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, this time predominantly Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the viridans streptococci. The fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefpirome) among other broad-spectrum beta-lactams, by virtue of their enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens and greater beta-lactamase stability, are promising candidates for use in the empiric management of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. Early clinical trial results are promising and should lead the way for further use of these compounds in this indication.
TI  - Mucin gene (MUC 2 and MUC 5AC) upregulation by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. In partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the Gram-negative organism Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the MUC 2 mucin gene [J.-D. Li, A. Dohrman, M. Gallup, S. Miyata, J. Gum, Y. Kim, J. Nadel, A. Prince, C. Basbaum, Transcriptional activation of mucin by P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94 (1997) 967-972]. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin genes other than MUC 2 are so regulated and whether Gram-positive organisms also contain mucin stimulatory activity. Results from in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays showed that P. aeruginosa upregulates MUC 5AC as well as MUC 2 in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. The upregulation of both genes by P. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. In addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. These data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices.
AB  - Antimicrobial coating of medical devices, including fracture fixation devices, has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. We examined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of titanium cylinders coated with the antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. The coated devices provided zones of inhibition against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, at baseline and up to 8 weeks after incubation of the coated cylinders in human serum at 37 degrees C. This durable antimicrobial activity was attributed to the relatively slow leaching of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol from the coated cylinders as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices may provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial protection against device-related infection.
TI  - Extracellular release of antigenic proteins by Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Screening a Helicobacter pylori genomic library with antisera raised against H. pylori broth culture supernatant resulted in the identification of six antigens: urease, HspB, Lpp20, DnaK, MsrA, and a cysteine-rich 28-kDa protein (designated HcpA). H. pylori antigens may be released into the extracellular space by multiple mechanisms, including specific secretion pathways, autolysis, and membrane vesicle formation.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans JH1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (J. D. Hillman, K. P. Johnson, and B. I. Yaphe, Infect. Immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS). The thermosensitive vector pTV1-OK harboring Tn917 was used to isolate a BLIS-deficient mutant, DM25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of insert DNA adjacent to Tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lanA and lanB) which have substantial homology to the Staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epiA) and a modifying enzyme gene (epiB) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. Although the BLIS activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated with JH1140 (a spontaneous mutant of JH1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). Agar could not substitute for agarose. Chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, DM25. The amino acid sequence of this band was determined by Edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. The results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lanA sequence. We observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an S. mutans lantibiotic, B-Ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. It also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. A proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.
TI  - Solution structure of the antimicrobial peptide ranalexin and a study of its interaction with perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine micelles.
AB  - Ranalexin, a 20-residue peptide isolated from the skin of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana displays antimicrobial activity. This peptide contains two cysteine residues in positions 14 and 20 linked by a disulphide bridge. Ranalexin was chemically synthesised and close antimicrobial activities were measured for the reduced and oxidised forms. The solution structure of ranalexin was determined by using circular dichroism, proton NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling techniques. The reduced and oxidised forms of ranalexin are mainly unstructured in water but display an alpha-helical structure spanning residues 8-15 and 8-17, respectively, in a trifluoroethanol/water mixture (3:7, by vol.). Ranalexin was found to interact with micelles of dodecylphosphocholine and to adopt a similar helical structure. Moreover, slow-exchanging amide protons located on the same side of the helix suggest that the hydrophobic face of the helix lies on the micelle surface. Hydrophobic residues of the poorly structured N-terminal part which are important for the biological activity are also involved in the interaction with micelles. Taken together, the results suggest that the disulphide bond does not strongly affect either the conformation or the antimicrobial activity of ranalexin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Incidence of postoperative wound infections in The Netherlands].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To inventory postoperative infections in Dutch hospitals. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: National organization for quality assurance in hospitals, Utrecht, the Netherlands. METHOD: In 36 Dutch hospitals data on surgical patients, surgical site infections and risk factors were collected, using standardised methods, as part of a quality system by which hospitals could compare their infection rates with the rates in the database. RESULTS: Surveillance of surgical site infections was introduced in 36/118 (31%) hospitals. Data on 32,869 surgical procedures were collected, 1115 (3.4%) surgical site infections were found. The infection rates by wound contamination class varied from 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-2.4) in clean wounds to 11% (95% CI: 9.3-12.8) in dirty wounds; the infection rates by duration of operation varied from 3% (95% CI: 2.8-3.2) in operations lasting less than two hours to 10.8% (95% CI: 6.0-18.5) in operations lasting more than 8 hours; the infection rate by ASA classification varied from 2.7% (95% CI: 2.3-3.2) in class I to 15.5% (95% CI: 8.4-26.5) in patients in class IV. Advanced age, emergency, preoperative stay were recognised as risk factors. The infection rates in the most frequently recorded types of operation varied from 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0-1.1) in varicose veins to 9.8% (95% CI: 7.2-13.2) in femoral bypass grafts. The use of antimicrobial prophylaxis varied per type of operation. The micro-organisms most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Of the infections 32% were identified in the first week following surgery. Of the infected patients 88% stayed in hospital during one or more days following the onset of infection.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of a hydrophilic central venous catheter loaded with silver to  prevent microbial colonization.
AB  - A method was developed to load the surface of a central venous catheter with silver to prevent bacterial colonization. Silver confers a broad antimicrobial activity with a relatively low risk of resistance. Catheters were incubated with a silver nitrate solution in different concentrations. The solvent, incubation temperature and incubation period were varied to examine the influence on the catheter loading. With increasing incubation temperature, time and concentration of silver nitrate, higher rates of silver elution were observed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, by using ethanol-water as a solvent instead of pure water, the amount of silver bound to the catheter surface was enhanced. The release of silver from the catheter surface is mainly controlled by first order kinetics. Antimicrobial efficacy of the modified catheter, in comparison to unloaded catheters, was tested in a stationary and a dynamic model with different microorganisms. Adherence experiments with Candida albicans showed almost complete inhibition of growth during a period of 72 hours, including initial adherence. While initial adherence of bacteria could not be prevented, these experiments showed an excellent reduction of bacterial colonization. In a perfusion model, adhesion of E. coli could be reduced for at least seven days. Further studies are planned to examine prolonged antimicrobial effects.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficiency of hydrogel contact lens soaking solutions marketed in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial efficiency of 20 commercially available solutions for soaking and rinsing soft contact lenses was studied in relation to 5 bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Serratia marcescens) and 1 fungus (Candida albicans). Each product was separately inoculated with each of six microorganisms, and samples of the inoculated contact lens solutions were taken at predetermined times, placed in a recovery medium, and incubated. Where there was growth, the colonies were counted. There were differences in performance even between solutions labeled as having the same antimicrobial content. One of the solutions marketed in Spain to soak hydrogel contact lenses failed to inactivate all six test strains.
TI  - [Genotyping of isolates of bacteria and Candida].
AB  - Strain differentiation of Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. REA of 19 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. Fifty-three isolates of S. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of REA pattern. REA patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those from different Staphylococcus species. A total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 S. pneumoniae isolates. There was some correlation between the REA patterns and serotypes. In addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. Sixteen isolates of E. coli O157 and 18 isolates of E. coli O25 were analyzed by REA with HaeIII. Among 14 epidemiologically unrelated E. coli O157:H7 isolates, REA patterns were either identical or differed only by a few fragment bands. REA patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing E. coli O25 from an outbreak were identical. Eight distinct REA patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic C. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. Candida strains belonging to different six Candida species were analysed by REA. All C. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains were divided into 37 groups according to the REA patterns. Each Candida strain showed species-specific REA patterns. Twenty-one isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by PCR with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of IS6110(IS6110-PCR). The results of PCR of 19 M. tuberculosis isolates and 2 M. bovis BCG isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. Our results demonstrated that REA of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII was a useful tool for strain differentiation. By comparing the species-specific REA patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of Candida and Staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. Because IS6110-PCR is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate M. tuberculosis strains.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - [Coxitis in the newborn infant and infant. Diagnosis and therapy].
AB  - From 198 o 1996 (12 years) we saw 24 neonates and small infants with septic arthritis of the hip joint. A minority of these infants was simultaneously affected by osteomyelitis of the femoral neck or the acetabulum. Clinical signs are a painful leg, pseudoparalysis, uneasiness and refusal to drink. Quantitative measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) are more reliable then leucocyte count and sedimentation rate. Ultrasound images yield early information about capsular swelling and septic effusion; in late cases US can visualize femoral neck necrosis. Emergency arthrotomy to relieve the joint from septic effusion, bacteriological specimens and capsular biopsy are mandatory. Intravenous application of a second-generation cephalosporin as antibiotic has proven effective. We have been using cefuroxim for the past 10 years, changed if necessary according to the antibiogram. Parenteral antibiotic treatment is continued for an average of 3 weeks, followed by oral treatment for another 3 weeks. CRP normalisation monitors the cure from the disease. Our 24 cases included 7 with group B streptococci 2 with Staphylococcus aureus, 2 with Staphylococcus epidermidis and 2 with Escherichia coli. In 8 cases no germs could be cultured; 6 of them had outside antibiotic treatment before being transferred. If treatment was initiated within 3 days, healing without residuals was the rule. In 18 cases with early and sufficient treatment no sequelae were observed. With delay of treatment for several days, moderate osteomyelitic changes of the neck and the acetabulum were observed. In a case with delay of surgical treatment for 5 weeks, complete destruction of the hip joint occurred, causing a poor final result.
TI  - A series of meso-tris (N-methyl-pyridiniumyl)-(4-alkylamidophenyl) porphyrins: synthesis, interaction with DNA and antibacterial activity.
AB  - A series of meso-5,10,15-tris(N-methyl-4-pyridiniumyl)-20-(4-alkylamidophen yl) porphyrins were synthesized by derivatizing the amino group on the phenyl ring with the following hydrophobic groups: -C(O)C7F15, -C(O)CH=CH2, C(O)CH3, -C(O)C7H15, and -C(O)C15H31. The cationic tris-pyridiumyl porphyrin core serves as a DNA binding motif and a photosensitizer to photomodify DNA molecules. The changes of the UV-Vis absorption spectra during the titration of these porphyrins with calf thymus DNA revealed a large bathochromic shift (up to 14 nm) and a hypochromicity (up to 55%) of the porphyrins Soret bands, usually considered as proof of porphyrin intercalation into DNA. Association constants (K) calculated according to the McGhee and von Hippel model, were in the range of 10(6)-10(7) M(-1). An increase in hydrophobicity of the substituents at the 20-meso-position produced higher binding affinity. These porphyrins caused photomodification of the supercoiled plasmid DNA when a green laser beam at 532 nm was applied. Those with higher surface activity acted more efficiently as DNA photomodifiers. The porphyrin with a perfluorinated alkyl chain (-COC7F15) at the meso-20-position inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, or S. epidermidis). Other porphyrins exhibited moderate activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - An infection inhibiting urinary catheter material.
AB  - Catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. An infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. The material consists of silicone rubber elastomer compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (CHG) matrix. The antibiotic is released in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. A method was established for adding CHG to silicone rubber. To protect the CHG, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates CHG release from the elastomer. It was found that CHG is randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by diffusion. The antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% CHG by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. The new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.). The release rate of CHG was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With 5% CHG loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. This new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - In vivo reaction of affinity-tag-labelled epidermin precursor peptide with flavoenzyme EpiD.
AB  - The Staphylococcus epidermidis genes encoding the His-tag-labelled epidermin precursor peptide EpiA and the flavoenzyme EpiD or the mutant protein EpiD-G93D, which lacks the coenzyme, were co-expressed and the proteins were synthesized in vivo in Escherichia coli. Only in the presence of EpiD was the precursor peptide converted to a reaction product with a decrease in mass of 44-46 Da. This result confirms the in vitro experiments carried out with purified EpiA and purified EpiD from Staphylococcus epidermidis [Kupke et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5653-5659]. EpiD catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue of EpiA to a [Z]-enethiol structure. In the presence of EpiD, the amount of purified (modified) peptide EpiA was several-fold higher than in the presence of EpiD-G93D, indicating that the stabilization of EpiA against proteolysis is due to an interaction with EpiD or to the presence of the C-terminal modification. The presented experimental approach will be valuable for the analysis of enzymes that catalyze posttranslational modification reaction of peptides and proteins.
TI  - [Factors in the persistence of opportunistic microorganisms in dysbacteriosis of  the gastrointestinal tract].
AB  - The presence of correlation between the quantitative content of individual carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds of microbial origin in feces and the degree of the antagonistic activity of feces was proved in experiments on conventional laboratory rats receiving therapeutic doses of tetracyclin and pefloxacin for 8 days. Antagonistic activity was regarded as one of the factors of the colonization resistance of the intestine to the invasion of opportunistic microorganisms, and microbial metabolites studied in this work were regarded as factors contributing to the persistence of these microorganisms.
TI  - [The photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  - The method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. The new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ALA of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ALA. The elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.
TI  - Much ado about nothing: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The pathogenic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has received a  voluminous amount of notoriety. The four major reasons are its morbidity, mortality rate, cost of treatment, and constant appearance in intensive care units. Both Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis (MRSE) account for 82% of our gram-positive wound isolates, whereas the gram-negative account for 34% of all isolates. Therefore we compared the morbidity, mortality rate, and cost factors related to MRSA-MRSE and gram-negative infections for a 4-year period, assessing more than 214 documented infections. Morbidity and mortality rates were minor for MRSA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli accounted for 57.5% of the total gram-negative isolates. Gram-negative antimicrobial therapy usually requires two therapeutic drugs, which increases morbidity and costs, whereas the staphylococci usually can be treated by one antimicrobial. During this period there were 47 gram-negative infections requiring 10 to 15 additional days of hospital stay, with a daily antibiotic cost of $293.40. Costs for MRSA or MRSE are 28% less. Therefore our preoccupation with MRSA or MRSE infections is unwarranted and unsubstantiated.
TI  - Microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. The bacteria tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three fungal species also were tested: Aspergillus fumigatus, Paecilomyces variotii, and Candida albicans. In the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. In the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. They were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. None of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. In contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. Samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. Of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. In most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. In only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. The data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for extended periods of time.
TI  - Susceptibility of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant hospital bacteria to disinfectants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria  exhibited altered susceptibility to disinfectants. DESIGN: Antibiotic-susceptible bacteria were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria were obtained from clinical isolates, including: S aureus, S epidermidis, E coli, Enterococcus species, K pneumoniae, and P aeruginosa. The Association of Official Analytical Chemist's use-dilution method was used to test these 12 strains of 7 bacterial pathogens for their susceptibility to a phenol and a quaternary ammonium compound. For five pathogens, we tested a susceptible and a more resistant strain in 20 comparative trials (5 pathogens, 2 disinfectants, 2 dilutions per disinfectant). RESULTS: In our 20 comparative trials, the antibiotic-resistant strains exhibited an increased resistance to the disinfectant in only a single instance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the development of antibiotic resistance does not appear to be correlated to increased resistance to disinfectants.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - [Changes in patterns and resistances of bacteria from 731 patients with bacteremia in 11 years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the changes in patterns and resistances of bacteria from patients with bacteremia in 11 years. METHODS: Diffusion tests were used to measure the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the patients with bacteremia. RESULTS: The proportion of staphylococcus epidermidis in bacteremia increased significantly. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in bacteremia caused by staphyiococcus increased markedly. Resistance of MRSA and methlcillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) to penicillin, and gentamycin increased significantly. Compared 1986-1990, with 1991-1996, the resistance of S. epidermidis to penicillin, erythromycin and methicillin increased markedly, so did resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbenicillin, and piperacillin, resistance of E. coli to gentamycin and cefoperazone, resistance of klebsiella to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The resistance of enterobacteriaceae which induced beta-lactamase to the first to the third generation of cephalosporins was relatively high. CONCLUSION: The resistance of bacteria to the commonly used antibiotics was produced in various degrees.

TI  - Epidemiology of infections in the adult medical intensive care unit of a cancer hospital.
AB  - A prospective collection of positive antimicrobial cultures was performed over 12 consecutive months in the medical intensive care unit of a cancer hospital. In all, 144 infections and 163 pathogens were documented during 87 of the 528 admissions. Lung, urinary, ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and bacteraemia were the most frequently documented. Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas species were the most common pathogens. Gram-positive strains were observed predominantly during monomicrobial bacteraemia (48.9%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were found in 58% and 92% of the isolated strains respectively. No particular outbreak was identified. A further prospective study will be necessary to evaluate the impact of the antibiotic use on the selection of resistant strains in our ICU.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Growth of bacteria in platelet concentrates obtained from whole blood stored for  16 hours at 22 degrees C before component preparation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cooling whole blood to 22 degrees C  immediately after collection allows it to be held for up to 16 hours before component preparation (overnight-hold method) without a significant decrease in the quality of components obtained. A study was designated to evaluate the effect of the overnight-hold method on the growth of bacteria in experimentally contaminated blood units. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty whole-blood units were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (300 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL; n = 10) or Escherichia coli (50 CFU/mL; n = 10) immediately after collection. Half the units of each group were fractionated 6 hours after collection and the other half after storage for 16 hours at 22 degrees C. Twenty additional whole-blood units were divided in two equal parts, one of which was white cell reduced before inoculation. These 40 half-units were inoculated with S. epidermidis or E. coli and processed by the overnight-hold method. The growth of bacteria was assessed in platelet concentrates on the second and fifth days of storage, in packed red cells on Day 35, and in fresh-frozen plasma after 60 days. RESULTS: No bacteria growth was detected in plasma or red cell units. On the second day of storage, both bacteria strains grew more slowly in platelet concentrates obtained from blood processed by the overnight-hold method. This difference disappeared for S. epidermidis on the fifth day. When white cell-reduced and non-white cell-reduced whole-blood units were compared, platelet concentrates from the latter showed a delayed growth of both bacterial strains on the second and fifty days of storage. CONCLUSION: Prolonged storage of whole-blood units at 22 degrees C before component preparation delays bacteria growth. This effect seems to be mediated by white cells.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives on microorganisms in the human skin flora.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives at body temperature and at room temperature is not known. We studied the bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.08% methyl para-oxybenzoate and 0.02% propyl para-aminobenzoate as preservatives and of the preservatives alone at 37 degrees C and at room temperature on two strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, two strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and one strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. METHODS: The pathogen was exposed to 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives or to the preservatives alone for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours at 37 degrees C and at room temperature. The inocula from these suspensions were cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees C after the antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine was inactivated by 1:1,000 dilution with physiological saline. RESULTS: The 1- through 12-hour exposures of four strains of S. aureus to 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives at room temperature reduced the mean colony count by 24.2%, 49.2%, 71.3%, and 89.6%, respectively, and the exposure at 37 degrees C reduced the count by 74.1%, 95.2%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. The differences for 1- through 12-hour exposures were significant (P < .001). The percentage kill in the strains of E. coli and S. epidermidis was significantly higher than that in the strains of S. aureus at all exposure times at room temperature (E. coli, P < .001; S. epidermidis, P < .0001) and at 1- and 3-hour exposures at 37 degrees C (E. coli, P < .001; S. epidermidis, P < .0001). The bactericidal activity of the preservatives was markedly lower that that of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives is stronger at body temperature than at room temperature; the bactericidal activity may be due, to a large extent, to bupivacaine rather than to the preservatives; and S. aureus is more resistant to the bactericidal activity of bupivacaine than are S. epidermidis and E. coli.
TI  - A simple artificial urine for the growth of urinary pathogens.
AB  - A simple artificial urine medium (AUM) has been developed which provides conditions similar to that found in human urine. AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 10(8) cfu ml-1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. At the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. The highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours and 0800 hours, prior to operation. When applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). These mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. CONCLUSION: Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. This fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomanas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Development of resistance to difuracil (PAP-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  - Possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or N-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(N'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (PAP-49) in Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. It was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. The most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. During the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (E.coli) or was even somewhat higher (S. aureus and Streptococcus sp.). After that a new increase of the resistance was observed. The most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in Streptococcus sp. and the least marked in Staphylococcus sp. and E.coli. Combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to S.epidermidis, S. pneumonase, E.coli and P.mirabilis. The most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.
TI  - Production of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha by peritoneal macrophages depends on the bacterial species and the inoculum.
AB  - Peritoneal macrophages (PMs) are very potent producers of proinflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. After contact with invading micro-organisms, PMs produce different cytokines, both pro- and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, they are crucial in the regulation of inflammatory events. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the production of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha is dependent on the bacterial species used. PMs were harvested from spent peritoneal dialysis effluent and subsequently stimulated with five strains of bacteria in two different concentrations. After 24 hours of stimulation, supernatants were harvested and analyzed for both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha content. IL-1 beta was measured with a commercial ELISA, and TNF-alpha was determined with a bioassay. Both the IL-1 beta and the TNF-alpha production were species-dependent. One strain of Staphylococcus aureus and one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis induced a markedly higher response in both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha than the other species. This response was also dose-dependent, and this holds true for all species. In conclusion, the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha response by PMs is both species- and dose-dependent.
TI  - Influence of heparin coating on in vitro bacterial adherence to poly(vinyl chloride) segments.
AB  - End-point attached, covalently bound heparin has been shown to be effective in preventing activation of the coagulation cascade by biomaterials. Data concerning its possible influence on bacterial attachment and resistance to biomaterial-associated infection are, so far, lacking. In the present work, the in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, one isolate of each species, to plain poly(vinyl chloride) (plain PVC) and heparin coated poly(vinyl chloride) (EPA-PVC) segments was compared. Also, the influence of precoating the segments with human normal plasma for 2 h was studied. 35S-Methionine was used to radiolabel bacteria. The segments were exposed to bacterial suspensions of approximately 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter at 37 degrees C for 0.5-6 h. Following repeated washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), radioactivity associated with the segments was measured. Plain PVC as compared to EPA-PVC bound significantly more cells of all three tested species. Plasma precoating significantly decreased adherence of the tested species to plain PVC but did not affect the binding to EPA-PVC. However, after precoating with human plasma, EPA-PVC compared to plain PVC showed a higher binding of S. aureus which might possibly be due to bridging effects of fibronectin or other plasma proteins, interacting with S. aureus.
TI  - [Adhesive properties of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection to the urinary bladder].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically isolated Staphylococcus epidermidis KK3-75, Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14, and Escherichia coli TF6-27 were subjected to test for bladder lodgments. METHODS: Experimental cystitis on mice was investigated pathologically by light, confocal laser, and electron microscope after intravesical injection of cell suspensions of the strains. Bacterial affinities with bladder mucosal proteins and with extracellular components were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pathological findings of experimental cystitis revealed prominent infiltration of neutrophils except for those that were challenged with Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14. Capsule-like structures were demonstrated for the other two strains. Each strain showed histological tropism within the tissue sections, which correlated with the capability to bind the respective extracellular matrix components tested. Type I collagen bound only to cellular extracts of Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14 and Escherichia coli TF6-27, whereas fibronectin and type IV collagen bound only to those of Staphylococcus epidermidis KK3-75 and Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14. Bladder mucosal proteins had a variety of ability to bind cell surface proteins of each strain. Bacterial cell surface binding of all except for two of the bladder mucosal proteins detected was inhibited by extracellular matrix components. CONCLUSION: These experimental results suggest that the bacterial affinity of the bladder restricted by strain specific cell surface properties may be important for explanation in the difference of occurrence and progression of urinary tract infections caused by each strain.
TI  - Infection around joint replacements in patients who have a renal or liver transplantation.
AB  - The results of thirty-five joint (hip or knee) replacements in nineteen patients  who had an organ transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. The patients received a standard immunosuppressive induction regimen at the time of the transplantation and were maintained on a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine A. All patients received antibiotics perioperatively, but antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was not used for any procedure. Six joint replacements, in three patients who were an average of 48.2 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, were performed before a renal transplantation. Twenty-four joint replacements, in fourteen patients who were an average of 40.9 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, were performed after an organ transplantation. Two patients, who were an average of 53.8 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, each had a joint replacement both before and after a liver transplantation (a total of five joint replacements). The average duration of follow-up from the first joint replacement was 8.8 years (range, one to twenty-three years). The Harris hip score or The Hospital for Special Surgery knee score was determined at the time of the latest follow-up examination. An infection developed around the implant in five patients who had had the joint replacement after a transplantation. The average interval from implantation of the prosthesis until detection of the infection was 3.4 years (range, one to six years). One patient who had a liver transplant was infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and another one was infected with Escherichia coli. One patient who had a renal transplant was infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis; one, with Enterococcus; and one, with Serratia marcescens. We found that patients who had a joint replacement after an organ transplantation had a very high risk of devastating infection. The rate of such infection was 19 per cent (five of twenty-seven joint replacements in sixteen patients).
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  - Possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. In the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. To date, various bacterial species have been reported, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. Antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between February of 1993 and July of 1994 at the UCLA Medical Center. The implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and Dacron (6 percent). The implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). Of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. Forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then Escherichia coli (1.5 percent). No fungal infections were identified. Culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. The frequency (47 percent) and types (P. acnes and S. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of femA and femB from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - A DNA fragment was identified and cloned from Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se) using femA from S. aureus (Sa) as a heterologous hybridization probe. DNA sequence analysis of a portion of this clone revealed two complete ORFs highly related to femA and femB of Sa. The genomic arrangement of the Se femA/B complex was nearly identical to that observed in Sa. Intra- and interspecies relatedness of these genes and conservation of genomic organization were consistent with gene duplication of one of these genes in an ancestral organism. Recombinant FEMA, produced in Escherichia coli (Ec), was purified to near homogeneity. Identity of the purified protein was verified by N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence analysis.
TI  - Interleukin-10, interferon gamma, interleukin-2, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha detected during peritonitis in the dialysate and serum of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze interleukin (IL)-10, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-2, and soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2R alpha) in the dialysate and serum of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Samples from dialysate bags were collected during the initial month of dialysis. During peritonitis, samples were collected from the first three bags on the day of admittance to the hospital and from the night bags on days 3 and 10. Serum samples were drawn on days 1 and 10. RESULTS: IL-10 was detected in all dialysate samples except one on the first day of infection, with a peak median level of 50 pg/mL and a slow decrease thereafter. In serum the median levels never exceeded detectable levels. Patients infected with Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus had higher IL-10 levels in dialysate on day 3 as compared to the remaining patients (p < 0.05). If the catheter had to be drawn, because of persistent cloudy dialysate, the IL-10 levels remained elevated for a longer time (p < 0.05). IFN-gamma and IL-2 were detected only in the dialysate of patients infected with either S. aureus or S. epidermidis. Only one serum sample showed increased IFN-gamma. SIL-2R alpha was found in all the serum and dialysis samples from the first day of infection. Contrary to the analyzed cytokines, the receptor showed severalfold higher levels in serum as compared to the dialysate. During the infection the receptor levels in the dialysate increased, while they remained stationary in the serum, indicating a local production. CONCLUSION: This is the first time IL-10 has been demonstrated in the dialysate during peritonitis in CAPD patients. In view of its role as a suppressor of the immune and inflammatory responses, it is a potentially important observation, which might have clinical implications in the future.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  - Siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. Several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. Overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). E. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-OH-N-OH-delta-N-acetyl-L-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). B. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine B and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. P. multocida and P. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. Individual siderophores did not promote S. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. The antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. Conjugate-resistant E. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
TI  - Measurement of bacterial growth rates on polymers.
AB  - A video microscope system and a mathematical model were developed to observe and  model the early stage of bacterial growth on polymer surfaces. Glass slides were coated with polyorthoester, poly(L-lactic acid), and polysulfone, and inserted into a laminar flow cell to expose them to bacterial cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. The free energy of adhesion (delta Fadh) was determined from contact-angle measurements. The microscopic observations along with the mathematical model allowed measurement of the rates of adhesion, release, and growth. The growth rate of P. aeruginosa on the various surfaces correlated to the delta Fadh. The growth rates of all species on all of the surfaces were slower than the growth rates of the bacteria in suspension. The mathematical model is valid for early growth before the bacteria form a complete monolayer, and is useful in predicting and modeling early growth of bacteria on implanted biomaterials.
TI  - Gallbladder stones analyzes, bile and wound cultures in cholelithiasis.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-two consecutive cases of cholelithiasis were studied. The gallbladder stones were analyzed to determine the constituents, the bile specimens were cultured and correlated with the cultures when wound infection occurred. Mixed gallstones were the commonest type (58.5%), pigment stones (27%) and cholesterol stones (14.5%). Positive bile cultures were found in 41 patients (27%) and Escherichia coli was the commonest organism isolated. The rate of wound infection was 14.5% and the most common organism cultured from the wound was staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water.
AB  - We tested the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. The number of bacteria was reduced below detection limit following incubation in superoxidized water for 10 s. The bactericidal activity of superoxidized water was similar to that of 80% ethanol, but superior to that of 0.1% chlorhexidine and 0.02% povidone iodine. We conclude that superoxidized water is a low cost but powerful disinfectant.
TI  - A randomized prospective comparison of antibiotic tissue levels in the corpora cavernosa of patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation using gentamicin plus cefazolin versus an oral fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis.
AB  - PURPOSE: We performed a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy, safety and cost of parenteral antibiotics and oral fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis in penile prosthesis surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively randomized 20 consecutive patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery to receive ofloxacin orally or gentamicin and cefazolin parenterally followed by cephradine orally. Intraoperatively corpora cavernosa tissue and simultaneous peripheral serum samples were evaluated for antibiotic levels. Median followup was 16 months (range 8 to 21, mean 15.35). RESULTS: There were no implant losses or reoperations and complications were comparable in the 2 groups. The difference in mean serum-to-tissue ratios of ofloxacin versus the combination of cefazolin and gentamicin was statistically significant (p < 0.03). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin met or exceeded those of the 2 most common offending organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, in 80% of patients, which was comparable to the results of the parenteral regimen. Cost savings of the medications alone were more than $250,000 in the ofloxacin group. By eliminating a hospital stay of the 25,000 cases of penile prosthesis placement in the United States yearly a total cost savings of more than $36 million would be realized. CONCLUSIONS: When oral ofloxacin is given for prophylaxis in penile implant surgery, the procedure may be performed on an outpatient basis and health care dollars are saved.
TI  - Volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (BacT/Alert, Organon Teknika). DESIGN: Common neonatal pathogens, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS): one American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain and one clinical isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans, were seeded into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 CFU/ml). For each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. Blood culture bottles were incubated in the BacT/Alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. All bottles were subcultured on plated media. DATA ANALYSIS: The Poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding at least one viable CFU per inoculated culture bottle. The fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. RESULTS: Plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. The false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. The positivity index for the GBS clinical isolate was 1.13, for the GBS ATCC isolate 0.96, for S. epidermidis 0.94, for C. albicans 0.97, and for E. coli 0.95. There was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. CONCLUSIONS: If one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the BacT/Alert system will detect growth rapidly. Because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 CFU/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. One to two milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.
TI  - Ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli by human peritoneal mesothelial cells.
AB  - In the present study we examined whether mesothelial cells can ingest and digest  bacteria. The results showed that all strains were ingested. Ingested staphylococci proliferated abundantly, and only a few were digested. Escherichia coli, however, was digested during the first 8 h, whereafter the mesothelial cells disintegrated and proliferation of bacteria could be observed. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - Identification and analysis of a gene encoding a Fur-like protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - A gene (fur) for a Fur-like protein was identified on a 1.1 kb chromosomal DNA fragment of Staphylococcus epidermidis BN 280; the fur gene is followed by an open reading frame coding for the N-terminus of a putative superoxide dismutase. Within the -35 promoter region of both genes, as sequence motif was detected with low similarity to Fur-binding regulatory DNA segments, the so-called Fur boxes. Fur titration in Escherichia coli strain H1717 demonstrated that the E. coli Fur protein binds to the Fur box of the promoter region of the S. epidermidis fur gene. The S. epidermidis Fur protein was expressed in E. coli as indicated by the formation of inactive dimers with the chimeric repressor CI(N)-Fur(C) (Stojiljkovic, I. and Hantke. K. (1995) Mol. Gen. Genet. 247, 199-205), but was not able to complement the Fur mutation in E. coli H1681.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cecropins.
AB  - The lytic peptides, cecropins, were originally isolated from the haemolymph of the giant silk moth, Hyalophora cecropia and possess antibacterial and anticancer activity in vitro. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of these peptides against human pathogens using standardised assay techniques, and the activity of cecropin B on outer and inner bacterial membranes. From a panel of 15 organisms, Gram-negative bacteria were generally more sensitive to cecropins than Gram-positive organisms, especially the lipopolysaccharide defective mutant, Escherichia coli BUE55. Cecropins B and P1 shared similar MIC values whereas Shiva-1, a cecropin B analogue, was less active. Through combination studies with hydrophobic antibiotics and electron microscopy, cecropin B was shown to disrupt the bacterial outer membrane. Protoplasts of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant to cecropin B, suggesting that the cytoplasmic membranes of Gram-positive organisms were inherently more resistant to the peptide.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - The associated microflora to the larvae of human bot fly Dermatobia hominis L. Jr. (Diptera: Cuterebridae) and its furuncular lesions in cattle.
AB  - The microflora associated to furuncular lesions, larvae and pupae of Dermatobia hominis, as well as the relationships between parasite, host and microflora associated, as a comprehensive microsystem, has been studied. One hundred and two furuncular myiasis due to D. hominis larvae in several breeds of cattle were studied and the following bacterial species were significant: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. warneri, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Closely related, the microflora associated to 141 samples from first, second, third instar larva and both external surface and larval cavities has been studied. The representative associated microflora to the larvae were: S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. hycus and Moraxella phenylpiruvica, Moerella wisconsiensis, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, M. phenylpiruvica, M. wisconsiensis, P. mirabilis and P. rettgeri were the representative microflora associated to 64 pupae of D. hominis.
TI  - [The dynamics of the species composition and antilysozymal activity of ejaculate  microflora under the action of local hyperthermia].
AB  - Changes in the antilysozyme activity of bacteria under the action of high temperature and short-wave hyperthermia have been studied. The regulating influence of these factors on the species composition and persistence characteristics of the microflora of ejaculate obtained from sterile patients has been demonstrated. A method for the treatment of male sterility is proposed.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Significance of endotoxin in lethal synergy between bacteria associated with sudden infant death syndrome: follow up study.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the role of endotoxin in synergy between bacterial toxins associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: Extracellular toxins of 13 isolates of Staphylococcus from SIDS victims and matched healthy infants were tested for lethal toxicity in chick embryos with and without standard endotoxin (used at 1.00 ng/embryo). Endotoxin and toxins from staphylococci were used at dilutions with negligible lethality. RESULTS: Simultaneous injection of non-lethal levels of endotoxin and toxins from 11 of the 13 staphylococcal isolates tested produced lethal toxicity that was 111 to 613% greater than expected by an additive effect alone. This was highly significant and occurred even in the absence of staphylococcal enterotoxins or toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. CONCLUSION: Endotoxin enhancement of staphylococcal toxin lethality could be partly responsible for the clinical outcome in SIDS.
TI  - Bleed of and biologic response to triglyceride filler used in radiolucent breast  implants.
AB  - Radiolucent breast implants filled with triglyceride oil have recently entered limited clinical trials. To investigate the questions of oil bleed and the fate of triglycerides that might escape from ruptured breast implants, experiments reported here used peanut oil labeled with radioisotopes so that it could be traced in the urine, feces, and organs of two groups of rabbits. In one experiment, 18 rabbits were implanted with peanut oil-filled implants labeled with tritium to determine whether triglycerides diffuse across silicone elastomer shells. In another experiment, 19 rabbits were injected with 14C-labeled peanut oil to study what might happen to the oil if an implant ruptures. At the end of the follow-up period, we measured radioisotope levels in tissue samples taken from the periprosthetic capsule or injection site of each rabbit, as well as from major organs and the subcutaneous fat on the dorsum opposite the experimental site. One experiment revealed that triglycerides do bleed across the implant shells. Tritium levels were highest in the implant capsule, the omentum, the aorta, and the subcutaneous fat on the nonexperimental side. In the experiment simulating implant rupture, 14C levels were above the background radiation count at the injection site and in the same tissue sites as in the bleed experiment. Both in vivo radiolabeling studies indicate that triglycerides freed from implants by means of bleed or rupture would be absorbed, metabolized, and either excreted or redistributed to the body's normal fat storage sites if they are not needed for energy. In a third in vitro experiment, triglyceride oil specimens were inoculated with various microorganisms associated with wound infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. The data demonstrate that neutral triglycerides used as a breast implant filler do not support growth of common infection-producing bacteria and suggest that triglycerides may have bactericidal properties.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact DAPI-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identify bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Influence of temperature on mutational resistance to 4-quinolones.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ciprofloxacin (CAS 85721-33-1),  ofloxacin (CAS 82419-36-1) or levofloxacin (CAS 100986-85-4) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined at 37, 30 and 25 degrees C on nutrient agar. With E. coli and S. aureus, reducing the incubation temperature from 37 to 30 to 25 degrees C decreased the MIC values for each drug. With P. aeruginosa, temperature reduction also decreased the MIC values for ciprofloxacin but increased the MICs for ofloxacin or levofloxacin. With S. epidermidis, temperature reduction increased the MICs for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin but with levofloxacin the MICs were identical at 37 or 25 degrees C but higher at 30 degrees C. Mutants of these bacterial species were selected on nutrient agar containing five times their respective MICs of the 4-quinolones at 37, 30 and 25 degrees C. with S. epidermidis, temperature reduction always reduced its mutation frequency to resist 4-quinolones, whereas with the other three species the effect of temperature was more variable, and in some instances even elevated their mutation rates.
TI  - Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone T-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: T-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. To prevent these, the choice of T-tube material may be of importance. METHODS: Transected common bile ducts (CBDs) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone T-tubes, or without a T-tube. RESULTS: After 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 CBDs with and in 1 of 5 CBDs without a T-tube (p < 0.05). By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) four of five latex and none of five silicone T-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). All tubes remained patent. Segments of T-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. Sonication and SEM showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to T-tubes. Two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. Less infectious complications occur if T-tubes are omitted.
TI  - Endophthalmitis in patients with retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the treatment and outcomes of patients presenting with concurrent endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification between 1990 and 1994. RESULTS: Five patients were identified with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In all patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci were cultured from the vitreous fluid. One patient also had positive cultures for Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. The interval between cataract surgery and treatment ranged from 5 days to 6 months. Echography was beneficial in showing retained lens fragments in five of five patients when media opacities obscured the view of the fundus. Four patients had vitrectomy and removal of retained lens fragments during their initial treatment. The fifth patient was treated with intravitreal antibiotics alone and continued to have marked inflammation, eventually requiring vitrectomy for removal of the retained lens fragments. A final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in four of the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients may present with endophthalmitis in the setting of retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In such cases, the preferred initial management may be pars plana vitrectomy, removal of retained lens fragments, and injection of intraocular antibiotics. In eyes with endophthalmitis and opaque media, echography is a useful screening modality.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to orthopedic implant polymers.
AB  - The degradable polymers poly(orthoester) (POE), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA), and the nondegradable polymers polysulfone (PSF), polyethylene (PE), and poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) were exposed to cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. Bacteria washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) adhered to polymers in amounts nearly twice those of bacteria that were left in their growth medium, tryptic soy broth (TSB). In TSB, there was variation in adhesion from species to species, but no significant variation from polymer to polymer within one species. In PBS there were significant differences in the amounts of bacteria adhering to the various polymers with the exception, of S. epidermidis, which had similar adhesion to all polymers. As a whole, P. aeruginosa was the most adherent while S. epidermidis was the least adherent. The estimated values of the free energy of adhesion (delta Fadh) correlated with the amount of adherent P. aeruginosa. When POE, PLA, and PSF were exposed to hyaluronic acid (HA) before exposure to the bacteria, there was 50% more adhesion of E. coli and P. aeruginosa on POE and PLA. With respect to bacterial adhesion, the biodegradable polymers (POE and PLA) in general were not significantly different from the nondegradable polymers.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of EpiC, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, and sequence analysis of Staphylococcus epidermidis epiC mutants.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded epidermin biosynthetic gene epiC of Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu3298 was expressed in Escherichia coli by using the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system, and the gene product EpiC was identified by Western blotting (immunoblotting) with an anti-EpiC-peptide antiserum. EpiC was a hydrophobic but soluble protein. EpiC was purified by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. The determined amino-terminal amino acid sequence was M I N I N N I .... The electrophoretic migration behavior of EpiC depended on the oxidation state of the enzyme, indicating the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between C-274 and C-321. The cysteine residues in the motifs WC-274YG and C-321HG of EpiC are conserved in all lantibiotic enzymes of the C type (so-called LanC proteins) and in the CylM protein. Mutated epiC genes from S. epidermidis epiC mutants were cloned and expressed in E. coli. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutations occurred in the two motifs -S-X-X-X-G-X-X-G- and -N-X-G-X-A-H-G-X-X-G-, which are conserved in all LanC proteins. For the investigation of EpiC-EpiA interactions, precursor peptide EpiA was coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose High Performance Material (HiTrap). Under reducing conditions, EpiC was retarded on the EpiA-HiTrap column. In the incubation experiments, EpiC did not react with EpiA, with proepidermin, or with oxidative decarboxylated peptides.
TI  - Low-calcium peritoneal dialysis fluid should not impact peritonitis rates in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - It has been suggested that reducing the calcium content of peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) to 2.5 mEq/L decreases peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function and increases the incidence of peritonitis (especially Staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. We studied the uptake and killing of S epidermidis and Escherichia coli by PMOs and peripheral blood leukocytes incubated in control buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% gelatin [GHBSS]) and PDF containing varying concentrations of calcium (O to 3.5 mEq/L) and magnesium (O to 1.5 mEq/L) using ether diamine tetraacetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation, respectively. In addition, interleukin-1-beta-induced interleukin-6 production by human mesothelial cells was measured in the presence of concentrations of calcium increasing from 0 to 3.0 mmol/L. Fc receptor- mediated uptake of S epidermidis by PMO in the complete absence of Ca++ was comparable to that by PMO incubated in GHBSS with calcium. In contrast, the complement-dependent uptake of E coli was significantly lower in GHBSS devoid of Ca++ (46% +/- 5% v 24% +/- 3%; 0.05 < P < 0.02). No effect on intracellular killing of either microorganism by PMO was observed. The same held true for the phagocytic and killing capacity of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and monocytes obtained from healthy donors. Using Ca++ (2 to 3.5 mEq/L) and Mg++ (0.5 to 1.5 mEq/L) concentrations as applied in commercial PDFs, however, phagocytes performed as well as in control buffer. Interleukin-6 production by stimulated human mesothelial cells also required a small amount of Ca++ only, being normal above the 0.1 to 3 mmol/L Ca+ + range tested. Thus, complement- dependent uptake of bacteria by phagocytes is calcium dependent, whereas antibody-dependent uptake of S epidermidis is not. The concentrations of calcium in the current PDFs, however, will not compromise human mesothelial cells and leukocyte functions, and therefore should not impact the peritonitis rate.
TI  - Evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - An overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. This study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. After 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. A group of normal rats were used as controls. An overgrowth of Staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. These findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.
TI  - [Role of the ability of bacteria to inactivate natural anti-infective resistance  factors in their resistance to blood bactericidal action (blood serum)].
AB  
TI  - Bacterial changes in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Organisms routinely cultured from throat swabs and infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis were reviewed. During the last 12 years, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been replaced by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant isolates from throat swabs after admission. These change in the etiologic pattern of infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis, i.e., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, were in agreement with the organisms isolated from the throat swabs after admission. The S. aureus isolated from throat swabs after admission showed a decrease in the bacterial activity of cloxacillin, cephazolin and cefotaxime since 1978.
TI  - A four-year prospective study on microbial ecology of explanted prosthetic hips in 52 patients with "aseptic" prosthetic joint loosening.
AB  - The bacteriology of explanted prosthetic hips and surrounding soft tissue was studied in 52 patients undergoing surgical revision for joint loosening. In a prospective four-year study, positive bacterial cultures were recorded in 34 (76%) patients. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the predominant isolates, and 11 patients (33%) had more than three organisms isolated, 7 (20%) had two only, and 11 (33%) had one species. Among the 23 patients from whom specimens from all 11 predetermined anatomic sites were cultured, the highest frequency of positive cultures (52% and 47%) came from the shaft and capsular tissue, respectively. Organisms were less frequently recovered from the cement and acetabulum (13% and 4%, respectively). Using molecular typing in eight patients with paired isolates of the same species, clonal identity was found in four. An additional patient underwent a second revision for loosening 17 months after the first revision and the same clone of Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated on both occasions.
TI  - Engineering of a novel thioether bridge and role of modified residues in the lantibiotic Pep5.
AB  - Pep5 is a 34-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 5, that contains the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, which form three intramolecular ring structures. In addition, two didehydrobutyrines are present in the central part of the lantibiotic and an oxobutyryl residue is located at the N terminus. All rare amino acids are introduced by posttranslational modifications of a ribosomally made precursor peptide. To elucidate the function of the modified residues for the antimicrobial action of Pep5, mutant peptides, in which single modified residues had been eliminated, were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. All of these peptides showed a reduced antimicrobial activity. In addition, those peptides from which the ring structures had been deleted became susceptible to proteolytic digest. This demonstrates that the ring structures serve as stabilizers of conformations essential for activity, e.g., amphiphilicity, as well as for protecting Pep5 against proteases of the producing strains. In addition, residues that could serve as precursors of new modified amino acids in lantibiotics were introduced into the Pep5 precursor peptide. This way, a novel methyllanthionine and a didehydroalanine were inserted into the flexible central part of Pep5, demonstrating that biosynthesis of modified amino acids is feasible by protein engineering and use of the lantibiotic modification system.
TI  - Hepatic abscesses in dogs: 14 cases (1982-1994).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. RESULTS: Anorexia and lethargy were the most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. Hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. Serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. Abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. Thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. Hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. Concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. Seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. One dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. Six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). Five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. Ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. Medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.
TI  - Survival of nosocomial pathogenic bacteria at ambient temperature.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and many gram-negative rods are prevalent nosocomial pathogens. The mechanisms by which these organisms persist and spread within the hospital environment have not been clearly defined. We found that these bacteria have an extraordinary capability for survival in the environment. The viabilities of staphylococcal and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolates were assessed on three environmental surfaces: a non-nutrient surface, a woven cotton fiber, and a blood protein coagulum. The bacteria were dried on these surfaces and quantitatively subcultured over six months. The viability was consistently higher on dried blood surfaces. Viability was next highest on cotton strings. For both of these environments, staphylococci appeared to lose viability between three and six months, while E. coli and P. aeruginosa survived longer. Survival on a clean non-nutrient surface (tubes alone) for all organisms was much briefer and did not extend beyond four weeks. Such extended survival on blood and fiber surfaces, as observed in part, explains the difficulty in controlling colonization of patients by and spread of these nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. We examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (Alveofact, Survanta and Exosurf) approved for treatment of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on Legionella pneumophila serogroup I as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. Addition of Survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined E. coli strains. As opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the exception of Exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of group B streptococci. Though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.
TI  - [Antibioticograms of microorganisms isolated from foci of local infections in infants].
AB  - Microbiological tests were performed in regard to 474 newborns within 1985-1995.  It was shown that gram-positive microflora (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) predominated in the etiological structure of omphalitis and conjunctivitis. Among gram-negative isolates in the cases with omphalitis there predominated Klebsiella pneumonia. The antibioticograms were of great practical value for the adequate therapy.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Intracellular pathways involved in tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by human monocytes on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or staphylococcal peptidoglycan are partly similar.
AB  - This study compared the effects of intracellular pathway inhibitors on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release from human monocytes. Cells were stimulated with peptidoglycan (PG) from Staphylococcus epidermidis or with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both in the presence of 10% human serum. Of 10 substances tested, only the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 126 discriminated significantly between PG and LPS: TNF-alpha release induced by PG, but not by LPS, was dose-dependently suppressed. The results obtained with other modulatory substances, including different protein kinase and G protein inhibitors, suggest that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein tyrosine kinase, and a cholera-toxin-sensitive G protein are involved in both PG- and LPS-induced TNF-alpha release. Further, drugs such as pentoxifylline, chloroquine, and the antioxidant apocynin similarly inhibited TNF-alpha release by PG- as well as LPS-stimulated cells.
TI  - A study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  - Semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. The number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. Standard methods were used for the investigations. Five main genera of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all patients. They included, the Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including Prevotella bivia, P. disiens, P. melanogenica, P. asaccharolytica and B. fragilis. The predominant flora was P. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. The semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). Similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  - In modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. The host is not able to overcome this special type of opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. Antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. Bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. In this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. The antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) compared to catheters without silver. Similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.
TI  - Urinary tract infection at a specialist hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Midstream specimens of urine from inpatients and out patients at King Fahd Specialist Hospital in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia, were collected over a period of 12 months to determine prospectively the frequencies of different causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility. A total of 854 from 4157 specimens (20.54%) gave significant bacterial counts i.e., counts greater than 10(5) organisms per millilitre. Escherichia coli was the commonest organism (50.11%) followed by Klebsiella spp. (28.33%) Pseudomonas spp. (7.84%) and Proteus spp. (4.91%). Other bacterial pathogens were Enterococcus spp. (3.98%), Acinetobacter spp. (1.84%), Staphylococcus aureus (1.63%), Enterobacter spp. (0.35), Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.30%), Haemolytic streptococci B (0.47%) and Salmonella paratyphi A (0.12%). In vitro drug sensitivity tests showed norfloxacin and nalidixic acid to be very effective for most of the strains of the bacterial pathogens. A very high proportion of strains of Escherichia coli (86%) and Klebsiella spp. (94.6%) were found to be resistant to ampicillin.

TI  - High sensitivity of Mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  - Bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  Marked differences in sensitivity were observed. Based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and Escherichia coli the most resistant. In addition, two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. The high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.
TI  - Quantification of the ease of removal of bacteria from surfaces.
AB  - This paper describes a technique which reproducibly quantifies the ease of removal of microorganisms from surfaces. Tiles (22 mm x 22 mm) of various materials were colonised with Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 11047, Escherichia coli K12 HB101 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PaWH, by submersion, for various times (2 min-48 h), in inoculated Tryptone Soya broth (37 degrees C). Colonised tiles were blotted onto a Tryptone Soya agar plate for 1 min and the process was repeated through a succession of agar plates. The final plate contained tetrazolium salts (0.05% w/v) and was incubated in situ with the tile. Tetrazolium plates indicated that very few organisms remained on the tiles after 15 successive blots. In all instances, the number of recovered colonies per plate decreased exponentially with plate succession number, according to the relationship, CFU = A.10-kN, where CFU is the number of colonies transferred, k is the removal exponent, A is the intercept and N is the plate succession number. Removal exponents differed significantly between organisms (P > 0.95), depended on the nature of the test surface, and decreased as the inital attachment and colonisation time was increased from 2 min-48 h. Intercept values (A) but not the gradients were dependent upon the initial numbers of bacteria in suspension. These data indicate that the gradients derived from counting recoverable viable cells from successive blots of test tiles onto agar is a measure of the strength of attachment of the organisms to the surface.
TI  - Bacteraemia in a community and a university hospital.
AB  - Four hundred and forty-one and 1048 episodes of bacteraemia were prospectively surveyed over a period of 18 months in two hospitals, a 450 bed community hospital and a 900 bed tertiary care urban university hospital. Incidence of bacteraemia was 2.18 per 1000 hospitalization days (10.1 per 1000 admissions) in the community hospital and 2.64 per 1000 hospitalization days (12.0 per 1000 admissions (P < 0.004)) in the university hospital. Sixty six and 62% of episodes of bacteraemia were community acquired. The majority of bacteraemic episodes originated on the internal medicine wards of both hospital--46.7% and 58.7% respectively; the incidence of bacteraemia in the medical divisions of both hospitals was 23.1 and 17.5 per 1000 admissions respectively (P < 0.01). Overall mortality rates were 22% and 26.7% respectively. 39.9% and 44% of all isolates were Gram-positive pathogens. Escherichia coli was the commonest Gram-negative pathogen in both hospitals, particularly the community hospital--47.5% vs 32.8% (P < 0.005) of all Gram-negative pathogens, while Pseudomonas spp. were significantly more common in the university hospital--18.5% vs 11.8% (P < 0.02). Non-enterococcal streptococci were more common in the community hospital while enterococci were far more common at the university hospital--15.1% vs 1% of all Gram-positive pathogens (P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis was more common among the community hospital Gram-positive bacteraemias--31.1% vs 18.6% (P < 0.005). For almost all genera and species, antibiotic resistance was higher at the university hospital. Twenty nine point four per cent of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the university hospital were methicillin resistant compared to 2.4% at the community hospital (P < 0.005). 29.4% of all Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at the university hospital were penicillin resistant while no resistance was found at the community hospital. A high resistance rate to ofloxacin was found at the university hospital among S. aureus and Pseudomonas sp. Sources of bacteraemia did not differ significantly between the two hospitals. In conclusion, although outcome did not differ significantly for the two hospitals, there were significant differences between blood culture isolates in these two different settings. These differences may influence clinical decision-making about antibiotic therapy for patients in these hospitals.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel, plasmid-encoded trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase from Staphylococcus haemolyticus MUR313.
AB  - In recent years resistance to the antibacterial agent trimethoprim (Tmp) has become more widespread, and several trimethoprim-resistant (Tmpr) dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) have been described from gram-negative bacteria. In staphylococci, only one Tmpr DHFR has been described, the type S1 DHFR, which is encoded by the dfrA gene found on transposon Tn4003. In order to investigate the coincidence of high-level Tmp resistance and the presence of dfrA, we analyzed the DNAs from various Tmpr staphylococci for the presence of dfrA sequences by PCR with primers specific for the thyE-dfrA genes from Tn4003. We found that 30 or 33 isolates highly resistant to Tmp (MICs, > or = 512 micrograms/ml) contained dfrA sequences, whereas among the Tmpr (MICs, < or = 256 micrograms/ml) and Tmps isolates only the Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (both Tmpr and Tmps) seemed to contain the dfrA gene. Furthermore, we have cloned and characterized a novel, plasmid-encoded Tmpr DHFR from Staphylococcus haemolyticus MUR313. The dfrD gene of plasmid pABU17 is preceded by two putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences potentially allowing for the start of translation at two triplets separated by nine nucleotides. The predicted protein of 166 amino acids, designated S2DHFR, encoded by the longer open reading frame was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The molecular size of the recombinant S2DHFR was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry to be 19,821.2 +/- 2 Da, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 19,822 Da. In addition, the recombinant S2DHFR was shown to exhibit DHFR activity and to be highly resistant to Tmp.
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. DESIGN: A multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Animal research laboratory of a university medical center. SUBJECTS: One hundred sixty-five Balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. INTERVENTIONS: Nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms E. coli lipopolysaccharide O26:B6. One week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed E. coli/Bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. In parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three Gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. These effects were not seen with the Gram-positive cocci or with C. albicans. Pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal exposure to some Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. In the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. The presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: report of a series of 23 patients.
AB  - Vertebral osteomyelitis, an infectious disease with vague manifestations, can be  difficult to diagnose. Although vertebral osteomyelitis represents only 2-4% of bone infections, the consequences are often grave and disabling, even fatal, when untreated. A series of 23 cases is reported in which patient records were reviewed to determine the etiology and appropriateness of diagnosis and management. Information on treatment and follow-up after discharge was obtained from outpatient progress notes, records from subsequent hospital admissions, and telephone interviews of patients. Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive needle or open biopsy tissue cultures, positive blood cultures in the appropriate clinical setting, or diagnostic histopathology. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from 75% (15/20) of patient cultures, Escherichia coli from 15%, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from 10%. Overall, 87% (20/23) of these patients were disease-free at follow-up. The experience with this series of patients demonstrates that early diagnosis aided by MRI ensures a high cure rate and low complication rate.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Prospective study of plasma fibronectin in fulminant hepatitis: association with  infection and mortality.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Plasma fibronectin is an opsonic glycoprotein, normally synthesized by the liver, which decreases subsequent to severe liver damage and low levels of which may contribute to reticuloendothelial system dysfunction by compromising opsonic activity. This may result in an increased frequency of infection and death. The present study was conducted to evaluate the association of plasma fibronectin activity with infection and mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. METHODS: Plasma fibronectin was estimated serially in 69 consecutive patients with fulminant hepatic failure, nine patients with uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis and 32 normal volunteers. RESULTS: Plasma fibronectin levels in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (85.6 +/- 75.8 micrograms/ml) were significantly lower than in patients with uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis (295.5 +/- 88.5 micrograms/ml) and healthy volunteers (362.6 +/- 69.2 micrograms/ml). Forty-nine (72%) patients with fulminant hepatic failure died. The initial values of fibronectin in fulminant hepatic failure did not correlate with mortality. Patients with fulminant hepatic failure who survived showed a progressive rise in the fibronectin levels compared to the absence of an increase in fibronectin levels in the non-survivors. The mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure with infection (24/27) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to those without infection (25/42). Initial fibronectin levels in patients with infection (70.3 +/- 54.2 micrograms/ml) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in those without infection (92.3 +/- 64.4 micrograms/ml). We conclude that plasma fibronectin levels in patients with fulminant hepatic failure are decreased compared to healthy subjects and the absence of an increase in levels indicates a poor prognosis. Low levels of fibronectin are associated with an increased incidence of infection, which increases the mortality in these patients.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones DU-6859a and DV-7751a.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, DU-6859a and DV-7751a, was investigated against strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. DU-6859a and DV-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. Furthermore, DU-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill Ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. The bactericidal mechanisms of DV-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, DU-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both Str. pneumoniae and Ent. faecalis. This may explain the unusually potent bactericidal activity of this agent against these species. These results show that DU-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.
TI  - Multidrug resistance plasmid pSK108 from coagulase-negative staphylococci; relationships to Staphylococcus aureus qacC plasmids.
AB  - The 2.4-kb Staphylococcus epidermidis plasmid, pSK108, encodes a qacC multidrug resistance determinant. Sequence analysis has revealed that pSK108 is a member of the pC194 family of rolling circle replicating plasmids and suggests that the DNA segment containing qacC, which is bounded by the replication nick site and the minus origin palA, represents a resistance gene cassette that has undergone horizontal genetic exchange.
TI  - A randomised comparison of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of bacterial  infections in paediatric patients.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of isepamicin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or amikacin the same dosage regimen for the treatment of various infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients were compared in a prospective randomised trial. In total, 306 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of randomised treatment (204 isepamicin, 102 amikacin: intent-to-treat population); 181 patients satisfied all criteria for evaluability (120 isepamicin, 61 amikacin: efficacy population). Clinical cure or improvement rates in the isepamicin and amikacin groups were: intent-to-treat population, 188/204 (92%) and 94/102 (92%), respectively; efficacy population, 117/120 (98%) and 58/61 (95%), respectively. The bacteriological elimination rate (efficacy population) in the isepamicin and amikacin treatment groups was 75/76 (99%) vs 35/38 (92%). Nephrotoxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or > or = 44.2 mumol/L from baseline, occurred in 4/187 (2%) and 1/191 (1%) children treated with isepamicin and amikacin, respectively. Definite ototoxicity at the > or = 20 dB threshold occurred in 3 (1 isepamicin and 2 amikacin) out of 56 children evaluated with at least two audiograms. Thus isepamicin was as effective and as well tolerated as amikacin in the treatment of various infections in paediatric patients.
TI  - Subspecies discrimination of staphylococci from revision arthroplasties by ribotyping.
AB  - Sixty-six cultures of Staphylococcus spp. were obtained from bone and tissue samples collected from 37 patients during revision arthroplasties and were speciated and ribotyped to assess strain diversity in each species. There were 10 ribotypes among 51 isolates of S. epidermidis, three among three isolates of S. capitis, two among four isolates of S. aureus and two among two isolates of S. simulans. One ribotype was found among each of: two isolates of S. warneri; two isolates of S. haemolyticus and single isolates of S. cohnii and S. saprophyticus. Low molecular weight bands of ribotype patterns characterized one or two related species whereas high molecular weight bands were useful for distinguishing types within species. Specimens from 17 patients yielded more than one isolate of Staphylococcus spp. In 13 of these patients the isolates were representatives of a single species but in only eight did ribotyping show the isolates to be identical. The findings of multiple species and ribotypes from samples taken from the same patient may have implications for understanding the nature of infection in revision arthroplasty and for antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Low birth weight and nosocomial infection of neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - A one year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections (NI) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was performed. Among 229 neonates the infection rate was 27.1%, the infection proportion 20.1%, and the incidence density 21.9 infections per 1000 patient days. Infants were stratified into four birth weight categories. Degrees of infection ranged from 44.4% in the < or = 1000 g group to 10.1% in the > 2500 g group. Differences between the groups were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The mean birth weight of infants with NI was significantly lower than that of infants without NI (1711 g, SD +/- 841 g vs. 2213 g, SD +/- 896 g; P < 0.01). Mortality of < or = 1000 g babies was 44.4 and 7.6% in > 2500 g neonates. Major sites of infection were pneumonia (32.3%), blood-stream infections (27.4%), infections of the skin, and surgical site infections (11.3% each). The predominant pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (24.2%) whilst Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 22.7% of the total. Other major infective agents were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Group B streptococci. It is concluded, that low birth weight was a major risk factor for the acquisition of NI in the observed NICU population.
TI  - The high risk heart donor: potential pitfalls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of potentially infected donor hearts has been advocated to extend the supply of available hearts for transplantation. METHODS: To determine whether bacterial transmission from donor to recipient can occur with heart transplantation, we reviewed our experience with the 347 patients who received 360 heart transplants in the Utah Transplant Affiliated Hospitals from 1988 to 1993. RESULTS: During this time, nineteen donors had positive blood cultures before harvest. Sixteen donors had gram-positive bacteremia: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 9), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 2). Two donors had gram-negative bacteremia: serratia (n = 1) and acinetobacter (n = 1). One donor had blood cultures positive for both Escherichia coli and streptococcus. Infectious complications occurred in two of three recipients who received a heart from a donor with gram-negative bacteremia: Escherichia coli endocarditis, mediastinitis, sepsis and death in one, and serratia sepsis and mediastinitis in another. In each case the organisms and sensitivities were identical between donor and recipient. No infectious complications related to the donor heart occurred among the 16 recipients who received hearts from donors with gram-positive bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Bacterial transmission from donor heart to recipient can occur, (2) bacterial transmission appears to be more common with gram-negative organisms, and (3) infection of the recipient with a gram-negative organism from the donor heart is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
TI  - In vivo verification of in vitro model of antibiotic treatment of device-related  infection.
AB  - Device-related infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics alone. Standard susceptibility tests do not correlate with treatment success. Therefore, the utility of a pharmacokinetic in vitro model has been evaluated in comparison with the tissue-cage infection model in guinea pigs. The bactericidal activity of 28 treatment regimens has been studied by using three different test strains. In vitro efficacy was defined as reduction in the number of suspended or adherent bacteria, and in vivo efficacy was defined as reduction in the number of bacteria in tissue-cage fluid. Test results between the two models (in vivo and in vitro) correlated well, with correlation coefficients of 0.85 for in vivo efficacy versus in vitro efficacy against suspended bacteria and 0.72 for in vivo efficacy versus in vitro efficacy against adherent bacteria (P < 0.05) for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.96 and 0.82 (P < 0.05) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.89 and 0.97 for Escherichia coli, respectively. In contrast, standard susceptibility tests, ratios of MICs to trough or peak levels, ratios of the area under the curve to the MIC, or time above the MIC were not predictive for therapeutic outcome in either the in vitro or in vivo model. In both models, the bactericidal activity levels with combination regimens were significantly higher than those with single-drug regimens (P < 0.001). Furthermore, rifampin combinations with either vancomycin, teicoplanin, fleroxacin, or ciprofloxacin were significantly more bactericidal against adherent bacteria than netilmicin combinations with vancomycin or daptomycin (P < 0.01). Thus, in vivo verification of the pharmacokinetic in vitro model correlated well with the animal model. The in vitro model offers an alternative to ther animal model in experiments that screen and assess antibiotic regimens against device-related infections.
TI  - Cefotaxime for treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs and symptoms, and bacteremia during the first month of life. The incidence is relatively low (one to eight cases/1000 live births), yet the risk of mortality is approximately 25%. Meningitis in the neonate is usually a sequela of bacteremia; however, it is discussed with neonatal sepsis, because they commonly share etiology and pathogenesis. The incidence of meningitis is usually a fraction of the number of infants with sepsis, varying in different settings from one-fourth to one-third. The mortality rate is high, varying in some series from 15%-50%. There are two major forms of presentation of neonatal sepsis. Early-onset disease presents as a fulminant, multisystemic illness during the first 5-7 days of life; late-onset disease is more commonly recognized after the first weeks of life. Because different microorganisms are responsible for the two forms of disease, the choice of antimicrobial agents also differs. Some organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Listeria monocytogenes may be responsible, whereas other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are usually associated with late-onset disease. Classic initial (empiric) treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis consists of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. With the advent of the third-generation cephalosporins, however, the empiric antimicrobial approach for neonatal sepsis and meningitis has changed in most centers. Third-generation cephalosporins cover more of the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis and meningitis, except for the enterococci and L. monocytogenes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteria in surface infections of neonates.
AB  - A bacteriological work on surface infections was done among live births (study group I) and neonates admitted in hospital (study group II). Out of 134 cases of conjunctivitis in group I Gram-negative bacilli predominated (48.5%) with Escherichia coli accounting for 29 (14.9%) cases, Klebsiella species 15 (11.2%) cases, Citrobacter freundii 3 (2.2%) cases, Pseudomons aeruginosa 18 (13.4%) cases and Aeromonas hydrophila 3 (2.2%) amongst pure isolates (73.9%). Gonococcus was noted in 2 (1.5%) cases. In group II, 41.7% were Staphylococcus aureus in pure growth (75%), compared to only 9.0% in group I. Skin infections were caused by both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the principal insolates from umbilical sepsis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated as pure growth from local site of noma neonatorum. Anaerobic cultures were negative in all except in 2 cases of umbilical sepsis with tetanus neonatorum revealing Clostridium tetani which however proved to be non-toxigenic. Blood cultures were positive in 4 out of 14 cases bearing 50% correlation with bacteria from surface infections. A source study established partial correlation with the cases of pseudomonas conjunctivitis. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus and biochemical typing failed to detect any definite marker of clinical entities, except that the skin infections were caused by group III phages predominantly (65.0%).
TI  - Comparison of bacteria growth in single and pooled platelet concentrates after deliberate inoculation and storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to store pools of platelet concentrates (PCs) for extended periods would provide logistical flexibility. However, reports of severe adverse reactions due to the transfusion of contaminated PCs led to an examination of whether the total bacteria levels after storage of pools containing a deliberately inoculated platelet unit would be significantly different than the levels in paired unpooled concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single PC was deliberately inoculated on Day 0 with one of three bacterial species (0.1-8.0 colony-forming units/mL). On Day 1, the deliberately inoculated PC was divided into three equal parts and either 1) pooled with 5 half-volume, ABO- and Rh-identical PCs; 2) similarly pooled and white cell reduced; or 3) kept as a control. Sterile connections were used during pooling; modified storage containers were used to ensure the correct surface-to-volume ratio of the single unit. RESULTS: Between Day 2 and Day 5 of storage, in 26 of 36 paired samples, nonfiltered pools containing Escherichia coli had greater total numbers of bacteria than did the paired single PCs. Day 2 pools had total bacteria levels approximately five times higher (colony-forming units/mL x container volume) than those in single units (p < 0.05). There was rapid growth of Staphylococcus aureus by Day 2 in pooled and unpooled PCs; by Day 3, total bacteria levels were approximately five times higher in pools than in single units (p < 0.05). Between Days 3 and 5 of storage, in 23 of 27 paired samples, nonfiltered pools containing S. aureus had greater total bacteria levels than the single PCs. By Day 5, 15 of 16 non-white-cell reduced pools had total levels of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria approximately five times those in the paired single PCs. Greater total bacteria levels in pooled units than in single units generally occurred when bacteria in pools reached the stationary phase of growth (when bacteria concentration became constant), and they were well correlated with the sixfold volume of pooled units. White cell reduction did not substantially affect the time required to attain stationary phase. CONCLUSION: The potential during storage for greater total bacteria levels in pools than in single PCs is a consequence of the greater volume of the pool.
TI  - Use of ribotyping to investigate tracheal colonisation by Staphylococcus epidermidis as a source of bacteremia in ventilated newborns.
AB  - Ribotyping was used to determine whether a relationship exists between endotracheal tube colonisation with Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteremia with this organism. Over a three-week period, four mechanically ventilated preterm babies presented with five episodes of infection and bacteremia. For each blood specimen obtained for culture a tracheal aspirate sample was collected at the same time by suctioning. After DNA extraction and cleavage by EcoRI, hybridisation was performed with a digoxigenin-labelled 16S-rDNA probe from Escherichia coli. Five different band patterns were recognised on the membrane. In two children the same band pattern was found in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from both blood and tracheal aspirate. Ribotyping thus could be used to differentiate a series of infections from an outbreak and showed that a relationship may exist between tracheal colonisation and bacteremia in mechanically ventilated newborns.
TI  - Development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. Prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  - Wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. Over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. Seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. Seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. Forty of 63 (64%) infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. Only 7 of 42 (17%) noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only S aureus, S epidermidis and Corynebacterium species isolated. Ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. Rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. Emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. Therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.
TI  - Antibiotic killing of bacteria: comparison of bacteria on surfaces and in liquid, growing and nongrowing.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for bacterial pathogens are  derived from broth suspensions (broth dilution) and from nutrient surfaces (agar dilution). These concentrations may not apply when bacteria are on a nonnutrient surface such as in a foreign body infection. We compared bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) broth suspension MBCs with MBCs of the same bacteria when on a nonnutrient surface in broth the growing and nongrowing phases. Bacteria growing on cotton surfaces were much less susceptible to antibiotic killing than when freely suspended in the liquid nutrient. These results alone, independent of host factors, would explain the failure of antibiotics to eradicate infections involving bacteria on foreign body surfaces. The resistance of bacteria to antibiotic killing is not caused by a lack of antibiotic penetration to the site of the bacteria, but by an altered state of the bacteria when they are associated with a surface.
TI  - Biological activities of a Turkish medicinal plant, Prangos platychlaena.
AB  - Prangos platychlaena has been used in traditional medicine in eastern Turkey. It  stops bleeding and heals the scars when applied externally. When the isolated coumarins were tested against bacterial strains, only a slight activity was obtained.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.

TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.

TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - The leucocyte protein L1 (calprotectin): a putative nonspecific defence factor at epithelial surfaces.
AB  - The L1 protein occurs at high concentrations in neutrophils, monocytes, certain reactive tissue macrophages, squamous mucosal epithelia, and reactive epidermis. It constitutes in fact about 60% of the neutrophilic cytosol protein fraction. The two L1 chains (L1H and L1L) are referred to by a bewildering collection of names, various authors having different preferences (MRP-8 and MRP-14; CFA or calgranulin A and B). The most recent proposal is calprotectin because of its calcium-binding properties and antimicrobial effect shown in vitro. L1 belongs to the S-100 protein family and may be involved in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. It exists at high levels in blood and interstitial tissue fluid in several infectious, inflammatory, and malignant disorders, and it is released abundantly in foci of granulocytes and macrophages. The C-terminal sequence of the L1H chain has been shown to be identical to the N-terminus of peptides known as neutrophil immobilizing factors. Such an activity of L1 could be important for the accumulation of vital granulocytes, while L1 released from neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells might exert antimicrobial activity, perhaps by depriving microorganisms of zinc. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of L1 in vitro were found to be 4-32 mg/l for Candida albicans, 64 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus, 64-256 mg/l for S. epidermidis, and 256 mg/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Killing was observed at 2-4 times higher concentrations. In patients with HIV infection, those who developed oral candidiasis had significantly lower parotid L1 levels than those who did not (67 micrograms/l vs. 216 micrograms/l).
TI  - Effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. The effects of growing Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. Growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the pH-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different SDS-PAGE protein profiles. For several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. The important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - Intravenous immune globulin prophylaxis of late-onset sepsis in premature neonates.
AB  - To determine whether a single dose of intravenously administered immune globulin  (IVIG) decreases late-onset sepsis in premature infants, we prospectively entered 753 neonates with birth weight 500 to 2000 gm, gestation < or = 34 weeks, and age < or = 12 hours into a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. Infants were randomly selected to receive a single intravenous infusion, 10 ml/kg, of either IVIG (500 mg/kg) or albumin (5 mg/kg) and were observed for 8 weeks for infection. Maternal and neonatal risk factors for infection did not differ between groups. Although serum IgG values before infusion were related to gestation (R = 0.62), the change in serum IgG or half-life of IgG after IVIG infusion was not (R < or = 0.09). The serum IgG concentration was increased (p < 0.05) in IVIG-treated patients for 8 weeks. There were 88 episodes of late-onset sepsis in 79 neonates (10.5%). Causative organisms included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (37 episodes), Enterococcus (9), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Candida (6), Escherichia coli (6), and multiple organisms (11). Sepsis, death, and death as a result of infection were unaffected by treatment. We conclude that a single infusion of IVIG, 500 mg/kg, shortly after birth was not effective prophylaxis for late-onset infection in premature neonates. Future studies of late-onset sepsis prophylaxis should consider IVIG with known pathogen-specific antibody concentrations against organisms causing these infections, in particular S. epidermidis.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Differential effects of chlorination of bacteria on their capacity to generate NO, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in macrophages.
AB  - Activated rodent macrophages produce high amounts of nitric oxide (NO). NO as a tumoricidal and defence molecule against intracellular parasites is commonly accepted. However, its role as an obligatory killing factor for extracellular bacteria is controversial. In the present study we stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages by heat-killed bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Escherichia coli). In some groups bacteria were pretreated with HOCl, to replace the chlorinating system in activated neutrophils that operates as a bactericidal system in vivo. High levels of NO, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected after stimulation by all non-chlorinated bacteria strains tested. However, after chlorination Gram-positive bacteria lost their ability to induce NO and TNF-alpha, whereas phagocytosis and IL-6 production were not affected by chlorination.
TI  - Construction of an expression system for engineering of the lantibiotic Pep5.
AB  - Pep5 is a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide which is produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 5. Its structural gene, pepA, is located on the 20-kb plasmid pED503. A 6.2-kb fragment of pED503 containing pepA, the immunity gene pepI, and 5.4 kb of downstream sequence was able to direct biosynthesis of biologically active Pep5 in a nonproducing variant of the producer strain which is devoid of pED503. In addition to producing wild-type Pep5 with a molecular mass of 3,488 Da, the clone produced a peptide with an eightfold-lower bactericidal activity and a mass of 3,506 Da, indicative of incomplete dehydration of one hydroxyamino acid. For construction of the expression system, this 6.2-kb fragment was cut into a 1.39-kb fragment containing pepA and pepI and a 4.8-kb fragment covering the remaining downstream region. This 4.8-kb fragment was directly cloned into an Escherichia coli-Staphylococcus shuttle vector, yielding a new plasmid (pGB9) into which mutated pepA genes generated on the 1.39-kb fragment can be reinserted to yield a functional Pep5 biosynthesis gene cluster. To test the expression system, two mutants were constructed. Lys-18-Pro Pep5 was produced in its dehydrated form and a partially hydrated form in amounts comparable to those of the wild-type peptide. In contrast, only small amounts of Phe-23-Asp Pep5 were excreted, indicating that some residues in the propeptide part of the prelantibiotic may be crucial for certain steps in the biosynthetic pathway of lantibiotics.
TI  - Differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  - The short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. In addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. The results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. On the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. Escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while Aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. This different order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. Thus, the low digestion rates of Ent. faecalis and Staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric Gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.
TI  - Ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of gentamicin upon planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was measured with and without application of 67-kHz ultrasonic stimulation. The ultrasound was applied at levels that had no inhibitory or bactericidal activity against the bacteria. Measurements of the MIC and bactericidal activity of gentamicin against planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa and E. coli demonstrated that simultaneous application of 67-kHz ultrasound enhanced the effectiveness of the antibiotic. A synergistic effect was observed and bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when gentamicin concentrations and ultrasonic levels which by themselves did not reduce viability were combined. As the age of the culture increased, the bacteria became more resistant to the effect of the antibiotic alone. Application of ultrasound appeared to reverse this resistance. The ultrasonic treatment-enhanced activity was evident with cultures of P. aeruginosa and E. coli but was not observed with cultures of gram-positive S. epidermidis and S. aureus. These results may have application in the treatment of bacterial biofilm infections on implant devices, which infections are usually more resistant to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of genetic variation on induced neutrophilia in mice.
AB  - Mice from a variety of strains were injected with a sterile irritant (Brewer's thioglycolate) and killed bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Escherichia coli) to determine their effect on accumulation of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity. Peak accumulation occurred around 15 h postinjection and showed significant strain-related variation. C57BL/10 mice were identified as having a high-responder phenotype and BALB/c mice a low-responder phenotype. Inheritance of the high-responder phenotype followed simple Mendelian genetics: (BALB/c x C57BL/10)F1 mice were found to be more responsive than either parental phenotype. Major histocompatibility complex H-2d haplotype was found to convey an augmented neutrophil response in conjunction with B10 background high-responder genes (B10.D2/n) but the H-2d haplotype per se was not the only factor in determining high responsiveness. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria appeared to activate different immune mechanisms. Both gram-negative bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced a response similar to, but less potent than, that induced by Brewer's thioglycollate. Neutralization of the LPS content of Brewer's thioglycolate abrogated the response.
TI  - Staphylococcal glycocalyx activates macrophage prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 1 production and modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide production.
AB  - We have examined the effect of staphylococcal glycocalyces on the ability of murine peritoneal macrophages to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and to generate nitric oxide. Glycocalyx partially purified under endotoxin-free conditions from defined liquid medium cultures of Staphylococcus lugdunensis or Staphylococcus epidermidis was a strong stimulator of PGE2 and IL-1 production. The addition of 10 to 100 micrograms of glycocalyx per ml induced levels of IL-1 and PGE2 production similar to that induced by 0.1 to 1 micrograms of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) per ml. In contrast, glycocalyx induced ninefold less TNF-alpha and three- to fourfold less nitrite than LPS. A modulatory effect was suggested by the observation that the amount of TNF-alpha and nitrite generated remained constant whether the macrophages were stimulated with 10 or 100 micrograms of glycocalyx per ml. A selective modulation of macrophage activation was confirmed by the demonstration that costimulation of macrophages with both glycocalyx and LPS resulted in a reduction in TNF-alpha and nitrite generation relative to stimulation with LPS alone even though costimulation had no effect on PGE2 production and increased IL-1 production. Involvement of PGE2 in this modulatory effect was suggested by the ability of indomethacin to augment glycocalyx-stimulated TNF-alpha production and to reverse the inhibitory effect of glycocalyx on LPS induction of TNF-alpha production. However, the inability of indomethacin to reverse the inhibitory effect of glycocalyx on LPS-induced nitric oxide generation suggests that the selective modulation of macrophage function by glycocalyx may be more complex than increased sensitivity to PGE2 feedback inhibition.
TI  - [Variations in the antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial strains after contact with the metals used for the construction of prosthetic implants].
AB  - The antibiotic sensitivity of 19 Gram-positive bacterial strains (11 Staphylococcus aureus and 8 Staphylococcus epidermidis) and 16 Gram-negative strains (8 Escherichia coli and 8 Proteus species) was evaluated after contact with stainless steel and with some metals compounding the alloys used for prosthetic devices. The hypothesis was that the resistance to antibiotic therapy of infections associated with prosthetic implants is also due to a modification in the sensitivity of microorganisms. The results, compared to those obtained from control tests, showed only slight variations in the antibiotic sensitivity of the strains put in contact with the metals. In Gram-positive strains, after contact with metals, the increase in sensitivity occurred more frequently than the reduction. In Gram-negative strains, the decrease in sensitivity was more frequent than the increase. Proteus strains showed sensitivity variations more frequently than Escherichia coli strains. Titanium and nickel induced the highest number of variations, both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Rapid estimation of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility with flow cytometry.
AB  - Bacterial antibiotic susceptibility was rapidly estimated for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp. by flow cytometry. This was achieved by measuring the uptake of a negatively charged membrane potential sensitive dye bis-(1,3-dibutyl-barbituric acid) trimethine oxonol and observing changes in low-angle light scatter (excitation light scattered by up to 15 degrees). Estimations of ampicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin susceptibilities were possible within 2-5 h from a plate culture, depending on the species and antibiotic used. This includes the time necessary to establish steady-state growth in liquid culture.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - Producer immunity towards the lantibiotic Pep5: identification of the immunity gene pepI and localization and functional analysis of its gene product.
AB  - The lantibiotic Pep5 is produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 5. Pep5 production and producer immunity are associated with the 20-kb plasmid pED503. A 1.3-kb KpnI fragment of pED503, containing the Pep5 structural gene pepA, was subcloned into the Escherichia coli-Staphylococcus shuttle vector pCU1, and the recombinant plasmid pMR2 was transferred to the Pep5- and immunity-negative mutant S. epidermidis 5 Pep5- (devoid of pED503). This clone did not produce active Pep5 but showed the same degree of insensitivity towards Pep5 as did the wild-type strain. Sequencing of the 1.3-kb KpnI-fragment and analysis of mutants demonstrated the involvement of two genes in Pep5 immunity, the structural gene pepA itself and pepI, a short open reading frame upstream of pepA. To identify the 69-amino-acid pepI gene product, we constructed an E. coli maltose-binding protein-PepI fusion clone. The immunity peptide PepI was detected in the soluble and membrane fractions of the wild-type strain and the immune mutants (harboring the plasmids pMR2 and pMR11) by immunoblotting with anti-maltose-binding protein-PepI antiserum. Strains harboring either pepI without pepA or pepI with incomplete pepA were not immune and did not produce PepI. Washing the membrane with salts and EDTA reduced the amount of PepI in this fraction, and treatment with Triton X-100 almost completely removed the peptide. Furthermore, PepI was hydrolyzed by proteases added to osmotically stabilized protoplasts. This suggests that PepI is loosely attached to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Proline uptake and efflux experiments with immune and nonimmune strains also indicated that PepI may act at the membrane site.
TI  - Endemic necrotizing enterocolitis: lack of association with a specific infectious agent.
AB  - We conducted a comprehensive analysis of bacterial, parasitic and viral agents present in stool samples of 23 necrotizing enterocolitis cases and 23 matched and 10 random controls. Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli were the most common aerobic bacterial species isolated. Astrovirus was identified in a stool sample from one control. Eight infants were bacteremic; in 7 of 8 the same organism was also present in the stool. No one bacterial species or strain (as identified by plasmid profile analysis) was associated with occurrence of illness. Plasmid analysis further suggested that each infant was colonized with his or her own distinctive aerobic bacterial flora. With the exception of isolates from two control patients which hybridized with a probe for diffuse adherence, no diarrheagenic E. coli was identified. Five (45%) of 11 case infants were colonized with coagulase-negative staphylococci (all S. epidermidis) that produced delta-hemolysin in vitro, as compared with 13 (87%) of 15 control infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis was not associated with an increased ability to ferment carbohydrate, as measured by in vitro beta-galactosidase activity. Our data do not support the hypothesis that endemic necrotizing enterocolitis in our institution is caused by a single infectious agent, nor was there evidence that previously proposed virulence mechanisms such as production of delta-hemolysin or increased in vitro carbohydrate fermentation play a critical role in disease occurrence.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The biological significance of the anticomplement activity of bacteria].
AB  - The occurrence and the average levels of anticomplementary activity among the representatives of bacterial species as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, mainly reflecting differences between their ecovariants, were established. In connection with the fact that some of E. coli uropathogenic strains with high anticomplementary activity were found to be capable of inhibiting the activity of C5 in a hemolytic system and with the presence of correlation between the property under study and complement resistance, the existence of common mechanisms for the realization of these properties was supposed. Extracellular products of S. aureus were shown to be capable of inhibiting the functional activity and opsonic action of C3 component of the complement, which was related to the presence of anticomplementary activity in these bacteria. Experimental staphylococcal infection in mice revealed the predominant accumulation of bacteria possessing this property. Clinico-bacteriological studies demonstrated that the anticomplementary activity of E. coli contributed to the increased risk of postoperative complications in cholecystitis and to the prolongation of bacteriuria in chronic pyelonephritis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of Bridelia ferruginea (Euphorbiaceae).
AB  - Water and ethanol extracts of Bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. The extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella sp. The zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. Sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. The Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the Gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility of a silver-coated central venous catheter.
AB  - Central venous catheter infection presents an important problem in modern medicine, leading sometimes to a life-threatening situation for the patient as well as contributing to prolonged hospital stay and to an increase in costs. We have evaluated the in vitro biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of a silver-coated polyurethane catheter designed for use as a colonization-resistant, antiinfective catheter. Due to a comparatively low silver release, the catheter performed well in cell toxicity and blood compatibility tests as well as in acute toxicity tests done with mice. The antimicrobial activity was tested in stationary and dynamic bacterial adherence experiments using S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa as test strains. The silver-coated polyurethane catheter showed good ability to prevent microbial colonization of the catheter surface. Currently a clinical trial of the silver-coated catheter is under investigation.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Development of bacterial biofilms on silastic catheter materials in peritoneal dialysis fluid.
AB  - A modified Robbins' device was used to monitor the growth of bacteria associated  with clinical peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis fluid. To simulate bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on peritoneal catheters, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli were allowed to adhere to silastic disks and were then grown in fresh or used dialysis fluid. Adherent bacteria formed microcolonies and biofilms on silastics within 4 to 24 hours. Our data showed that colonization of the silastic disks was related to the quantity of bacteria and there were significant differences between the growth of adherent bacteria in fresh and used dialysis fluid. Adherent S epidermidis and P aeruginosa grew better in dialysis fluids than adherent E coli. These results suggest that S epidermidis and P aeruginosa are more likely to colonize silastic catheters and to cause catheter-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients than E coli.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - Antibacterial activity, antibiotic retention, and infection resistance of a rifampin-impregnated gelatin-sealed Dacron graft.
AB  - PURPOSE: A gelatin-sealed porous Dacron graft impregnated with rifampin was evaluated in a two-part study of its use in preventing prosthetic infection. METHODS: The graft was impregnated by soaking it for 15 minutes in rifampin (1 mg/ml). In part 1 its antibacterial activity and rifampin retention over time were determined. Infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in pigs, and the rifampin concentration of the graft, serum, and perigraft space was assayed up to 96 hours after surgery. In part 2, infection resistance was tested in pigs in which the retroperitoneum was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus after graft replacement. The postoperative infection rate was compared in three groups: pigs given gelatin-sealed grafts without rifampin (controls), pigs receiving nonimpregnated grafts and intravenous rifampin (15 mg/kg) for 3 days after surgery, and those given the rifampin grafts. RESULTS: Rifampin was present in the grafts for up to 72 hours after surgery and in the perigraft fluid for 24 hours but was never detected in the serum. The grafts had inhibitory activity in vitro against S. aureus and the biofilm phase of Staphylococcus epidermidis for up to 3 days and against Escherichia coli for 2 days. Pigs given intravenous rifampin had a significantly lower infection rate than had control pigs (7/12 vs 13/13; p = 0.02); those receiving the rifampin graft had a lower rate (2/13) than had either the control pigs (p < 0.001) or those given intravenous rifampin (p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This simple method of graft impregnation resulted in antibiotic retention for 3 days and appeared to be superior to intravenous antibiotic administration in preventing perioperative graft infection.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of a siderophore. 3. The activity of deferoxamine in vitro and its influence on the effect of antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of deferoxamine (DFO) both per se and in combination with the reductant ascorbic acid (AA) was determined against 10 E. coli strains, 5 P. mirabilis strains, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. In terms of interaction, the influence of DFO on the activities of cephalothin and gentamicin was furthermore investigated against the same panel of strains employing a macrobroth dilution technique and killing-curve kinetics. The MICs of cephalothin and gentamicin were lowered for one half of the strains. Moreover, DFO prolonged the generation times of logarithmic growth phase considerably, especially when the reductant AA was present. The interactions between DFO or DFO+AA and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were established by the application of growth constants, and resulted in synergy for 15 out of 25 strains with cephalothin and 9 out of 25 strains with gentamicin.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - Physical map location of the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase gene on the Escherichia coli chromosome.
AB  
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial labdane-type diterpenes from the aerial parts of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus.
AB  - Seven labdane-type diterpenoids were isolated from the leaves of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus; their structures were established by spectroscopic means. All compounds were tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity against three cell line systems: KB, P-388; and NSCLC-N6. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans as well.
TI  - [Statistic studies on bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (report 6:  isolation rate and drug sensitivity from 1988 through 1989)].
AB  - We examined the bacteria isolated from urine of patients in our department from 1988 though 1989. A total of 809 strains were isolated from the outpatients. They were 241 strains of gram-positive bacteria (29.8%). E. coli (32.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by Enterococcus spp. (9.9%), Proteus group (7.4%), S. epidermidis (6.2%), P. aeruginosa (5.1%) and others. A total of 412 strains were isolated from the inpatients. They consisted of 173 strains of gram-positive bacteria (42.0%). Enterococcus spp. (17.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by P. aeruginosa (12.6%), S. epidermidis (9.7%), E. coli (7.3%), S. aureus (6.6%) and others. Fewer P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens and Proteus group were isolated from the outpatients and fewer S. marcescens, E. coli and K. pneumoniae from inpatients than previously. More S. aureus were isolated abruptly from the inpatients and more E. coli were isolated from the outpatients than previously. E. cloacae, S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Corynebacterium spp. all isolated from inpatients showed lower antimicrobial sensitivity than those isolated from the outpatients.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  - Viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. Controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. Rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Micrococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were not affected. The factor mediating the bactericidal effect survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 1 hour. The bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 3 hours. The antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.
TI  - Differential binding capacity and internalisation of bacterial substrates as factors in growth rate of Acanthamoeba spp.
AB  - Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living predators that selectively feed on bacteria. Adherence of the bacterial food source to the trophozoite membrane is followed by internalisation and digestion. Through co-cultivation of A. castellanii and A. polyphaga, individually, with Xanthomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (despite the amoebicidal properties of the latter organism), specificity with regard to the preferred bacterial substrate was judged. X. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa adhered almost immediately forming a multilayered mantle of bacilli around trophozoites of both species of amoebae. E. coli adhered to fewer trophozoites and in smaller numbers. X. maltophilia was readily internalised after co-cultivation for 8 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. epidermidis were not internalised even after co-cultivation for 24 h. These data suggest that the suitability of a bacterial food source for the Acanthamoeba spp. studied is associated not only with the proclivity with which the bacterial species binds to the trophozoite surface, but also with the rate of its internalisation.
TI  - Antibacterial peritoneal defence in automated peritoneal dialysis: advantages of  tidal over continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis?
AB  - In tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) only a part of the infused dialysate is drained with each exchange, leaving a residual volume on top of which fresh fluid is cycled. As the persistent presence of a buffered intraperitoneal reserve volume might favour peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function, PMO obtained from eight patients during a 3-h continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) or TPD session were studied in a randomized cross-over trial. PMO were studied for uptake of E. coli (complement-dependent) and S. epidermidis (antibody-dependent), as well as for their killing capacity and peak chemiluminescence response. In addition, dialysate was sampled during both treatment sessions and studied for pH, osmolality, and effect on the viability of donor phagocytes and mesothelial cells. TPD-derived PMO were significantly better able to phagocytose E. coli than CCPD-PMO (48 +/- 8 versus 33 +/- 6% uptake, P < 0.05), whereas the other tested functional capacities revealed no significant difference between TPD- and CCPD-PMO. During TPD dialysate pH ranged from 6 to 7 as compared to a pH range from 5 to 7 in CCPD. The presence of a residual dialysate volume resulted in less wash-out of cells and opsonins early in the treatment, and to some extent blunted the noxious effects of fresh dialysis solutions. Overall, however, tidal PD appeared to have no advantage over CCPD regarding preservation of peritoneal defences.
TI  - Palacos gentamicin for the treatment of deep periprosthetic hip infections.
AB  - Between 1983 and 1986, 40 hip arthroplasties in 40 patients with documented deep  infection were reimplanted using Palacos Gentamicin at The Hospital for Special Surgery. Palacos Gentamicin was added to the standard protocol, which included removal of the prosthesis, cement, if present, and a thorough debridement of infected and necrotic tissue, six weeks of intravenous antibiotics with a postpeak serum bactericidal titer of at least 1:8 against the infecting bacteria, followed by reimplantation of the hip. Sixteen of the patients also had the placement of gentamicin-impregnated beads at the time of prosthetic removal. All patients had a deep periprosthetic infection, 13 with Staphylococcus epidermidis, seven Staphylococcus aureus, four Streptococcus, three Enterococcus, three with gram-positive bacteria, four Escherichia coli, two Proteus, one Pseudomonas, and three anaerobic organisms. At an average follow-up period of five years (range, two to ten), two of the 40 hips (5%) developed recurrent infection. These cases recurred at one month in a patient immunocompromised by end-stage systemic lupus erythematosus (S. epidermidis) and at five months in a patient with severe titanium metallosis (S. aureus). No recurrence was noted in eight cases with gram-negative organisms or in three cases of mixed infections. No infection recurred after five months in the remaining patients before their death or last follow-up examination. Of the remaining 38 hips, 16 died of causes unrelated to the hip, leaving 21 with an average follow-up period of 7.5 years. Clinical results in these patients were 14 excellent, five good, two fair, and no poor results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - New biomaterials through surface segregation phenomenon: new quaternary ammonium  compounds as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Five new trisiloxane quaternary ammonium compounds were synthesized from hydrotrisiloxane with allyl glycidyl ether to yield the epoxy function. Various amines were then reacted to yield trisiloxane amines which were further reacted to methyl substitute or oxidize the beta-carbons in order to provide thermal stability. These new compounds were employed as melt additives in a nonwoven polypropylene fiber extrusion process to produce, through surface segregation, a new biomaterial with antibacterial properties.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - In-vitro biocompatibility of alternative CAPD fluids; comparison of bicarbonate-buffered and glucose-polymer-based solutions.
AB  - Evidence is accumulating that conventional dialysis fluids for CAPD are incompatible with peritoneal host defence. We therefore investigated the effect of alternative CAPD fluids on mononuclear leukocyte (PBMC) viability and cytokine production in vitro. Fluids tested were bicarbonate-buffered solutions containing 1.5% or 4.25% glucose, 7.5% glucose polymer dialysis fluid (GPDF), and conventional 1.5% glucose fluid (G1.5%). PBMC were stimulated (2 h, 37 degrees C) in the different test fluids with a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The cytokines TNF alpha and IL-6 in PBMC supernatants were measured by specific enzyme immunoassays. Induction of cytokine messenger RNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Conventional G1.5% (pH 5.5) inhibited cytokine release from activated PBMC by > 95%, whereas cell responses in low-glucose bicarbonate fluid were not significantly reduced. In contrast, high-glucose bicarbonate fluid exerted > 80% inhibition despite its neutral pH. GPDF was inhibitory at its initial low pH, whereas cytokine release was restored following pH neutralization. Cytokine mRNA expression was suppressed by conventional G1.5% fluid and by high-glucose bicarbonate fluid. These data indicate that pH neutralization leads to a substantial improvement of dialysis fluid biocompatibility; however, hyperosmolality and/or high glucose content inhibit cell responsiveness even at normal pH. Replacement of glucose by glucose polymer might prove beneficial provided that the initial low pH is neutralized.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - Immune response in patients with intra-abdominal infections treated with carbapenems.
AB  - The immune responses against isolated microorganisms in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin were investigated. Fifty-nine patients received meropenem 500 mg t.i.d. intravenously for 3-21 days (mean 5.4 days) and 50 patients imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg/500 mg t.i.d. intravenously for 3-17 days (mean 5.1 days). Three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second sample between three and seven days after start of antibiotic treatment, and the third sample between 14 and 28 days later. Ninety-eight per cent of the patients in the meropenem group and 95% of the patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group were cured. There was no difference in the clinical outcome between the two treatment groups. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group, anaerobic cocci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella spp. predominated among the isolated microorganisms. Thirty-nine patients in the meropenem group had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms while 31 patients in the imipenem/group had significant responses. E. coli and B. fragilis gave rise in antibody titres in most patients indicating that these species are the most important pathogens in intraabdominal infections.
TI  - [Opsonizing activity of human immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (IVIG)].
AB  - It was shown that all the examined immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) enhance growth of opsonization of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli which was studied using the chemiluminescence method. However, no opsonization growth was observed of P. aeruginosa rods with the participation of IVIG (except for Sandoglobulin and the specific immunoglobulin Pseudomonas). We assume that such a result was due to the P. aeruginosa strain's susceptibility to lysis factors of the human serum used in the experiment as the complement source. It was confirmed that phagocytosis with the participation of IVIG measured by the chemiluminescence test requires the presence of a complement. The bactericidal test showed that all IVIG preparations, Pentaglobin in particular, are bactericidal and active against P. aeruginosa. Basing on the results obtained, we believe that the biological activity of the Polish preparation is comparable with the investigated IVIG preparations from foreign firms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - Influence of some plasma proteins on in vitro bacterial adherence to PTFE and Dacron vascular prostheses.
AB  - The in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (one strain of each species) to commercially available, microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and woven Dacron vascular grafts before and after coating with human plasma was compared. Standard size segments of the materials were incubated with 35S-labeled bacteria for 0.5-18 h and, following washes, the radioactivity associated with the segment was measured. The binding of each of the tested species to native Dacron was higher than to PTFE. After coating with human plasma, however, the binding of all three species to PTFE was significantly enhanced, whereas the binding to Dacron was reduced. In addition, the influence of coating with serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), fibrinogen (Fg) or fibronectin (Fn) rather than whole plasma was tested. We found that coating with HSA reduced the binding of all three species to Dacron and of staphylococci to PTFE. IgG decreased the binding of S. epidermidis and E. coli to Dacron and of S. epidermidis to PTFE. In contrast, Fg enhanced the binding of S. aureus both to Dacron and PTFE, and that of E. coli to PTFE, but decreased the binding of S. epidermidis and E. coli to Dacron. Fn enhanced the binding of S. aureus to Dacron, and of E. coli to PTFE, but decreased the binding of S. aureus to PTFE and of S. epidermidis both to PTFE and Dacron. Thus, both whole plasma and some isolated plasma proteins were found to modulate bacterial adherence to two tested graft materials. From a clinical point of view, bacterial binding to plasma-coated rather than native materials may more adequately determine the likelihood of in vivo colonization of the various materials. Furthermore, precoating of materials with selected proteins may be of value in the prevention of graft colonization.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and ex vivo susceptibility of cefpodoxime proxetil in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, were determined for eight noninfected patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and eight healthy volunteers. Subjects were matched for sex, age (+/- 6 years), and body weight (+/- 10 kg, except for one pair) and received a single 200-mg (cefpodoxime equivalents) oral dose of the prodrug cefpodoxime proxetil in an open-label, paired-design fashion. Dialysate (CAPD group only), plasma, and urine samples were collected and assayed for cefpodoxime by a microbiologic method. In addition, mean bactericidal titers of the effluent dialysate against selected bacterial strains often associated with CAPD-related peritonitis were determined at 6 and 24 h after the dose. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in all pharmacokinetic parameters between healthy and CAPD subjects, except for lag time to absorption. The mean peak plasma cefpodoxime concentration of 1.88 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml occurred at 2.44 +/- 0.5 h for healthy volunteers, while the peak concentration of 3.25 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml occurred at 12.0 +/- 4.2 h for patients on CAPD. The average elimination half-life in CAPD patients was approximately 12 times greater than that seen in healthy volunteers. Peritoneal dialysis had a minimal effect on cefpodoxime clearance. In healthy volunteers, 24.2% +/- 13% of the dose was recovered from the urine, in contrast to only 5.59% +/- 6.9% for CAPD patients. The mean bactericidal titers for all CAPD patients, at 6 and 24 h, were mostly less than 1:2 and did not exceed 1:4 for any of the isolates. Because of the decreased renal clearance and negligible dialysate clearance of cefpodoxime, and delayed drug absorption, the dosage interval for cefpodoxime proxetil may need to be extended in CAPD patients.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - The effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  - The effect of a direct electric current (10 microA) on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was investigated. When the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. Zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. Bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were similarly affected by the application of a 10 microA electric current. A negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. The results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. This may offer a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.
TI  - Epidemiologic patterns of nosocomial infections in 10 Oklahoma hospitals.
AB  - The epidemiology of nosocomial infections was studied for 5 years in 10 Oklahoma  hospitals. These were categorized into small and large hospitals. The seven small hospitals averaged 47 beds and the three large hospitals averaged 266 beds. Overall, most of the infected patients were < 5 years of > 60 years of age. Females accounted for the majority of the infections. In general, the three most common sites of infection were the urinary tract, surgical wounds, and the lower respiratory tract. Escherichia coli was the single most frequently identified agent followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most frequently reported risk factors among patients acquiring a nosocomial infection were the use of prior antibiotics, indwelling urinary catheters, and intravenous catheters or cut-down. The specific problems associated with nosocomial infections, such as sites of infection, risks of infection, and the types of organisms isolated, essentially had not changed much since the 1960s, the 1970s, and for most of the 1980s.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  - One hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. Beta-Lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-Lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 Streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 Escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 Bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 Proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 Staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). Anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%). However, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. Therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Ultraviolet disinfection of contact lenses.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a method of disinfecting contact lenses and their storage solutions, we contaminated soft lenses (Bausch & Lomb Optima 38), rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses (Oxyflow F-30), and their storage solutions with three common bacteria. Escherichia coli (E.c.), Staphylococcus epidermis (S.e.), and Serratia marcescens (S.m.). The storage solutions used were saline solution and RGP conditioning solution. We determined the exposure times to 253.7-nm wavelength UV radiation necessary to disinfect the contact lenses and solutions. The decimal reduction values (D values) found for UV radiation were 10 to 200 hundred times shorter than reported for currently available disinfection systems. For E.c., sterilization was attained after 100 s of exposure. For S.e. and S.m., sterilization occurred after 300 s of exposure. Different contact lens solutions transmit UV radiation to various degrees, with saline solution passing more than 90% of the UV radiation. Thus, our results indicate that UV radiation is an effective and rapid method of disinfecting contact lenses and their storage solutions.
TI  - Plasmodium falciparum: inhibition of sporogonic development in Anopheles stephensi by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We investigated the effects of bacteria on Plasmodium falciparum sporogonic development in Anopheles stephensi. Four gram-negative (Escherichia coli H243, E. coli HB101, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Ewingella americana) and two gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) bacterial strains were used in the study. Tenfold dilutions of bacteria suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with an infectious meal of gametocyte-enriched cultures and fed to adult mosquitoes. All gram-negative bacteria strains partially or completely inhibited oocyst formation at different concentrations. Additionally, geometric mean number of oocysts showed a correspondingly significant decrease with increasing bacterial concentration (P < 0.001). In contrast, gram-positive bacteria strains did not have any inhibitory effects on oocyst formation even at very high concentrations. Oocyst development was not affected by: (i) culture supernatants of E. americana, (ii) formalin-treated E. coli H243, (iii) lipopolysaccharide of E. coli J5 (mutant of 0111:B4). These studies show that gram-negative but not gram-positive bacteria affect sporogonic-stage development of P. falciparum in A. stephensi. Inhibition of parasite acquisition may be an attribute of specific or nonspecific cytoadherence properties of gram-negative bacteria to the parasites.
TI  - In vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  - Although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. Microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. Gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. We therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative rods against antibiotics. Using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by Maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for Port-A-Cath-systems. Organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae). All organisms but Klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. Production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated Pseudomonas. After 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with various antimicrobial agents. The following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. Despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective MICs of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible organism. These in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - [Effect of ozone on airborne microorganisms].
AB  - The microbicidal effect of ozone in air was tested at concentrations between 50 and 600 micrograms/m3 against the species: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Arthrobacter citreus, Bacillus subtilis (veg.), Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were exposed on membrane filters at 60-75% relative humidity and 21.5-22.5 degrees C. After exposure times between 1 min and 60 min, the filters were incubated on appropriate agar media. The effect of ozone was determined by comparing the number of colonies on exposed filters to the number on nonexposed filters. The die-off curves (colony count against time) proved not to be rectilinear, but to become steeper with increasing time of exposure. Furthermore, the velocity of reduction increased more than proportional with increasing concentration of ozone. Therefore, the bacterial decay seems not to follow first order reaction kinetics. The values presented for k (constant of the velocity of die-off) and D (decimal reduction time) are valid only for narrow ranges of the initial part of the exposure. Concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms (0)3/m3 for 1 h resulted only in little reduction, whereas 500 to 600 micrograms/m3 for one hour led to 99% reduction in all bacterial species tested. The gram-positive species seemed to be more sensitive than the gram-negative species, C. albicans proved to be more resistant than the bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Construction and overexpression in Escherichia coli of genetically engineered derivatives of penicillin-binding protein 2' of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Removal of the putative amino-terminal membrane spanning region of penicillin-binding protein 2' (PBP-2') of Staphylococcus epidermidis WT55 was carried out by truncating the amino terminus-coding end of the mecA gene. PCR and site directed mutagenesis were used to introduce unique restriction sites at position 68 (HindIII) and at position 80 (NcoI) of the mecA gene, respectively. The coupling of the shortened coding regions to the trc promoter and gene fusion to the lacZ gene, aimed to facilitate subsequent protein purifications, resulted in strong expression in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and partial sequestration into insoluble protein granules. The truncated PBP-2' retained its penicillin-binding ability and also bound the monoclonal antibody directed against PBP-2' of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Purification and characterization of EpiA, the peptide substrate for post-translational modifications involved in epidermin biosynthesis.
AB  - For the investigation of enzymes involved in epidermin biosynthesis it is necessary to produce sufficient amounts of preepidermin (EpiA) as a substrate and to design EpiA detection systems. Therefore, EpiA was expressed in Escherichia coli using a malE-epiA fusion. The identity of purified EpiA was confirmed by ion spray mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. For EpiA detection, anti-EpiA antisera were raised. Upon prolonged incubation, factor Xa not only cleaved EpiA from the fusion protein, but also less efficiently cleaved EpiA internally between R-1 and I+1. The internal factor Xa cleavage site of EpiA was masked by altering the sequence -A(-4)-E-P-R(-1)- to -A(-4)-E-P-Q(-1)- by site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - [The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis].
AB  
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and Septi-Chek Release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was made of the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories,  Cranbury, N.J.) and the Septi-Chek Release bottle (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, N.J.). From 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to Centers for Disease Control definitions. Statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the Isolator system: Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.0001), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (P = 0.008), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.05), Salmonella spp. (P = 0.03), and Candida albicans (P = 0.02). The Septi-Chek Release system required a longer period of time than the Isolator system for detection of the following organisms:S. aureus (P = 0.0001), Enterococcus spp. (P = 0.0001), Enterobacter cloacae (P = 0.03), Escherichia coli (P = 0.0001), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.03), K. pneumoniae (P = 0.02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.002), and C. albicans (P = 0.005). There were 430 episodes of bloodstream infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to S. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (P = 0.0001) by the Isolator system than by the Septi-Chek Release system. However, episodes of bloodstream infections due to S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli were detected significantly faster by the Isolator system.
TI  - Regulation of epidermin biosynthetic genes by EpiQ.
AB  - We investigated the role of epiQ in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin. epiQ was essential for epidermin production. It was shown that EpiQ controls epidermin production by transcriptionally activating the epiA promoter, used for transcription of most of the epidermin biosynthetic genes. Additional copies of epiQ increased epidermin production in the epidermin-producing wild-type strain Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu3298. The epiA promoter region was characterized by primer extension analysis. Two inverted repeats, putative operator sites for EpiQ binding, are located upstream of the -35 region and one is localized downstream of the -10 region. Crude protein extracts from S. epidermidis Tu3298 and epiQ expressing Escherichia coli cells led to gel mobility shifts of a DNA fragment bearing the inverted repeat which is located immediately upstream of the -35 region. DNA fragments bearing the other two inverted repeats were not shifted. The epiQ gene product could be detected by overexpression in the E. coli T7 system using antiserum raised against synthetic peptides of EpiQ. Furthermore, EpiQ, like other DNA-binding proteins, was shown to bind strongly to heparin sepharose.
TI  - Continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  - Bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. Adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. In E. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. On the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as S. epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.
TI  - Effect of apigeninidin on the growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - Apigeninidin, a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin present in sorghum, was chemically synthesized and effectively purified by extracting impurities from aqueous 2 N HC1 into ethyl acetate. Apigeninidin (50mumol) applied to filter paper disks inhibited the growth on agar plates of selected gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, andStreptococcus faecalis) and to a lesser extent gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcens, andShigella flexneri). Apigeninidin was not mutagenic based on the Ames assay. The ability of apigeninidin to precipitate proteins from plant extracts could be physiologically important if it can be shown to bind to specific plant proteins.
TI  - Efflux-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Transport processes are used by all organisms to obtain essential nutrients and to expel wastes and other potentially harmful substances from cells. Such processes are important means by which resistance to selected antimicrobial agents in bacteria is achieved. The recently described Staphylococcus aureus norA gene encodes a membrane-associated protein that mediates active efflux of fluoroquinolones from cells. SA-1199B is a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of S. aureus from which we cloned an allele of norA (norA1199). Similar to that of norA, the protein product of norA1199 preferentially mediates efflux of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones in both S. aureus and an Escherichia coli host, a process driven by the proton motive force. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of norA1199 revealed an encoded 388-amino-acid hydrophobic polypeptide 95% homologous with the norA-encoded protein. Significant homology with other proteins involved in transport processes also exists, but especially with tetracycline efflux proteins and with the Bacillus subtilis Bmr protein that mediates active efflux of structurally unrelated compounds, including fluoroquinolones. In S. aureus, the norA1199-encoded protein also appears to function as a multidrug efflux transporter. Southern hybridization studies indicated that norA1199 (or an allele of it) is a naturally occurring S. aureus gene and that related sequences are present in the S. epidermidis genome. The nucleotide sequence of the wild-type allele of norA1199, cloned from the fluoroquinolone-susceptible parent strain of SA-1199B, did not differ from that of norA1199 throughout the coding region. Northern (RNA) and Southern hybridization studies showed that increased transcription, and not gene amplification, of norA1199 is the basis for fluoroquinolone resistance in SA-1199B.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to synthetic vascular prostheses and influence of human plasma. An in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli to five commercially available prosthetic vascular graft materials was compared. The influence of precoating the segments with human plasma for 2 h was also studied. S35-methionine was used to radiolabel bacteria. The segments were exposed to bacterial suspensions of approximately 10(7) CFU/ml at 37 degrees C for 0.5-18h. Following repeated washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), radioactivity associated with the segments was measured. The adherence of the three clinically relevant bacterial species was higher to untreated Dacron than to gelatin or collagen impregnated/coated Dacron or to PTFE. Furthermore, precoating of grafts with human plasma reduced bacterial adherence to woven Dacron, had a little effect on gelatin coated Dacron, but increased the adherence to collagen treated Dacron and, in particular, to PTFE.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Biocompatibility of a glucose-polymer-containing peritoneal dialysis fluid.
AB  - The currently available glucose-containing peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF), which are all hyperosmolar, are toxic to the cells present in the peritoneal cavity. However, glucose-polymer solutions, being isosmolar, may have improved biocompatibility in this respect. We therefore compared in vitro the effects of PDF containing glucose-polymers with that of glucose solutions on the function of donor granulocytes and monocytes (MN), and on the viability of mesothelial cells. In addition, the function of peritoneal macrophages (PMO) of eight patients was studied in a randomized cross-over setting following intraperitoneal exposure to glucose-polymer-versus glucose-monomer-containing fluid of comparable ultrafiltration capacity. Donor granulocytes, as well as MN, showed significantly better phagocytosis of both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli after incubation in the glucose-polymer solution as compared with the 3.86% glucose-containing fluid. Their oxidative metabolism, as measured by chemiluminescence, also showed that the glucose-polymer solution was less inhibitory than fluids containing 2.27 or 3.86% glucose. Patient-derived PMO showed a significantly better phagocytic capacity for S epidermidis and E coli, a significantly higher killing of E coli, and a significantly higher chemiluminescence response after intraperitoneal exposure to the glucose-polymer solution as compared with the glucose-monomer-based fluid. Increasing the osmolality of the glucose-polymer solution to that of the respective glucose solutions blunted the favorable effect on phagocyte function, suggesting the beneficial effect to be osmolality-mediated. However, no major difference was observed between the glucose-polymer solution and the glucose-based fluid in their effects on mesothelial viability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of a micromethod for the bactericidal activity of five disinfectants  on 108 hospital strains].
AB  - The authors studied 5 disinfectants containing aldehyde and quaternary ammonium against 108 hospital strains. The minimal bactericidal activities (MBC) were determined with a microdilution method and the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). The microdilution method results were validated using the MBCs of four reference strains tested with the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). 3 disinfectants proved to be valuable. 1 disinfectant was valuable but with a MBC toward all bacteria only a dilution away from the dilution of use. 1 disinfectant was determined as unsatisfactory as 9.5 p. cent of all strains proved resistant toward it. All disinfectants matched AFNOR standards; but those specifications did not match toward hospital strains. Such an evaluation using a simple and reliable method should be of use.
TI  - A sequential study of intravenous and oral fleroxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study enrolled patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in  a trial to determine the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with intravenous fleroxacin (first 3 days) followed by oral fleroxacin, for a total course of 7-14 days, both administered at a dosage of 400 mg once a day. We enrolled 68 patients with complicated UTIs or acute pyelonephritis, 32 of whom were evaluable for bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli, 15; enterococci, 9; miscellaneous, 15. Intravenous fleroxacin was given for a mean of 3.2 days, followed by oral fleroxacin for a mean of 5.3 days. A total of 27 patients were clinically cured (84%), two improved, and three failed. A total of 26 patients were bacteriologically cured (81%), and six failed (19%). The bacteria that were not eradicated included enterococci, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; and Pseudomonas species, 1. One enterococcal isolate became resistant to fleroxacin. Four patients were bacteremic (E. coli, 3; Proteus mirabilis, 1); the pathogen was eradicated in all cases. Two patients developed urinary enterococcal superinfections. A total of 12 patients experienced 16 adverse reactions remotely, possibly, or probably related to fleroxacin (insomnia, 3; dizziness, 2; miscellaneous, 11). One patient had a grand mal seizure after aspirating gastric contents; the seizure was thought to be only remotely related to the study drug. Fleroxacin was discontinued in two patients because of adverse effects (phlebitis at intravenous access site, 1; anxiety and insomnia, 1). Only minor and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities were observed. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. Fleroxacin is a safe and effective antibiotic for sequential intravenous and oral treatment of acute pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs. Enterococci may be problematic pathogens, as reported with other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Septic shock in critically ill patients: aetiology, management and outcome.
AB  - Over a period of 28 months, 45 episodes of septic shock from 83 episodes of bacteraemia were studied prospectively to evaluate their clinical profile, management and outcome. Thirty-six patients were studied, the overall incidence of septic shock being 54.2%. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 23 (51.1%) of such episodes, Gram-positive 17 (37.8%), and three episodes were polymicrobial (6.7%). The organisms isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3%), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. (each 11.1%). Coagulation abnormalities were detected in 32 episodes (78%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred in 11 of these with high mortality. The most common underlying conditions were respiratory, hepatic and renal failures. The majority of these patients received crystalloids, colloids, vasopressor drugs and blood. Swan-Ganz catheters (SGC) were inserted on eight occasions, the majority of times indicating a hyperdynamic circulatory response. The overall mortality was 40%, despite aggressive management and intensive care. The most important factor in reducing mortality is early detection of bacteraemia and prompt management of these patients.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver collected transvaginally  for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - Transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells is a new therapy for fetuses diagnosed in utero with inherited disorders. However, prior to transplantation of fetal stem cells, the cells must be free of microbial contamination. In order to investigate the contamination of human fetal liver tissue, we determined the rate and types of bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver tissue collected transvaginally for use in stem cell transplantation by using the US Pharmacopoiea Assay. We found a high rate of contamination with bacteria or fungi (12 of the 14 fetal livers, or 85%). Non-fermenting gram-negative rods were the predominant contaminants. The high rate of microbial contamination of fetal tissue suggests that techniques for tissue collection need to be improved before fetal stem cells are used for clinical transplantation.
TI  - In vivo exposure to the currently available peritoneal dialysis fluids decreases  the function of peritoneal macrophages in CAPD.
AB  - Previous in vitro studies have revealed that the currently available peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) inhibit several functions of phagocytic cells. To investigate the clinical relevance of those in vitro findings, we compared the in vivo effect of PDF pH on peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. In a randomized crossover setting, each of eight patients used exclusively PDF at pH five (D5) or pH seven (D7) on day one. The next day the patients who used D5 were switched to D7 and vice versa. Likewise the effect of glucose-mediated hypertonicity was studied in eight other patients, using PDF with 1.36% glucose (D136) or 3.86% glucose (D386). PMO were isolated from the effluents and studied for their phagocytic and killing capacity, and their ability to mount a respiratory burst (chemiluminescence response). PMO obtained after the intraperitoneal instillation of D7 were significantly better able to phagocytize both S. epidermidis (65 +/- 9 vs 37 +/- 8% uptake, p < 0.005) and E. coli (43 +/- 8 vs 25 +/- 4% uptake, p < 0.005). In addition, PMO harvested from D7 effluents revealed a significantly higher killing capacity than PMO derived from D5 effluents for S. epidermidis (60 +/- 5 vs 38 +/- 6%, p < 0.005) as well as for E. coli (51 +/- 10 vs 25 +/- 9%, p < 0.025). Moreover, PMO derived from D7 effluents mounted a significantly higher respiratory burst as compared to PMO in vivo exposed to D5 for the same time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular analysis and expression of the lipase of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Lipase of Staphylococcus epidermidis 9 was purified from culture supernatant fluid. Two polypeptides (51 and 43 kDa) were detected by SDS-PAGE, of which the 43 kDa polypeptide reacted with anti-lipase serum. The S. epidermidis 9 lipase gene (gehC) was cloned in Escherichia coli and localized to a 2.1 kb sequence by subcloning and transposon mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequence of gehC (2064 nucleotides) was determined and the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded lipase (77 kDa) identified. A 97 kDa lipase was detected in extracts of E. coli harbouring gehC and in post-exponential-phase culture supernatant fluids of S. epidermidis 9. Data presented indicate that the lipase behaves anomalously during SDS-PAGE and that a pro-lipase is proteolytically processed in cultures of S. epidermidis 9 during growth.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of transposon mutants of Staphylococcus epidermidis deficient in capsular polysaccharide/adhesin and slime.
AB  - We used transposon (Tn) mutagenesis to study the role of capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (PS/A) and slime in adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to catheters. pLTV1, containing Tn917-LTV1, was transformed into S. epidermidis M187 by protoplast fusion with S. aureus RN4220(pLTV1), creating M187(pLTV1). Tn mutants were isolated following growth at 42 degrees C; mutants deficient in PS/A and slime production were selected. PS/A- and slime-deficient Tn mutants had a 10-fold decrease in vitro in the initial phase of adherence to catheters, comparable to levels of strains that do not produce PS/A. Introduction of Tn917-LTV1-interrupted DNA from PS/A-deficient mutant M187sn3 into the parental strain via transformation of protoplasts yielded recipients with inserts identical to those of the Tn mutant that were PS/A and slime deficient. Chromosomal DNA flanking the Tn in mutant M187sn3 was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA was found to hybridize to approximately 5-kb EcoRI fragments from the parental strain and from control Tn mutants that express parental levels of PS/A and to either approximately 9- or approximately 14-kb EcoRI fragments from other highly adherent, PS/A-producing strains. Mapping studies demonstrated that in the eight PS/A-deficient mutants that have been isolated, the Tn insertions all occur within a region of approximately 11.6 kb that is defined by three EcoRI sites. These results support previous findings indicating that in S. epidermidis PS/A is involved with in vitro adherence to plastic biomaterials and elaboration of PS/A is closely associated with slime production.
TI  - In vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. To evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at pH of 7.2. Clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. Methicillin-susceptible S aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. Cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against E coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus S pneumoniae. The gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against K pneumoniae and E coli. These results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible S aureus, K pneumoniae, and E coli. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Migration of bacteria along synthetic polymeric fibers.
AB  - E. coli, S. epidermidis, and B. distasonis were observed to migrate readily along polymer fibers impressed upon the surface of nutrient agar. E. coli was also observed to migrate readily along polymer fibers embedded in brain-heart infusion agar. Within periods of about 24 h, migration distances of about several centimeters were observed. No migration was observed in control experiments conducted on or in the same media, but without fibers. Migration speed was greatest for E. coli and slowest for B. distasonis. Cell population density was found to decrease rapidly with distance from a source culture. Swimming motility or natural convection in liquid between fiber and gel appears to be improbable based on the expected dimensions of capillary-condensed liquid between fiber and gel.
TI  - [Nosocomial infection in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation].
AB  - During a two-year period (1988-1989), were studied newborns treated with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). The goal was to know incidence of infections in these patients and characteristics of these process. Of 187, 40 (21.3%) were infected. For these neonates the mean gestational age was 33 +/- 3 weeks and average for birth weight was 1755 +/- 644 g. In 32 the infecting agent was isolated, being the most common coagulase negative Staphylococcus, it was found in 18 (45%), Klebsiella sp in 7 (17%), Escherichia coli in 1 and Candida albicans in 1. In the remaining 8 (20%) with negative cultures, postmortem confirmation was made in 5 and in 3 by clinical, radiologic or hematologic evidence. Of the 17 positive blood cultures and 3 spinal fluid culture, the same bacteria grew as in the bronchial aspirate. Were found, thrombocytopenia in 22 (55%) and leucocytosis in 19 (47%) as the most common blood changes. Pneumonia was the most common form of infection; it was found in 30 (75%); 22 of 40 died (55%). We concluded that 21.3% of neonates under IMV without infections, may get infected later in the hospital. S. epidermidis is the etiologic agent that predominates through the whole year, except during epidemics caused by others agents.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin: genomic organization and membrane localization of the NisB protein.
AB  - Nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis 6F3 is used as a food preservative and is the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Gotz, H. Zahner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). Nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisA, encodes a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active lantibiotic (C. Kaletta and K.-D. Entian, J. Bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). Adjacent to nisA, the additional genes nisB, nisT, and nisC were identified. Over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu 3298. Genes nisB, nisT, and nisC corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. The nisT open reading frame is homologous to proteins of the HlyB (hemolysin B protein of Escherichia coli) subfamily. Proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and anti-drug tumors, indicating that NisT may be involved in nisin transport. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisA structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisA gene was determined by primer extension. Additionally, a mRNA of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisB. Antibodies were raised against the NisB protein, and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kDa, which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kDa as calculated from the nisB open reading frame. Several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that NisB is associated with the membrane. This was confirmed by preparing L. lactis vesicles. The NisB protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. These results suggest that NisB is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin vs. ciprofloxacin in complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - This prospective, open, randomized clinical study compared the efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in adult patients with complicated urinary tract infection, defined as infection in the presence of an underlying anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract. Seventy-two patients were randomized, 37 received norfloxacin (400 mg orally twice daily for 10-21 days) and 35 received ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally every 12 hours for 14-21 days). Patients were clinically assessed, and urine cultures were obtained following two to four days of therapy, and five to nine days and four to six weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Seventy-two percent of the norfloxacin group and 79 percent of the ciprofloxacin group were considered cured. This difference was not significant. One failure of norfloxacin therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following norfloxacin therapy, in 2 patients superinfections developed with resistant organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis [1] and Pseudomonas maltophilia [1]). Twelve patients, 6 in each group, experienced adverse reactions, which were considered related to the study drug therapy in only four instances. Our results indicated comparable efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in adults.
TI  - Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. Of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). The organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. Of the organisms isolated, 77% were Gram positive cocci, 15% Gram negative rods and 8% Candida. No blockage of the stents occurred. All of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. None of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections while the stent remained in place. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. Clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. The high recovery rate of Gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. The findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with Gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.
TI  - Differentiation of round cells in semen by means of monoclonal antibodies and relationship with male fertility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To differentiate round cells in semen samples of subfertile men and evaluate the clinical significance during infertility investigation. PATIENTS: One hundred and eight randomly chosen couples with a median duration of infertility of 4 (range, 1 to 20) years presenting at the outpatient infertility clinic of the University of Heidelberg, Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differentiation of round cells in semen by means of monoclonal antibodies (mABs) and a streptavidin-biotin system for staining. Correlation of results with medical history, outcome of clinical examination, sperm analysis, microbial screening of both partners, evaluation of sperm functional capacity in vivo by means of the postcoital test (PCT) and in vitro with the standardized crossed sperm-cervical mucus penetration test (SCMPT) and the subsequent fertility in a prospective study. RESULTS: The method used for differentiation of round cells proved to be practical and suitable for routine use. The percentage of leukocytes ranged from 0% to 58% with a median of 3%. Number of round cells and percentage of leukocytes did not differ markedly with regard to andrologic history, clinical findings, for example, varicocele, results of standard sperm analysis, and microbial colonization of semen samples. However, high rates of leukocytes of the round cells correlated with reduced sperm count and morphology and results of PCT. Leukocyte-positive (> 15% leukocytes) specimens were also significantly more frequent in case of inadequate SCMPT and reduced sperm penetration ability in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients (in terms of genital tract infection), the majority of round cells consist of immature germ cells and < 5% are white blood cells. The streptavidin-biotin system and the mABs used in this study proved to be useful to identify patients with elevated rates of leukocytes in semen possibly reflecting subclinical genital tract infection with influence on sperm functional capacity and subsequent fertility. Thus the procedure can be recommended to be included in a comprehensive evaluation of male fertility.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of sparfloxacin.
AB  - Sparfloxacin was found to display a biphasic response against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in nutrient broth. Its optimum bactericidal concentration was found to be identical for all three species which contrasts with other clinically available fluoroquinolones that are more active against E. coli than against staphylococci. Bacterial protein and RNA synthesis as well as cell division were not found to be essential for all the lethality of sparfloxacin, which hence displays bactericidal mechanism B. However, sparfloxacin was unable to kill bacteria in absence of oxygen.
TI  - In vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent which  has an oxazine ring structure with a cyclopropyl moiety at C-10, was compared with those of other agents against 2,854 clinical isolates. T-3761 had a broad spectrum of activity and had potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin. Some isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (MIC of ciprofloxacin, greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) were still susceptible to T-3761 (MIC of T-3761, less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml). The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the streptococci and enterococci tested were 3.13 to 100 micrograms/ml. Its activity was equal to or 2- or 4-fold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, equal to or 2- or 4-fold less than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 4- to 16-fold less than that of tosufloxacin. The activity of T-3761 against gram-negative bacteria was usually fourfold greater than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin. Many isolates which were resistant to nonfluoroquinolone agents, such as minocycline- or imipenem-resistant S. aureus, ceftazidime-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were susceptible to T-3761. The MBCs of T-3761 were either equal to or twofold greater than the MICs. The number of viable cells decreased rapidly during incubation with T-3761 at one to four times the MIC. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3761 against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa were 2.2 x 10(-8) to less than or equal to 1.2 x 10(-9). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T-3761 for DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 0.88 and 1.9 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Comparison of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 with regions encoding gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis isolates from diverse geographic locations.
AB  - The genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (Gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pBEM10 of Enterococcus faecalis HH22 is carried on a transposon, termed Tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in United States isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. We have now studied plasmid DNA from Gmr strains of E. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (Houston, Pennsylvania, Thailand, and Chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization to determine whether other Gmr E. faecalis carry Tn5281 or a similar type of element. We also compared these enterococci to several United States isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile Gmr determinants. Three E. faecalis isolates (from Houston and Chile) carried Tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from Houston and Pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and DNA-DNA hybridization patterns more similar to those of the Tn4001-IS257 hybrid found in the nonmobile Gmr determinants in United States isolates of S. aureus. A strain from Thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either Tn5281 or the nonmobile Gmr determinants present in United States isolates of S. aureus. Our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the Gmr determinant of strains of E. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Acanthamoeba keratitis: synergy between amebic and bacterial cocontaminants in contact lens care systems as a prelude to infection.
AB  - We encountered a patient with Acanthamoeba keratitis whose contact lens care solution contained numerous trophozoites and cysts admixed with Xanthomonas maltophilia organisms, many of which were adherent to the trophozoite surface and internalized within endocytic vacuoles. Because of this finding, we investigated the role of bacterial cocontaminants in contact lens care systems as substrates for the growth of Acanthamoeba spp. Individual cocultivation of Acanthamoeba castellanii and A. polyphaga with X. maltophilia, Flavobacterium breve, and Pseudomonas paucimobilis showed better enhancement (1.5x) of ameba growth after 96 h than that obtained in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, the standard cocultivation species used for isolation of amebae from clinical specimens. Our data suggest that contamination of contact lens care systems with Acanthamoeba spp. and a bacterial species capable of supporting amebic growth may be the first step in the pathogenesis of ameba-induced keratitis by the provision of large inocula of amebae.
TI  - MHC-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
AB  - A CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell clone (A35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. This clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. There was no restriction by polymorphic parts of HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules and a HLA class II-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected HLA class I-deficient cells (Daudi cells) were not. The clone showed crossreaction between Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. MAb to CD2, CD3, and CD8 efficiently blocked A35, whereas the addition of mAb to HLA class II or to HLA class I did not. This clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.
TI  - Purification and characterization of EpiD, a flavoprotein involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded epidermin biosynthesis gene, epiD, of Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu3298 was expressed in Escherichia coli by using both the malE fusion system and the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter system. EpiD was identified by Western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP)-EpiD antiserum. EpiD and the MBP-EpiD fusion protein, which were mainly present in the soluble protein fraction, were purified from the respective E. coli clones. Purified EpiD showed the typical absorption spectrum of an oxidized flavoprotein with maxima at 274, 382, and 453 nm. The coenzyme released from EpiD by heat treatment was identified as flavin mononucleotide. S. epidermidis Tu3298/EMS11, containing a mutation within epiD, was unable to synthesize active epidermin. This mutated gene, epiD*, was cloned in E. coli and expressed as an MBP-EpiD* fusion protein. DNA sequencing of epiD* identified a point mutation that led to replacement of Gly-93 with Asp. Unlike MBP-EpiD, the fusion protein MBP-EpiD* could not bind flavin mononucleotide. We propose that EpiD catalyzes the removal of two reducing equivalents from the cysteine residue of the C-terminal meso-lanthionine to form a --C==C-- double bond and is therefore involved in formation of the unusual S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl[-D-cysteine structure in epidermin.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  - During the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. It is likely that the strains of C-NS causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. We have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. A swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. The numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. The species of C-NS found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. However, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. There was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. There appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. C-NS were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. Other organisms isolated included Propionibacterium sp, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pityrosporum sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant C-NS during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - The bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of trospectomycin.
AB  - Trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, TRS) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. This study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of TRS. Species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for TRS; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli, and bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). When TRS was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following PAE values were recorded: S. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, En. faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.6 hr, E. coli UC 311, 1.5 hr, E. coli UC 9451, 1.5 hr, H. influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, 5.2 hr, and B. fragilis UC 12199, 6.7 hr. The broad-spectrum PAE that was observed for TRS is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Evaluation of strategies for central venous catheter replacement.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the consequences of leaving a bacterially colonized central venous catheter in place and to compare the effects of three catheter replacement strategies for catheter repair control in an animal model. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Laboratory and animal facility of a large university. SUBJECTS: Eighteen healthy, female, adult sheep. INTERVENTIONS: Radiopaque-siliconized elastomer central venous catheters were inserted into the jugular veins and colonized with either Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis. After 7 days of infection, the catheters were either: a) exchanged using a guidewire; b) removed and replaced with a new catheter in a new jugular vein site after a 48-hr interval; or c) exchanged using a guidewire and antibiotics (tobramycin, cephaloridine) injected into the catheter. Animals were euthanized 7 days after insertion of the new catheter. Quantitative microbiology was performed on blood samples collected daily from the catheters and a peripheral vein, as well as from catheters and tissue recovered from the sheep at the time of autopsy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULT: When catheters were changed using a guidewire, they became colonized by bacteria within 48 hrs, and the sheep had embolic pneumonia and vegetative endocarditis at autopsy. Similar consequences were observed when antibiotics were administered into the catheter lumen. If colonized catheters were removed and a new catheter was inserted after a 48-hr interval, recolonization, pneumonia, and endocarditis were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of a biofilm-colonized central venous catheter over a guidewire is associated with rapid colonization of the replacement catheter and production of detached, slime-enclosed, antibiotic-resistant aggregates that colonize other catheters or initiate endocarditis or pneumonia by dissemination in the bloodstream.
TI  - Lethal Fournier's gangrene following vasectomy.
AB  - A case is presented of a healthy young man who had Fournier's gangrene after standard bilateral vasectomy. Despite maximal treatment, including extensive necrectomy and broad-spectrum antibiotics, this complication was lethal. To our knowledge a lethal complication of vasectomy has not been reported in the literature.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of a new molecular method for typing Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The discriminatory powers of several techniques for typing Staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated in an epidemiological study of bacteria isolated from intensive care patients and from neonates. Genomic DNA fingerprinting using BclI restriction endonuclease was an effective epidemiological marker. The distinct restriction fragment profiles produced with this enzyme were highlighted with specific probes in a Southern blot technique. Cloned Escherichia coli rRNA gene probes proved to have lower discriminatory power and be less suitable for intraspecies typing. However, a panel of random genomic Staphylococcus epidermidis DNA clones provided almost the same level of discrimination as the DNA fingerprinting technique and also provided a clearer profile. DNA and gene fingerprinting techniques were reproducible and highly discriminatory compared to typing based on antigen and plasmid profiles, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and biotypes.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  - A prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. Intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. Wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. The figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. The commonest causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, Escherichia coli 16.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. When isolated intra-operatively, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound infection, but the intra-operative isolation of Bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone, PD 131628.
AB  - A new 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone antimicrobial, PD131628, was found to be as, or more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against Escherichia coli and considerably more active than the two 4-quinolone agents against staphylococci in terms of both MIC and OBC (the optimum bactericidal concentration, at which the rate of kill is greatest). In common with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, the rate of kill of PD131628 against Enterococcus faecalis was considerably slower than against the other three species tested. Bacterial protein synthesis, RNA synthesis and cell division were not required for the bactericidal activity of PD131628 against E. coli or the staphylococci, although the lethality of PD131628 in the absence of these activities was reduced.
TI  - Contamination in contact lens care systems.
AB  - We studied the rate of contamination in the contact lens care systems and conjunctivas of 30 asymptomatic cosmetic soft contact lens wearers. In caring for their lenses, 23 patients used chemical disinfection systems (quaternary ammonium solutions), six patients used hydrogen peroxide, and one used heat. Eighteen patients used unpreserved intravenous saline solution, and only seven patients used commercially prepared preserved saline solutions. Cultures were obtained from lens cases, lens care solutions, and conjunctivas. Contamination was found in 70% of the lens care systems. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had lens case contamination, and 17% had conjunctival contamination. The most frequently isolated bacteria in the lens care systems were Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. We suggest the development of more effective systems for disinfection.
TI  - Ribotyping of coagulase-negative staphylococci with special emphasis on intraspecific typing of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, are increasingly being recognized as opportunistic pathogens. They are often multiply antibiotic resistant and can cause nosocomial outbreaks. For clinical and epidemiological reasons, accurate species identification and typing are imperative. Ribotyping, i.e., the generation of characteristic fragment patterns by hybridization of restriction endonuclease fragments of total DNA with labeled standard rRNA from Escherichia coli, has been applied to CoNS for species identification by various investigators. The present study, involving 115 randomly collected clinical isolates of CoNS, provides ambiguous evidence with respect to those findings. Eighty six S. epidermidis strains were ribotyped intraspecifically. Eleven different ribotypes were found after digestion with EcoRI, and 10 were found with HindIII. A combination of the two restriction endonucleases resulted in an increase in the discriminatory power (DP) from 14.3 to 31.6%. A combination of ribotyping with biotyping raised the DP to a maximum of 48.6%. The reproducibility of ribotyping was 100% after greater than 400 generations of growth. No correlation between methicillin resistance and certain ribotypes among the S. epidermidis strains was observed. Ribotyping is considered a useful tool for the intraspecific typing of CoNS for epidemiological purposes. The DP can be increased by the use of additional restriction endonucleases.
TI  - Mobilization of recombinant plasmids from Staphylococcus aureus into coagulase negative Staphylococcus species.
AB  - pC221, a small nonconjugative staphylococcal plasmid, can be mobilized between staphylococci by pG01, a larger conjugative plasmid. pC221 carries the two transacting genes, mobA and mobB, which are needed for its mobilization. The products of these genes create a site-specific single-stranded nick (mobA) and then facilitate DNA transfer (mobB). Several useful Escherichia coli-staphylococcal shuttle plasmids containing the cloned single-stranded nick site were created and successfully mobilized into Staphylococcus aureus and two coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus, by providing mob genes (pC221) and conjugative transfer genes (pG01) in trans in the donor. These vectors may offer a genetic system for the introduction of recombinant plasmids into coagulase negative staphylococci.
TI  - Construction of a water-soluble form of penicillin-binding protein 2a from a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate.
AB  - The mecA gene from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 27r, which encodes the membrane-bound penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP 2a), was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. PBP 2a is the major factor that mediates methicillin resistance in staphylococci. The DNA sequence of the mecA gene from strain 27r was greater than 99% identical to the DNA sequence of other S. aureus mecA genes and the mecA gene from Staphylococcus epidermidis. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of PBP 2a from strain 27r revealed a hydrophobic region at the amino terminus that possessed characteristics of an uncleaved signal peptide such as those found in type II integral membrane proteins. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to modify the strain 27r mecA gene to permit removal of the region encoding the putative transmembrane region (amino acids 2 to 22). When it was expressed in E. coli, the modified mecA gene from strain 27r encoded a water-soluble form of PBP 2a that was detectable in the cytoplasm of transformants. The water-soluble form of PBP 2a protein from S. aureus 27r retained the same binding efficiency for beta-lactam antibiotics as the unmodified membrane-bound PBP 2a from S. aureus 27r.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - Analysis of strike-through contamination in saturated sterile dressings.
AB  - The method of saturating gauze sponges directly in their wrapper was tested to determine strike-through contamination. Contamination occurred in 100% of the uncoated-wrapper sponges, regardless of exposure to Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli. Among coated-wrapper sponges, 80% exposed to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 20% exposed to Escherichia coli demonstrated strike-through contamination. Coated-wrapper sponges had a significantly lower rate of contamination than uncoated-wrapper sponges when exposed to Escherichia coli. Occurrence of contamination of all sponges was significantly higher from Staphylococcus epidermidis. The findings render the popular practice of saturating gauze sponges in their wrapper unacceptable.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  - Using the D value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the Microbiological Guidelines proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Six bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens) and two fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) were investigated. The disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (AOSept, MiraSept, Oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (Aerotab and Softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (ReNu and Opti-Free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (Hydrocare Cleaning and Soaking Solution). The one-step hydrogen peroxide system (AOSept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. To facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. This has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. Because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of D values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. Our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the FDA recommendations for bacterial challenge. Most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. However, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the Hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vivo measure of average bacterial cell size from a polarized light scattering  function.
AB  - A particular combination of elements of the Mueller matrix for scattering of polarized light given by (S34 + S14)/(S11 + S13) identical to (S34/S11)++ is measured vs angle at a wavelength of 633 nm for randomly oriented suspensions of several species of bacteria in different stages of growth. (This combination of elements is dominated in the present measurements by the behavior of the normalized S34 matrix element, as is indicated by the notation defined on the right side of the equation.) The resulting graph in each case shows an oscillating function of angle. This function is compressed toward smaller angles when the bacteria are in the exponential phase of growth in comparison with results for a suspension of the same bacteria in the stationary (starving-smaller cells) phase of growth. Microscopic measurements were made to determine, for each case, the average dimensions of the bacterial population. Graphs were then plotted of the peak positions from the Mueller matrix function plots vs either cell length or cell diameter. The function was shown to be strongly correlated with cell diameter under the conditions of this experiment and poorly correlated with cell length. The measurements were shown to have a sensitivity to changes in average diameter of about 20 nm.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - [Surgical bacteremia. Analysis of 210 episodes with special attention to factors  influencing prognosis].
AB  - From January 1984 to April 1987, we have prospectively studied 210 consecutive episodes of bacteremia recorded in patients who underwent major surgical procedures. The incidence rate was 6.4 episodes/1000 surgical procedures. Men were responsible of 73.8% of episodes. The highest incidence was recorded in general surgery patients and the lowest in Ob & Gyn patients. Bacteremia-related mortality was 15.2% (overall mortality 29.5%). The five most common microorganisms isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.7%), polymicrobial flora (13.3%), Escherichia coli (11.4%) and Pseudomonas sp. (9.5%). The common sources of bacteremia were intravascular devices (34.7%), surgical wound infection (28.5%) and urinary tract infection (12.8%). Multivariant analysis identified six variables that influence an adverse prognosis: complications, source of sepsis in a joint or unknown, admission in trauma or vascular surgery department, development of sepsis between the second and eight postoperative day, chronic illness or fatal underlying disease and sepsis after clean surgical procedures.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on Staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Salmonella typhimurium (Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re of LPS mutants) and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (209P, Cowan I, Smith diffuse and Smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and K) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. Escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, such as Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. Lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against M. lysodeikticus and B. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. With regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, NP1, NP4, and NP5, NP1 showed strong bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. Neither NP4 nor NP5 showed any bactericidal activity, while NP5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of NP1 against K. pneumoniae 277.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to pefloxacin and 14 antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin against 782 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients (July-September 1991) in Wroclaw was compared with that of 14 antibiotics (4 aminoglycosides and 10 beta-lactamase). The most susceptible to pefloxacin were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.0%), Klebsiella (94.4%), Proteus mirabilis (93.8%) and Escherichia coli (92.7%). The least susceptible proved to be: nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (46.5%), and among them Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3% weakly sensitive, 0% sensitive strains). It was found that over 80% of Gram-negative rods were susceptible to pefloxacin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The most active against staphylococci were netilmicin (92.6%), pefloxacin (89.4%) and amikacin (82.5%).
TI  - Exit-site and tunnel infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - One hundred two exit-site infections (ESI) were diagnosed in 63 of 163 (38.6%) patients, with an incidence of one episode every 23.7 patient-months in patients with a history of ESI, whereas in the overall continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population the incidence was one episode every 48.7 patient-months. In diminishing order of frequency, the bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The probability of remaining free of ESI was 72% at 1 year and 45% at 5 years. The ESI that led to catheter removal were due to S aureus and gram-negative rods. In 13 (48%) of 27 S aureus ESI unresponsive to antibiotics and local care, deroofing and outer cuff shaving completely resolved the ESI. Despite this treatment, the catheters of the remaining 14 patients had to be removed because of peritonitis associated with the tunnel infection. In conclusion, ESI is a major cause of CAPD failure. In our series, shaving the cuff as a rescue treatment was effective for almost 50% of the patients with antibiotic-resistant S aureus ESI.

TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative trial of norfloxacin and macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin) in the prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - Eighty-eight women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (at least  four attacks in the preceding 12 months) were randomized to take either norfloxacin 200 mg at night (45 patients) or macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin 100 mg at night (43 patients) for 12 months. A decrease in the number of symptomatic attacks while taking this prophylaxis was observed in 94 per cent of the patients and this improvement was maintained during the 6 months following the end of prophylaxis in 69 per cent. The mean interval between symptomatic episodes while taking prophylaxis was 7.2-fold and 6.9-fold greater, respectively, than in the 12 months before starting prophylaxis. There were only nine breakthrough infections during 74 patient-years of prophylaxis, four in patients taking norfloxacin (two enterococci, one Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Escherichia coli), and five in those taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (four E. coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae). Adverse events caused four patients taking norfloxacin (8 per cent) and seven taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (14 per cent) to stop prophylaxis. Norfloxacin had a marked suppressive effect on the coliform part of the faecal flora, with no emergence of resistance. Thus, norfloxacin appears to be an excellent alternative agent to macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin for the prevention of recurrent urinary infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical study of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) on bacterial prostatitis].
AB  - The cefoperazone and sulbactam concentrations in human prostatic fluid were measured following intravenous administration of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) and its clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of 11 patients with acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis were evaluated. Cefoperazone concentrations in prostatic fluid (PF) one hour after an intravenous infusion of SBT/CPZ at a dose of 1 g and 2 g were 0.57 +/- 0.26 micrograms/ml and 1.37 +/- 0.86 micrograms/ml, respectively, both exceeding the MIC against most of the isolated strains from expressed prostatic secretion (EPS). The sulbactam levels in PF at doses of 1 g and 2 g of SBT/CPZ were 0.30 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml and 0.38 +/- 0.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, both of which were high enough to potentiate antimicrobial activity of cefoperazone. The peak of MIC distribution of sulbactam/cefoperazone against E. coli (14 strains) and S. epidermidis (21 strains) isolated from EPS of patients with bacterial prostatitis was in a range of 0.1-0.2 micrograms/ml and 0.2-0.78 micrograms/ml as described for the cefoperazone concentration, respectively, which were superior to those of cefoperazone, ceftazidime and piperacillin, all compared as control, SBT/CPZ exhibited 8 fold or more potent antimicrobial activity than cefoperazone against beta-lactamase producing E. coli and CNS. Clinically, SBT/CPZ was given to 11 patients diagnosed as having bacterial prostatitis in a daily dose of 2-4 g for 5 to 8 days. The drug was found to be effective in all (100%) of 5 patients with acute prostatitis and in 3 (75.0%) of 4 patients who were judged to be assessable among 6 chronic patients. No side effects of any kind were observed in any of the patients treated. In laboratory tests, a transient thrombocytopenia was reported for one patient. SBT/CPZ is particularly useful in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis caused by GNR. This drug is useful for chronic prostatitis those, caused primarily by CNS which is susceptible to this agent. This drug is available as an injectable form, subjects for its appropriate usage will be those who show acute exacerbation of infection or who do not respond to oral therapy.
TI  - The effects of three non-antibiotic, antimicrobial agents on the surface hydrophobicity of certain micro-organisms evaluated by different methods.
AB  - The effects of three non-antibiotic, antimicrobial agents (taurolidine, chlorhexidine acetate and providone-iodine) on the surface hydrophobicity of the clinical strains Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans were examined. Three recognized techniques for hydrophobicity measurements, Bacterial Adherence to Hydrocarbons (BATH), the Salt Aggregation Test (SAT) and Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) were compared. At concentrations reported to interfere with microbial-epithelial cell adherence, all three agents altered the cell surface hydrophobicity. However, these effects failed to exhibit a uniform relationship. Generally, taurolidine and povidone-iodine treatments decreased the hydrophobicity of the strains examined whereas chlorhexidine acetate effects depended upon the micro-organism treated. Subsequently, the exact contribution of altered cell surface hydrophobicity to the reported microbial anti-adherence effects is unclear. Comparison of the three techniques revealed a better correlation between the results obtained with the BATH test and HIC than the results obtained with the BATH and SAT or SAT and HIC. However, these differences may be due to the inaccuracy associated with the visual assessment of results employed by the SAT.
TI  - Effect of NaCl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  - Staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or Escherichia coli. They have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. The mechanisms of NaCl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (K+) in response to graded amounts of NaCl. Staphylococci as well as E. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. In response to 0.9 mol/L NaCl, E. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in K+. Enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in K+. In contrast, strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and K+ than other organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. Glycine betaine rose in some strains, but K+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of NaCl was increased. The high concentrations of glycine betaine and K+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.
TI  - White cells protect donor blood against bacterial contamination.
AB  - The possible beneficial role of white cells (WBCs) in donor blood has been investigated with respect to their capacity to remove bacteria. Preparations of buffy coat and whole blood, containing as well as reduced of WBCs, were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium species. Upon storage at room temperature, the presence of WBCs resulted in a reduction of the bacterial content. Units inoculated with S. epidermidis and E. coli were completely cleared of bacteria within 5 to 24 hours. On the other hand, S. aureus, after an initial reduction in number, started to multiply. In WBC-reduced units, the initial bacterial content remained unchanged for 5 hours, but the bacteria then exhibited vigorous growth within 48 hours in buffy coat and slower growth in whole blood. Propionibacterium sp. did not grow with or without WBCs. P. aeruginosa did not grow in buffy coat but showed a growth pattern similar to that of S. aureus in whole blood. The presence of WBCs in the donor blood during the first hours after collection thus seems to rid the blood of at least some species of bacteria. These results indicate that it would be favorable not to perform WBC reduction during blood collection and that several hours of contact can be needed to obtain sterility.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relative availability of transferrin-bound iron and cell-derived iron to aerobactin-producing and enterochelin-producing strains of Escherichia coli and to other microorganisms.
AB  - A method is described for determination of the relative availability of transferrin-bound iron and cell-derived iron to microbial iron-scavenging mechanisms. This involved incubation of parallel cultures of microorganisms in dialysis tubes placed in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium containing 30%-iron-saturated transferrin and K562 erythroleukemia cells. In one culture the transferrin was labelled with 59Fe and in the other the cells were labelled, and the relative uptake of radioiron by the microorganisms determined. The results showed that Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus acquired iron predominantly from cells, while Candida albicans and the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli NCTC 8623 tended to acquire iron from transferrin. E. coli K-12 strains W3110 and LG1705, which (like NCTC 8623) produce the siderophore enterochelin but not aerobactin, acquired predominantly transferrin-bound iron, whereas the related E. coli strains LG1315 and LG1628, which produce aerobactin but not enterochelin, showed a preference for cell-derived iron. When the cells were incubated in the presence of 59Fe-labelled transferrin and 55Fe-labelled ferritin, no difference in relative availability of iron to E. coli was observed, suggesting that differences in the ability of aerobactin and enterochelin to remove iron from intracellular ferritin were not responsible for this preference. These results may help to explain why production of aerobactin, despite its relatively low affinity for iron, is more closely associated with invasiveness in E. coli than is enterochelin production. Reduced availability of cell-bound iron during inflammation may contribute to antimicrobial defenses.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Maternal morbidity after abdominal cesarean section in relation to bacterial amniotic fluid colonization and premature rupture of fetal membranes].
AB  - At the time of Caesarean section, amniotic fluid was collected transabdominally from 1025 patients. In 990 patients cultures were performed on the amniotic fluid. The incidence of Caesarean section of all patients was 16.1%, the perinatal mortality in all patients 0.61%, in cases of Caesarean section 1.93%. The influence of bacterial colonisation in the amniotic cavity was analyzed with respect to premature ruptured membranes and frequency of vaginal examinations on the maternal post-operative morbidity (wound-seroma and abscess 2.4%, febrile morbidity 17%, urinary tract infection 19%). Bacterial contamination was present in 33.3% of the amniotic fluid or uterine cavity, after ruptured membranes in 44.3%, without ruptured membranes in 23.35%. There is a significant influence of the positive cultured amniotic fluid on the wound healing and on the febrile morbidity, while the urinary tract infection has been not influenced. The bacterial contamination of the amniotic fluid is correlated to the frequency of vaginal examination and the presence of ruptured membranes. The following microbiologic isolates were found in the amniotic fluids: Staphylococcus epidermidis 36.38%, Streptococcus B 12.23%, Streptococcus D 10.3%, Escherichia coli 8.42%, Staphylococcus aureus 7.88%, Peptococci 3.26%, Streptococcus salivarius 2.99%, Bacteroides 2.4%. According to these data, patients with ruptured membranes of an interval of more than 12 hrs and with more than 7 vaginal examinations could be selected for antibiotic prophylaxis to achieve a reduction in febrile morbidity and in wound infection.
TI  - The spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. To a new gold standard.
AB  - Of 282 consecutive ascites prospectively collected in 54 months, Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) was diagnosed in 8.5% of the cases, "probable" SBP in 31.1%, Bacteriascites (BA) in 3.5% and Sterile Ascites (SA) (negative ascitic fluid culture with PMN less than 250/mm3) in 74.8%. Escherichia Coli (41.6%) and Staphylococcus Epidermidis (60%) were the most frequent pathogens isolated in patients with SBP and BA, respectively. With regards to in-hospital mortality, 18% of patients with BA and 50% with SBP died; the mortality seemed to be related to the degree of hepatic and renal damage, to a higher peripheral and ascitic WBC concentration and to a lower pH of ascitic fluid (FA). When the comparative analysis was applied to the four groups of ascites, a different distribution of clinical signs and biohumoral parameters appeared. As a matter of fact, abdominal pain, fever and rebound tenderness resulted significantly more frequent in SBP and "probable" SBP. Furthermore, the mean values of peripheral and ascitic WBC concentration, of serum creatinine and of ALT were statistically higher in SBP and "probable" SBP than in SA and BA groups. The strict relationship, both symptomatologic and biochemical, between SA and BA on the one hand and between "probable" SBP and SBP on the other, prompted us to conclude that "probable" SBP and SBP represent different patterns of the same disease. Therefore, the subclassification in the four groups outlined above would not be in accordance with the clinical practice and could give rise to the physician's confusion and uncertainty.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - Recurrent aortic graft infection following descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. A case report and review.
AB  - This paper presents a patient who developed a recurrent aortic graft infection after a descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. The patient had previously undergone successful management of an infected aortobifemoral bypass by removal of the graft and revascularization of the lower extremities with axillofemoral bypasses. A general discussion of the management of infected aortic grafts is presented and a discussion of the management of this particular patient is presented in detail.
TI  - Surface characteristics and adhesion of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Surface hydrophobicity, surface electrokinetic potential and the ability to adhere to nitric-acid cleansed glass surfaces has been assessed throughout the growth, in batch culture, of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In both instances adhesiveness and surface hydrophobicity decreased in early- to mid-exponential phase. Cell surface charge, on the other hand became more electro-negative for E. coli but electro-neutral for Staph. epidermidis as the cells proceeded to divide. Adhesiveness correlated directly with surface electronegativity and hydrophobicity for Staph. epidermidis but inversely with surface electro-negativity for E. coli.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. Comparison to Escherichia coli.
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and Gram-negative bacteremia. In these studies, heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (LPS)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia and the physiologic abnormalities seen in Gram-negative bacteremia. S. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating TNF and IL-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed Escherichia coli. Circulating IL-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than TNF levels (r = 0.48, P less than 0.02). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either S. epidermidis or E. coli infusion. However, S. epidermidis infusion did not induce significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas E. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. S. epidermidis, E. coli, LPS, or S. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (LTA) induced TNF and IL-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. E. coli organisms and LPS were at least 100-fold more potent than S. epidermidis or LTA. Thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of IL-1 and TNF were observed following either S. epidermidis or E. coli. These data provide further evidence that host factors such as IL-1 and TNF are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Effect of plastic catheter material on bacterial adherence and viability.
AB  - The kinetics of adherence of single isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli to catheters made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Teflon, siliconised latex, polyurethane and Vialon was evaluated by a radiometric assay. Radiolabelled bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) were incubated in vials containing 1-cm lengths of catheter for up to 3 days. The peak of maximal adherence to each biomaterial was reached after 24 h for P. aeruginosa and after 72 h for the other strains. Bacterial adherence to PVC and siliconised latex was significantly higher (2-6 times; p less than 0.05) than to the other biomaterials for all the strains. The lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and Vialon for the staphylococci but with Teflon for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. None of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for E. coli. We conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Characterization of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 from Enterococcus faecalis and comparison to staphylococcal transposons Tn4001 and Tn4031.
AB  - In Enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (Gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pBEM10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. In the current study, this element, termed Tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in E. faecalis UV202. On the basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization studies, Tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in U.S. isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located HindIII (2.5 kb apart), ClaI (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and HaeIII (3.9 kb apart) sites. Restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of Tn5281 generated with HincII, ScaI, and AluI were also consistent with Tn4001 and Tn4031. By using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of Tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of Tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb HaeIII fragment and a 0.7-kb HindIII-HaeIII fragment. The sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like IS256 are present in Tn5281. A 1-kb HaeIII fragment in pBEM10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that Tn5281 in pBEM10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.
TI  - Aztreonam versus gentamicin for short-term prophylaxis in biliary and gastric surgery.
AB  - Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis was studied in 80 patients undergoing biliary or gastric surgery. The patients were randomized to receive 1 g of aztreonam or 80 mg of gentamicin intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. Of samples taken from the abdominal cavity for bacteriologic study, 53% were culture positive. Wound infections developed in two (4.5%) of 44 patients receiving aztreonam and in seven (19.4%) of 36 patients treated with gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter species were isolated from sites of wound infection in the aztreonam group; Escherichia coli (two isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two isolates), Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species, Enterococcus faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from the gentamicin group. Our data indicate that aztreonam is safe and effective for the prevention of infections following biliary and gastric surgery.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - [Neonatal conjunctivitis in a nursery and a neonatal unit].
AB  - After Crede prophylaxis was abandoned at our hospital in 1984 scrupulous clinical surveillance of all neonates for conjunctivitis, and bacterial cultures from purulent eye discharge, have become routine. During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Factors in pin tract infections.
AB  - To determine the factors pertinent to the etiology of pin tract infections, 214 pins in 42 patients were examined prospectively at the time of pin removal. Eighty-nine (41.6%) pin tracts were inflamed, 49 (22.9%) pins had loose anchorages, and 160 (74.8%) pin tips cultured positive for bacteria. The predominant organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (90.6%), considered nonvirulent, followed by virulent Staphylococcus aureus (37.5%), and Escherichia coli (9.4%). There were 32 loose, inflamed pin tracts. This correlation was statistically significant (P less than .005). There were 40 loose pins whose pin tips had positive cultures. Loose pins correlated for infection with virulent species of bacteria at a highly significant level (P less than .005). Results demonstrate that most pins possess bacterial colonization. Clinically, this means that either inflamed pin tracts or pins with cultures positive for invasive organisms are probably loose and should be removed. Also, mechanical factors are the critical variable in determining the flora of external fixation pins.
TI  - [Preliminary investigation of effect of pyocyanin on common bacteria in burn wound].
AB  - Pyocyanin was extracted from culture medium of Ps. aeruginosa by Frank's method.  Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) & minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of pyocyanin for 6 species of bacteria isolated from burn wounds were determined. The results of MIC & MBC: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, 50 micrograms/ml; E. coli 25 micrograms/ml, 100 micrograms/ml; P. vulgaris 50 micrograms/ml, 200 micrograms/ml; C. freundii 100 micrograms/ml, 400 micrograms/ml; S. epidermidis 12.5 micrograms/ml, 50 micrograms/ml; no inhibitory effect on Ps. aeruginosa. According to the laboratory results and clinical findings, the authors believe that when there is a dominant growth of Ps. aeruginosa in burn wounds there may be pyocyanin production to inhibit or kill other species of bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - Epidemiology of beta-lactamases in Africa: correlation with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In 45 centers from eight African countries, 2,888 bacterial isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired infections. Isolated pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Escherichia coli (20%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%), Proteus species (6%), Klebsiella species (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (4%). An overall sensitivity of 16.2% was shown to penicillin G (number of isolates tested = 2,467), 31.8% to ampicillin (2,687), 45% to amoxicillin (1,959), and 84.9% to cefuroxime (2,888). Beta-lactamase presence was measured by a chromogenic method. Beta-lactamase was found in 75% of all pathogens tested, including 69.5% of gram-negative and 83.3% of gram-positive pathogens; 73% of E coli isolates, 76% of N gonorrhoeae, 75% of Klebsiella species, and 84% of S aureus were beta-lactamase positive. Beta-lactamase presence was associated with bacterial resistance for penicillin G, ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but not cefuroxime, whose sensitivity remained high. The higher resistance rates and beta-lactamase prevalence in Africa suggest the need for national antibiotic prescribing policies and surveillance schemes and replacement of relatively ineffective penicillins with newer agents such as cefuroxime.
TI  - [Induced bacterial chemiluminescence].
AB  - Oxygen-peroxide-induced superweak luminescence of some microorganisms has been studied by means of the native chemiluminometer KhLM1Ts-01. It is established that total chemiluminescence decrease in the bacteria as follows: Escherichia coli----Bacillus subtilis----Proteus vulgaris----Bacillus mycoides----B. licheniformis----Pseudomonas aeruginosa----Staphylococcus epidermidis----S. aureus----Serratia marcescens----Salmonella enteritidis. A hypothesis is put forward on a possible mechanisms of appearance of the superweak luminescence of bacteria and expediency to use chemoluminometry to differentiate microorganisms.
TI  - Sonication provides maximal recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis from slime-coated vascular prosthetics.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) prosthetic vascular graft infections  are often difficult to detect. A reliable culture method is needed so that appropriate therapeutic decisions can be initiated in a timely fashion. Sonication of graft material has been proposed as a method of enhancing bacterial recovery. Theoretically, however, this could cause cell lysis and false-negative culture results. Several methods of obtaining bacterial cultures were compared to determine the best method of quantitative bacterial recovery from infected graft material. Polytetrafluoroetehylene (PTFE) and knitted Dacron graft segments (n = 192) were exposed to a slime-producing strain of S. epidermidis or Escherichia coli (E. coli) at four different bacterial concentrations. Recovery of bacteria from the segments was then compared using three different methods to obtain organisms. One-third of the segments were pressed directly onto the agar to transfer bacteria while the other two-thirds were placed in broth and then either sonicated or vortexed prior to plating onto agar. The direct technique was significantly less effective (P less than 0.01) at recovering bacteria than either sonicating or vortexing for both graft materials at bacterial concentrations of 10, 10(2), and 10(4) CFU/ml of S. epidermidis. Sonication was significantly better at recovery from either material at 10(2) and 10(4) CFU/ml of S. epidermidis than vortexing (P less than 0.05). E. coli graft adherence was poor, and significant recovery occurred only at 10(8) CFU/ml. Sonication is necessary to maximally recover S. epidermidis from infected prosthetic grafts.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human peritoneal macrophages from patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Peritoneal macrophages (PM) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of bacterial peritonitis, the main complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We determined the antibacterial activity of PM from 31 PD patients using gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) test organisms. In an 8-hour test assay, PM revealed the highest antibacterial activity against E. coli [median bactericidal index (Bi) = 5.46 representing 0.74 log growth inhibition compared to controls] and the lowest against P. aeruginosa (Bi = 1.63, 0.21 log growth inhibition, p less than 0.05). The antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Bi = 1.99, 0.3 log growth inhibition) and S. epidermidis (Bi = 2.0, 0.31 log growth inhibition) was within this range. When compared to peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PM reached only 4% (S. aureus) and 8.1% (E. coli) of their antibacterial activity (p less than 0.05). Using E. coli as a test organism, PM isolated after a 4-hour dialysis period revealed the highest antibacterial activity when compared to PM isolated after longer dialysis periods (p less than 0.05). Increasing the duration of PD to 6 and 8 h subsequently decreased the antibacterial activity of PM, suggesting that unphysiologic concentrations of toxic metabolites in the peritoneal effluent might have a harmful influence on PM functions.
TI  - Recovery of S. epidermidis and E. coli from effluent peritoneal dialysate.
AB  - The effect of incubation temperature and duration was studied on the growth of organisms in peritoneal dialysate effluent. Penicillin-sensitive, and gentamicin-sensitive clinical isolates of S. epidermidis (SE) and E. Coli (EC), respectively, were inoculated into freshly drained dialysate of 19 CAPD patients who did not have peritonitis. Each dialysate was 1.5% dextrose in strength and had a minimum dwell of 6 hours. Control and test aliquots were incubated at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C for periods of up to 12 hours, and samples collected and plated to determine colony counts. Initial counts at time zero were 9.4 x 10(4) (SE) and 6.6 x 10(3) (EC) CFU/ml. SE showed no change in count at 4 or 20 degrees C up to 12 hours. There was a significant increase (p less than 0.005) at 37 degrees C, at 12 hours to 1.72 x 10(6) CFU/ml. EC showed no change at 4 or 20 degrees C. There was a significant decrease in count for EC at 37 degrees C, 6 hours (5.5 x 10(2) CFU/ml, p less than 0.01) and 37 degrees, 12 hours (2.9 x 10(2) CFU/ml, p less than 0.0001). It is recommended that infected dialysate should be stored in cool conditions until it can be transported for culture to ensure adequate recovery of gram negative organisms.
TI  - The viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  - In 1988 the University of Wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. This solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. In addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. Prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. However, there are no data on whether UW solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. We undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in UW solution at extended preservation times. Cultures of both aerobic (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (Bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 Macfarland turbidity standard) in both Eurocollins and UW preservation solutions. Samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. The organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. The samples were then incubated at 37 degrees C and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. Our results showed growth of all organisms except S epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. S epi grew in the Eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the UW solution. When the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the UW solution, S epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. These results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in UW solution with extended preservation times. It may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the UW solution and obtain similar results. It is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - Purification of equine neutrophil lysozyme and its antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The lysozyme lysed Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. The lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for Gram-positive as well as for Gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. Equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. Both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against M. luteus membranes.
TI  - Septicemia in patients with hematological disorders and neutropenia. A retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profile.
AB  - In order to identify the cause of septicemia and the resistance patterns of bacteria in Swedish patients with hematological disorders, all positive blood cultures collected at a hematological ward during 1980-1986 were evaluated retrospectively. 198 episodes of septicemia in 129 patients were recorded. 54% were males and 46% women with a median age of 67 years (range 16-88). Patients with acute leukemia (46%), lymphoma (19%) and myeloma (19%) dominated. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was less than 0.5 x 10(9)/l in 76% of the bacteremic episodes. A total of 253 consecutive isolates were found with 53% Gram-negatives and 47% Gram-positives. The dominating pathogens were Escherichia coli (27%), klebsiella/enterobacter (15%), pseudomonas (7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (13%), alpha-streptococci (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and anaerobes (6%). Coagulase negative staphylococci showed a significant increase in isolation rate during the study period. The majority of E. coli were resistant to ampicillin. The susceptibility of klebsiella/enterobacter to ceftazidime and cefuroxime was reduced, while no imipenem resistant strains occurred. Among coagulase negative staphylococci 61% were resistant to isoxazolylpenicillin, none to vancomycin. No dramatic changes in the etiology of septicemia or the susceptibility pattern during the study period were noticed. Coagulase negative staphylococci, S. epidermidis in particular, constitute an increasing problem among granulocytopenic patients.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of three glycols, - propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol - against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Streptococcus mitis, and E. coli were studied in vitro. Within 20 h, 10% and 30% hexylene glycol in fresh tryptic soy broth were able to kill all the micro-organisms listed above. Five percent hexylene glycol showed some antimicrobial properties but the 1% agent had no effect. Thirty percent 1,3-butylene glycol and 30% propylene glycol were approximately as effective as 10% HG. The results speak in favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and dermatological vehicles instead of propylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol.
TI  - Bactericidal effectiveness of modulated UV light.
AB  - Studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of pulsed modulated UV light  waveforms for killing bacteria. Exposure of five strains of bacteria to the modulated information encoded in the light decreased the colony population from a confluent lawn to less than 20 colonies. However, approximately 2,000 colonies survived treatment with the same intensity and time of exposure to UV light lacking the modulated information.
TI  - A prospective study of nosocomial infections in cardiac surgery patients in China.
AB  - A prospective survey of postoperative nosocomial infections (NI) in cardiac surgery was carried out in a cardiovascular specialty hospital in Beijing, China. During the period from December 1986 to December 1987, 1208 cardiovascular surgery patients were surveyed for NI. The overall incidence of NI was found to be 7.5%. The incidence of lower respiratory tract and wound infections were 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively. These two kinds of infection accounted for 78.1% of the total infections. After effective control measures were taken at the end of the first 6 months (December 1986 to May 1987) of the study, the incidence fell from 10.6% to 5.1% in the next 7-month period (June to December 1987). The pathogens causing NI were mostly gram-negative bacteria, and they were mainly opportunistic. The contribution of fungal infection was significant in the hospitals. The majority of the pathogenic isolates were highly resistant to the antibiotics commonly used in the hospital.
TI  - Mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  - Unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of Escherichia coli KL16 and Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal DNA. Since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of EDTA, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its DNA, but Staphylococcus epidermidis SK360 and Staph. aureus E3T, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. This suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. Zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Intraarticular osmic acid in postinfectious arthritis persisting after treated bacterial arthritis.
AB  - We describe 4 patients successfully treated with intraarticular osmic acid for post-infectious arthritis persisting after apparent eradication of bacteria from the infected joint. In addition the bactericidal effect of osmic acid in vitro is demonstrated. We conclude that treatment with osmic acid carries no risk of iatrogenic infection; on the contrary, an antibacterial effect seems likely.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Synthesis of 3-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The synthesis of some 3-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine derivatives is performed by reacting 2-(3-amino-1,2-dihydro-5-oxo-5H-pyrazol-4-il)-1,3,4- thiadiazoles with 2,4-pentanedione, ethyl 3-oxobutyrate and diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds is reported.
TI  - The effect of protein and urine on uropathogen adhesion to polymer substrata.
AB  - Uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. Experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), Tamm Horsfall protein (THP), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. The results showed that THP did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coli. However, the THP did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, Proteus mirabilis. Incubation of the uropathogens in THP and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. The results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and infection control policies in Australia.
AB  - The pattern of neonatal bacterial infection, its management and the types of infection control policy were ascertained in 20 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Australia by questionnaire survey. Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli were the predominant organisms responsible for perinatally acquired infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Penicillin and Gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus (majority Methicillin resistant) were the predominant organisms responsible for nosocomial infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Vancomycin and Cefotaxime. A Serratia epidemic was experienced in four NICU. Lumbar and suprapubic punctures were frequently done as part of the diagnostic workup in nosocomial infections but not with perinatally acquired infections. Haematological indices considered useful as a diagnosis aid varied between NICU and acute phase reactants were rarely relied upon for diagnosis or for monitoring treatment response. Granulocyte transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins were infrequently used in therapy. No consensus was found on infection control policies. Eight NICU required routine gowning on entry, two restricted sibling visiting and four restricted visiting by relatives and friends. Although routine bacteriological surveillance on staff or equipment was uncommon, serial cultures were carried out in infants from the body surface in six NICU and from the endotracheal aspirate in 17 NICU. Antiseptics used with technical procedures included iodine, chlorhexidine and alcohol used singly or in combination. Skin and umbilical cord care also varied between NICU. The literature was reviewed to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the existing policies in the prevention or management of neonatal infection to encourage consensus towards a more rational approach to neonatal infection in Australia.
TI  - Role of Bacteroides uniformis in susceptibility of Ta:CF# 1 mice to infection by  Treponema hyodysenteriae.
AB  - Among the various strains and colonies of mice tested specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Ta:CF#1 mice exhibited the highest susceptibility to Treponema hyodysenteriae infection. Staphylococcus epidermidis 1047, Streptococcus faecalis 2039, Lactobacillus murinus 3010, Escherichia coli 1049, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3008 were administered to the Ta:CF#1 mice. B. uniformis IK, which appeared to colonize in the breeding facility under SPF conditions, was isolated from the cecal content of a Ta:CF#1 mouse and identified in the mouse flora. Germfree mice were infected with these six bacteria and challenged with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 to elucidate the causal relationship between these bacteria and the sensitivity of mice to T. hyodysenteriae infection. No cecal lesions were observed in gnotobiotic mice either monoassociated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 or B. uniformis IK or inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with the 5 a.m. strains. Gross cecal lesions appeared only in mice inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with B. uniformis IK. A new SPF mouse colony (CF#1/b Ta) established from gnotobiotic mice by inoculation with B. uniformis IK and the 5 laboratory stock cultures was as susceptible to T. hyodysenteriae as the original Ta:CF#1 mice. This suggests that B. uniformis IK plays an important role in the high susceptibility of Ta:CF#1 mice to T.hyodysenteriae.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pWBG637 from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmids pWBG636 (GmR) and pWBG642 (EmR) derived from the conjugative plasmid pWBG637 were tested for ability to transfer conjugatively to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Both plasmids transferred to S. epidermidis and Strept. faecalis but not to B. subtilis and E. coli. Once in S. epidermis and Strept. faecalis they were transferred back to S. aureus. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the plasmids were stably maintained in S epidermidis and Strept. faecalis.
TI  - [The binding of microorganisms isolated from patients with complicated forms of acute cholecystitis with immobilized proteins in the bacterial sorption reaction].
AB  - 57 strains of different microbial species, isolated from patients having complicated forms of acute cholecystitis, were studied with the use of the reaction of bacteriosorption on immobilized proteins: fibrinogen, fibronectin, gamma globulin, ovalbumin, etc. The reaction of bacteriosorption was positive with all 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains: they were adsorbed on fibrinogen, fibronectin and gamma globulin. Besides, 4 out of 18 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were selectively adsorbed on fibronectin and 1 of these strains was adsorbed on ovalbumin, while 2 out of 15 Escherichia coli strains were adsorbed on ovalbumin. S. epidermidis strains studied in this work differed from 15 strains of the same species, isolated from the urine of patients and studied earlier, by their adsorption properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial actions of calcium binding leucocyte L1 protein, calprotectin.
AB  - The calcium binding L1 protein was found to inhibit growth of blood culture isolates of Candida spp and cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 4-128 mg/l, and concentrations 2-4 times the MIC were fungicidal. Blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had MIC values of 64-256 mg/l. Antibacterial activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the culture medium. In view of the biological activity of L1, the name calprotectin is proposed to describe this antimicrobial protein with calcium binding properties.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion of NFLX after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. The mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. The mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. The mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. A dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of NFLX were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. In 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Escherichia coli 10 strains, Salmonella sp. 5 strains, Morganella morganii 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and Campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. Bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of C. jejuni only decreased. With regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. No abnormal laboratory test data were observed. From the above results, NFLX was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bactericidal action of PD127,391, an enhanced spectrum quinolone.
AB  - The 4-quinolone PD127,391 displays a biphasic effect on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis in nutrient broth. It is as active as ciprofloxacin in terms of its optimum bactericidal concentration against E. coli. However, against staphylococci it is six times as active as ciprofloxacin or any other 4-quinolone previously investigated. Although protein and RNA synthesis are not required for bactericidal activity, cell division is essential.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Separation of sublethal and lethal effects of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli ingested by PMN promptly stop growing and form no colonies in nutrient agar, but metabolize near normally for up to several hours. The bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) of PMN also inhibits E. coli growth without initial metabolic impairment. We recently showed that BPI-treated E. coli, although unable to grow in normal nutrient agar, can form colonies in this medium plus 0.1% BSA, as long as their metabolism is maintained, indicating that biochemical impairment is a better indicator of death than growth arrest (1990. J. Clin. Invest. 85:853-860). We have now reexamined the fate of ingested E. coli. Rabbit PMN ingest greater than 85% of several rough E. coli strains in 15 min, but greater than 80% of these bacteria, while unable to form colonies in conventional agar, grow normally on agar plus 0.1% BSA. Thus, the PMN under these conditions promptly stop growth of ingested E. coli without killing. Adding nonlethal concentrations of normal human serum (NHS) before, but not after ingestion, accelerates killing and, in parallel, loss of bacterial metabolism (t1/2 less than 0.5 h vs. greater than 3 h, respectively, with and without NHS). The rapid killing of both rough and smooth E. coli pretreated with NHS is lost after C7 depletion (C7-D) and restored when C7 is replenished. Similar results are obtained with human PMN. In contrast, ingested Staphylococcus epidermidis, opsonized with either NHS or C7-D serum rapidly stop metabolizing and do not form colonies in nutrient agar with or without BSA. Respiratory burst activity is the same during ingestion of E. coli (with or without NHS) and S. epidermidis. Killing of E. coli J5 (however, not of O111-B4) by BPI is also accelerated by pretreatment with NHS but not C7-D human serum. These findings indicate that late complement components are needed for efficient killing of both rough and smooth E. coli by PMN, and that BPI is the principal intracellular agent acting on ingested rough E. coli.
TI  - Antiviral and antibacterial lipids in human milk and infant formula feeds.
AB  - Human milk and two infant formula feeds were tested for antiviral and antibacterial activity before being given to 21 low birthweight (LBW) infants; neither was present. When samples were aspirated from the stomachs of the infants within one to three hours of feeding, however, they reduced titres of enveloped virus and also killed both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. The lipid fraction of the gastric aspirate from an infant who had been given human milk as well as those from four infants who had been given a conventional LBW infant formula feed, showed antiviral and antibacterial activities at least equal to the activities of the unfractionated aspirates. There was no consistent difference in antiviral or antibacterial activity of either the stomach aspirates or the lipid fractions of these aspirates between infants given human milk and those given formula feeds. The antiviral and antibacterial activities of the gastric aspirates seem to result from intragastric production of monoglycerides and fatty acids from the triglyceride content of the ingested feeds.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - Parenteral fluoroquinolones in children with life-threatening infections.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones have not been tested in children despite their wide spectrum of in vitro activity and efficacy, because of an observed damage to cartilage in young animals. However, in some cases they may be life-saving. We present three pediatric patients with life threatening infections in whom the fluoroquinolones were used when other antibiotics failed: A seven-year-old boy with meningitis due to multiresistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a three-year-old boy with Job's syndrome with line sepsis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and a four month-old boy with agammaglobulinemia with mixed infection due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. All three children were cured of their infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. LJC10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. The MICs of this compound for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. LJC10,627 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at an MIC90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. This compound inhibited Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species at MIC90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. LJC10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at MIC90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against Bacteroides fragilis at an MIC90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. LJC10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for Xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type II. LJC10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase I; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. Killing kinetics of this compound for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the MIC (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). LJC10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1B(s) of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The pathogenesis of urinary tract infections associated with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and S. epidermidis.
AB  - A model was developed in mice to study the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains LM-1 and LM-2, Escherichia coli SP444 and S. epidermidis E001. Murine urinary bladders were inoculated with 10(8) bacteria via a temporary urinary catheter and samples of urine and bladder were removed at days 1, 3, 5 and 10 after inoculation. They were examined both bacteriologically and by electronmicroscopy. Severe disruption of the urothelium was present immediately and the urothelium had become oedematous and ulcerated with increased urothelial exfoliation. Disruption of the urothelium was similar with all the four pathogens studied. The three strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci preferentially attached to the urothelial cell tight junctions and were not associated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes. In comparison, E. coli SP444 was randomly attached over the entire urothelium and was often in association with macrophages. Phagocytosis of E. coli by superficial urothelial cells also occurred.
TI  - A new approach to optimal antibiotic dosage regimen by coupling pharmacokinetics  and killing curve parameters.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is directed against bacteria responsible for infectious pathology which are able to resist treatment mainly when the dosage is misadapted. The choice of the initial dosage regimen actually takes into account toxicological, bacteriological and pharmacokinetic parameters. The determination of the classical bacteriological data is performed in vitro using fixed drug concentrations that are far from human therapy conditions, and moreover the efficiency is not well defined. The estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters is realized in animals, healthy subjects or ill patients but takes into account only the drug disposition without correspondence with the kinetics of the antibiotic effect on the bacteria. Thus, each type of evaluation is made independently from the others without any correlation between the observed phenomena. It appears, therefore, interesting to propose a new approach including pharmacokinetic and bacteriological data to enable approximation of drug efficacy. The coupled evaluation of individual pharmacokinetic estimation and the killing curve determinations of an antibiotic will allow this type of development. On the basis of these data, a preliminary profile of the optimal dosage would be possible. This methodology has been applied to three antibiotics: teicoplanin, amikacin and ofloxacin and demonstrates a time- or dose-dependent activity, with interesting possibilities for optimization of dosage.
TI  - Oral pefloxacin mesylate in the treatment of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis associated peritonitis: an open non-comparative study.
AB  - Twenty-two (15 female and 7 male) patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal  dialysis (CAPD) associated peritonitis were entered into an open non-comparative evaluation of oral pefloxacin mesylate. An initial loading dose of 800 mg was followed by 400 mg twice daily. Five patients were subsequently excluded or withdrawn. The mean age of the patients was 44 +/- 12.6 years. All three Gram-negative infections (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Serratia liquefaciens) and all three culture negative infections were cured after 21 days treatment. In contrast one of four (25%) Staphylococcus aureus infections was cured, two persisted during treatment and one relapsed, after treatments of between 10 and 25 days. One of seven (14%) Staph. epidermidis infections was cured, three persisted and three relapsed after treatments of between nine and 25 days. Two of the five persistent isolates became resistant: all four relapsed isolates remained sensitive. Twelve of the 22 (55%) patients had 16 side effects, most commonly skin or musculo-skeletal. Three stopped pefloxacin because of them, though one had taken an excessive dose in error. Pefloxacin mesylate is not optimal treatment for Gram-positive coccal peritonitis in patients on CAPD, but its role in Gram-negative disease needs further evaluation.
TI  - [Neonatal septicemia: differences in full-term and pre-term newborn infants].
AB  - Neonatal septicemia was assessed by blood cultures in 115 newborns (NB) during a  two years study in a pediatric hospital of reference in Mexico City. The studied patients were divided in two groups of gestational age, and the differences of etiologic agents, clinical signs, laboratory findings and clinical outcome were compared at term and preterm neonates. We observed Staphylococcus epidermidis became the first cause of septicemia in at term NB (P less than 0.001), while Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than 0.01) were more frequent in the preterm neonates. The clinical manifestations of fever (P less than 0.001), hepatomegaly (P less than 0.01), splenomegaly (P less than 0.05), and rejection to feeding (P less than 0.05) were more common in at term NB. On the other hand, apneas (P less than 0.01), hypothermia (P less than 0.02), and abdominal distension (P less than 0.05) were more frequent in the preterm NB. The altered white blood cell counts were more commonly observed in the preterm group, as leukopenia (P less than 0.05), neutropenia (P less than 0.01), and high I/T ratio (P less than 0.05). There were not significant differences in complications or sequels between the two groups; however, the mortality ratio was higher in the preterm NB group (P less than 0.02). Changing etiology of neonatal septicemia is discussed, and we propose these kind of data are very useful for purpose of detection, diagnostic and treatment of septic neonates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - [Development of resistance to antibiotic therapy at a polyvalent intensive care unit during 3 years].
AB  - The antibiotherapy resistance evolution and the appearance of new enterobacter in our ICU's flora have been studied. A total of 638 bacterial samples were studied. The most frequent isolated pathogens were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (182 strands), Escherichia coli (108 strands), Staphylococcus epidermidis (99 strands) and Staphylococcus aureus (41 strands). These four types of bacteria have been used to evaluate the antibiotic resistance variations over a period of time, which have only been significant for Pseudomonas with an increased number of amikamicine's resistant strands after the second year (p less than 0.001) and the of one multiresistant strand to piperaciline and amikamicine this second year, and four (8%) the year after. There are not significant differences in the resistance of E. Coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis over this period of time. We have not observed new enterobacter strands over the time this study was performed although a higher incidence of Serratia (p less than 0.05) and Enterobacter (p less than 0.05) have been detected between the first and the third year, respectively.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Cloning and restriction analysis of DNA conferring new quinolone antimicrobial agent resistance from Staphylococcus aureus and other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species.
AB  - DNA conferring resistance to new quinolone antimicrobial agents (NQR) in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, was analyzed after cloning in Escherichia coli. The NQR phenotypes were expressed in E. coli at lower levels. NQR gene(s)-carring HindIII fragments were very similar to each other among S. aureus or CNS, although the S. aureus fragments differed from the CNS fragments in terms of the NQR phenotypes and restriction endonuclease maps. The data suggest the possibility that the NQR genes have disseminated in evolutionarily distinct routes among S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Glycocalyx positive bacteria isolated from chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.
AB  - Bacterial cultures isolated from cases of chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis were screened for the production of glycocalyx. The presence of glycocalyx was noted in 76.3% of Staphylococcus aureus, 57.14% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 50% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 75% of Escherichia coli isolates.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of the main opportunistic pathogenic aerobic bacteria].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 1421 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. was studied. Gentamicin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin proved to be the antibiotics of choice in treatment of purulent inflammatory diseases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus. For antibiotic therapy of infections caused by gram-negative organisms gentamicin and polymixin might be recommended.
TI  - The phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
AB  - The toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenus gr. A, St. viridans, Pityrosporum ovale and Candida albicans were studied. P. ovale and St. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. P. ovale inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli. St. viridans inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli, St. pyogenus gr. A and P. ovale. This effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. The activity was increased by UVA on S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Ps. aeruginosa but not on E. coli and St. pyogenes gr. A. These effects of P. ovale and St. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
TI  - Nosocomial sepsis associated with interleukin-2.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, clinical magnitude, and risk factors for nosocomial bacteremia in patients given interleukin-2 with or without (+/-) lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells for cancer immunotherapy. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Clinical study unit of tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: All patients entering the interleukin-2 +/- LAK cancer immunotherapy protocol during a 28-month period. Control groups were patients in a surgical intensive care unit, patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, and patients with solid tumors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of 107 (19%) interleukin-2-treated patients developed sepsis; in 12 of these patients, sepsis was intravenous catheter-associated. The bacteremia rate among patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, in the surgical intensive care unit, or having solid tumors was 2.8%, 4.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in 13 courses; Staphylococcus epidermidis, in 5; and Escherichia coli, in 2. Two patients died; three developed suppurative thrombophlebitis; one developed septic arthritis; one, septic arterial aneurysm; and one, peritonitis with probable meningitis. Colonization with S. aureus increased the risk of S. aureus bacteremia 6.3-fold (95% CI, 2.8 to 14.5; P less than 0.001); skin desquamation at the catheter site increased the relative risk 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1; P = 0.031). Both colonization with S. aureus and skin desquamation increased the relative risk of S. aureus bacteremia 14.5-fold (95% CI, 4.1 to 50.9; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal bacteremia is more frequent in patients receiving interleukin-2 therapy and is associated with substantial morbidity and toxic skin reactions.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - [Cefpiramide: antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, and clinical evaluation].
AB  - We determined MIC values of cefpiramide (CPM) against clinical isolates from 100  patients who were subjected to total hysterectomy between April 1986 and March 1988. We also investigated the concentrations of CPM in uterine tissue and assessed the clinical efficacy of postoperative prophylaxis. 1. Against bacteria isolated from clinical materials the MIC80 values of CPM were as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 1.56 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecalis 25 micrograms/ml, and Escherichia coli 6.25 micrograms/ml. 2. Peak concentrations of CPM in various tissues and tissue/serum ratios of AUC were as follows: cervix uteri 35 micrograms/g (39.5%), perimetrium 43 micrograms/g (44.9%), endometrium 39 micrograms/g (51.6%), myometrium 28 micrograms/g (26.8%), oviduct 67 micrograms/g (41.9%), and ovary 27 micrograms/g (45.8%). In all tissues examined CPM concentrations were above 4 micrograms/g after 600 minutes. 3. Serum half-lives were T 1/2(alpha) = 13.2 minutes and T 1/2(beta) = 260.2 minutes. 4. The efficacy rate in postoperative prophylaxis was 97.9%. 5. No serious side effects were observed.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of zinc oxide in vitro.
AB  - Antibacterial activity, zinc concentrations and pH were measured in Muller-Hinton broth containing different amounts of zinc oxide and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (10(6) colony forming units/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of zinc oxide to different clinical isolates were determined using the Muller-Hinton agar dilution tests. Gram-positive bacteria were most susceptible. Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and streptococci were usually not inhibited even at the highest concentrations used (1024 micrograms/ml), but staphylococci--particularly some isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis--were sensitive enough to allow determination of their MIC.
TI  - External eye flora as a nutrient source for Acanthamoeba.
AB  - Certain bacteria cause excystment of Acanthamoeba from cyst to trophozoite form and are then ingested by migrating trophozoites. We studied the response of Acanthamoeba cysts to inoculation on agar seeded with three types of commensal eye bacteria and Escherichia coli. Amoebae excysted on all bacteria tested, and the migration rate of Acanthamoeba trophozoites on each was compared. Acanthamoeba migrated with equal speed on E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Migration was observed, but was more slow on Micrococcus and Corynebacterium. Commensal bacteria on the eyelids, conjunctiva and tear film may have a role in pathogenesis of Acanthamoeba keratitis.
TI  - [Incidence of nosocomial infections in an cancer center: clinical and bacteriologic data].
AB  - Over a 5 month period, a study of the incidence of nosocomial infections (NI) was carried out in the Leon Berard Oncology Center (Lyons). It comprised 1,551 patients classified in groups according to the site of origin of the underlying malignancy. The respective frequency of the different types of nosocomial infections and the responsible agents was evaluated in each group and the incidence was calculated per day of hospitalization. The overall incidence of NI was 11.29 per 1,000 patient-days, with a maximal value of 20.04 for patients suffering from lymphomas. The most frequently encountered infections were bacteremias (22.7%), followed by urinary tract infections (20.8%) and wound infections (20.5%). The most frequent causative agents of NI were Escherichia coli (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.8%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.8%). The latter micro-organism together with Escherichia coli were the most frequent causative agents of bacteremias. Even though cancer patients are particularly prone to developing infections, the incidence of NI could be reduced thanks to a program of control and surveillance of infectious episodes during hospitalization.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of urine and the clinical course of pyelonephritis in patients with multiple myeloma].
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic activity of natural products: 1. Propolis.
AB  - Material extracted from propolis (bee glue) by alkaline aqueous solvents or organic solvents showed weak inhibitory activity in vitro against certain species of Gram-positive bacteria. No antimicrobial activity was detected in urine from three volunteers who had taken 500 mg propolis three times a day for 3 days.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activity of cefpirome and cefotaxime against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Using a broth microtiter dilution method, minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined for the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins cefpirome and cefotaxime against 436 blood culture isolates. At concentrations of less than or equal to 16 mg/l, cefpirome inhibited 82.3% of the isolates and cefotaxime 66.5%. At the same concentrations, cefpirome killed 60.0% of the isolates and cefotaxime 46.7%. Whereas the MIC values indicated a far better activity of cefpirome than cefotaxime against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MBC values showed a poor activity of both drugs against these strains. By comparison, cefpirome was the more active agent, covering a similar spectrum to that of cefotaxime with a slight additional activity against oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Exclusion of uropathogen adhesion to polymer surfaces by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is a major cause of concern in the  use of biomaterial substrates. The adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1938 was examined using image analysis and was found not to correlate with polymer surface tension, unlike that of Lactobacillus acidophilus, which adhered to more hydrophobic polymers. A fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli strain showed very low levels of adherence to the biomaterials. Precoating the polymers with lactobacilli significantly reduced the staphylococcal and E. coli adhesion, a result which could have clinical significance. An additional finding was that the interaction of staphylococci and E. coli with lactobacilli coated polymers altered the adhesion profile of the latter. Lactobacilli appeared to detach from polymers of low surface tension and reattach to polymers with high surface tensions. This resulted in the highest levels of exclusion of uropathogens being found for lactobacilli-coated glass and sulfonated polystyrene, both of which are hydrophilic (with high surface tensions). These results demonstrate that lactobacilli can be used to coat biomaterial surfaces leading to a reduced adhesion of uropathogens.
TI  - Surface phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli by human  neutrophils: serum requirements for opsonization and chemiluminescence.
AB  - We examined the serum requirements for surface phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli and for the subsequent chemiluminescent response of human neutrophils. Substantial surface phagocytosis of S. epidermidis occurred in the absence of opsonins, although the presence of 10% pooled or heat-inactivated serum significantly increased phagocytosis. There was no significant difference between these opsonins, indicating that surface phagocytosis of S. epidermidis did not require complement. Unopsonized E. coli were not as readily phagocytized as S. epidermidis (33% versus 57%). In contrast to S. epidermidis optimal phagocytosis of E. coli required complement as 10% heat inactivated donor serum (HHS) was significantly less effective as an opsonin than 10% pooled healthy donor serum (PHS). The time kinetics for phagocytosis of each organism were similar, with most of the phagocytosis occurring in the first 10 min. The chemiluminescent response of neutrophils produced discrepant results. Maximal chemiluminescence was observed when neutrophils were stimulated with bacteria opsonized in PHS. The response to HHS-opsonized bacteria was less, and chemiluminescence to unopsonized bacteria was only marginally higher than the control, even though there was relatively good phagocytosis. These results define the opsonic requirements for surface phagocytosis of S. epidermidis and E. coli and indicate that although complement may not be required for phagocytosis, it is necessary for generation of a maximal oxidative burst, and thus may be essential for efficient intracellular killing.
TI  - [Impact of infections on mortality in children with cancer].
AB  - A study of the role infections play in the death of 29 children with cancer was conducted from 1983 to 1988. An infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of their death. The most frequently found etiological agents found in hemocultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp and Candida spp. A retrospective study on the role of infections in the death of children with cancer was conducted. The clinical and autopsy records of 29 children who died between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. Infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of death. The most frequent etiologic agents found in blood cultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial usage and microbial resistance in a university hospital during a seven-year period.
AB  - The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus and Escherichia coli isolated in a university hospital, and the usage of antimicrobial agents within and outside the hospital was established for a seven-year period. The overall resistance to antimicrobial agents increased markedly for Staph. epidermidis but remained constant for the two other species. In Staph. epidermidis, a pronounced increase was seen in prevalence of resistance to penicillin, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, whereas resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline decreased. The trends in usage of beta-lactam antibiotics were identical within and outside hospital as opposed to the use of erythromycin and sulphonamides. The highest degree of correlation between antimicrobial usage and resistance to an antimicrobial was obtained using a corrected figure for antimicrobial usage paying regard not only to the use of a particular antimicrobial agent but also to a fraction of the usage of other antimicrobials which may co-select for the resistance trait.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Evaluation of pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of thirty-nine cases of chronic osteomyelitis.
AB  - From October 1983 to October 1986, 39 patients with chronic osteomyelitis (of at  least two month's duration) were treated with either pefloxacin (n = 15), ofloxacin (n = 17), or ciprofloxacin (n = 7). The length of treatment ranged from 3 to 6 months; follow-up examinations were performed up until July 1988. The infecting bacterial strains (19 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 Escherichia coli, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were all sensitive to the quinolone prescribed. Twenty-nine of the 38 evaluable patients had a satisfactory outcome at follow-up examinations 14 to 48 months after the end of treatment. Fourteen of the 21 patients with gram-positive bacterial infections responded satisfactorily, as did 15 of the 17 patients infected by gram-negative bacteria. Nine cases of failure were observed (2 for pefloxacin, 4 for ofloxacin, 3 for ciprofloxacin). The infecting bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin). The infecting bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ofloxacin), Escherichia coli (pefloxacin), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pefloxacin) in one case each. In all these cases, local conditions (presence of a foreign body in 5 cases, sequestra in 3, and post-radiotherapy necrosis in 1) could have been responsible for treatment failure. Tolerance was good; adverse effects observed in the pefloxacin and ofloxacin groups disappeared after treatment was ended. Bone levels varied but were always superior to the MIC for the pathogen. In view of the satisfactory results, the possibility of oral administration, and the good tolerance, these quinolones should be considered as alternative agents for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.
TI  - In vitro bacteriological study of a new hub model for intravascular catheters and infusion equipment.
AB  - We investigated in vitro the antibacterial properties of a simulated new hub model in which the female part has an antiseptic chamber through which the needle (male part) must pass before connection of the set and the catheter. To establish the time needed for disinfection, the magnitude of reduction of the contaminating inocula by the new hub model, and the antibacterial properties of the different components of the hub, we used needles contaminated with solutions containing high inocula (1.9 x 10(7) to 1.2 x 10(11) CFU/ml) of microorganisms involved in hub-related catheter sepsis. Sterilization of the needles was accomplished by allowing them to remain in the antiseptic chamber for 10 s in all assays with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The rubber closures limiting the antiseptic chamber and the dilution effect of the antiseptic itself accounted for a minor part of the inoculum reduction achieved by the new hub model. This simulated hub provides good protection against endoluminal contamination. Further studies seem warranted to prove its industrial viability and clinical efficacy.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. Swedish Study Group.
AB  - In the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. Sixty-six patients (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. Five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d. for 5-29 days (median nine days). Three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days after the first dose. One third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately severe in 33 of the patients. Fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. The immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among the aerobic microorganisms isolated Escherichia coli (46 strains) Staphylococcus epidermidis (22 strains), Streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). Thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. E. coli and B. fragilis gave rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against S. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against S. milleri in two cases and against E. faecalis in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Tazobactam prevention of emergence of resistance.
AB  
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The bactericidal activity of DR-3355, an optically active isomer of ofloxacin.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of compound DR-3355, an optically active isomer of ofloxacin, was measured against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, in nutrient broth and in phosphate-buffered saline. DR-3355 was found to be approximately twice as active as ofloxacin in terms of the concentration at which maximum bacterial kill was achieved. Hence it appears that DR-3355 is twice as active as ofloxacin not only in terms of its ability to inhibit bacterial multiplication but also in its ability to kill bacteria. DR-3355 was found to be active against non-dividing bacteria and did not require either active RNA or protein biosynthesis in order to kill bacteria.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically-isolated problem pathogenic bacteria to broad spectrum antibiotics].
AB  - The action of broad-spectrum antibiotics investigated by disc diffusion method on 636 problem bacteria such as S. aureus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, E. coli, Proteus that isolated from various clinical specimens. The highest and lowest ratio of susceptibility were as follows: S. aureus were found sensitive 90% to Netilmicin, 27% to Piperacillin, Enterobacter species 78% to Netilmicin, 25% to Piperacillin, Klebsiella 69% to Amikacin, 20% to Piperacillin, Pseudomonas 66% to Amikacin, 5% to Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid, E.coli 68% to Netilmicin and Ceftriaxone, 32% to Piperacillin, Proteus 70% to Netilmicin, 43% to Piperacillin, S.epidermidis 90% to Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid, 60% to Piperacillin.
TI  - Specific binding of bone sialoprotein to Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with osteomyelitis.
AB  - Bone sialoprotein is selectively bound by Staphylococcus aureus cells isolated from patients suffering from infections of bone tissue [Ryden, C., Maxe, I., Franzen, A., Ljungh, A., Heinegard, D. & Rubin, K. (1987) Lancet II, 514]. In the present communication the binding of bone sialoprotein to staphylococcal cells is characterized in more detail. 125I-Labelled bone sialoprotein bound to suspended staphylococcal cells in a time-dependent, saturable and reversible manner. Binding was inhibited by unlabelled bone sialoprotein and by an amino-terminal CNBr fragment of bone sialoprotein that did not contain the eukaryotic cell-binding site. Binding was furthermore inhibited by lysates obtained from Escherichia coli lysogens carrying a lambda gt11 phage-encoding bone sialoprotein. In contrast, binding was not inhibited by a bacterial lysate from an osteopontin lambda gt11 lysogen, nor by N-linked oligosaccharide isolated from bone sialoprotein or by proteoglycan from rat chondrosarcoma containing clustered O-linked oligosaccharides of the same structure as those of bone sialoprotein. These results indicate that the major staphylococcal-binding site resides in the bone sialoprotein core protein and not in the carbohydrate side chains. No inhibition of bone sialoprotein binding could be detected for whole human serum or purified plasma proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen and IgG. Likewise, staphylococcal protein A or rat collagen type I did not inhibit the binding of bone sialoprotein. The latter results indicate that the binding site for bone sialoprotein on staphylococcal cells was not any of the hitherto described staphylococcal cell-surface proteins. Binding data indicated an average of 1000 bone-sialoprotein-binding sites/bacterial cell.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of meropenem and interactions with other antibiotics.
AB  - MICs of meropenem for selected clinical isolates of bacteria were determined. Killing curves were performed on strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Acinetobacter spp. A reduction of greater than or equal to 3 x log10 in viable cells was observed at 4 and 6 h of exposure to 4 and 8 x MIC, and this was usually maintained at 24 h (with a few exceptions for methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis and Ent. cloacae). At the MIC and twice the MIC regrowth tended to occur at 24 h although this varied from strain to strain. The interaction with other antibiotics was determined by the chequerboard technique. Usually an additive or synergistic effect was observed when meropenem or imipenem was used in combination with an aminoglycoside against Gram-negative species, while in a few cases antagonism occurred in combination with beta-lactams. Against Staph, aureus, MRSA and Staph, epidermidis synergism was usually obtained with combinations with teicoplanin or vancomycin and either synergism or addition with combinations with rifampicin, co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Studies on the biological activity of slime isolated from staphylococci].
AB  - The biological characteristic and activity of slime isolated from Staphylococcus  aureus No. 71 and Staphylococcus epidermidis No. 2 was studied. The slime isolated from both strains had high contents of protein, RNA (orcinol reaction-positive substances) and sugar. The slime showed low toxic effect when it was injected intravenously and intraperitoneally into mice. It, however, exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against mouse neutrophils in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. The enhancement of virulence of Escherichia coli by slime isolated from staphylococci was due to neutrophil-impairing effect. It is suggested that the slime isolated from S. aureus and S. epidermidis may act as an virulence factor.
TI  - The role of quinolones in staphylococcal infection.
AB  - Quinolones are highly active against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, especially enterobacteriaceae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations against, e.g. Escherichia coli are between 0.008-0.03 mg/l for ciprofloxacin, 0.06-0.25 mg/l for norfloxacin, 0.031-1.0 mg/l for ofloxacin, and 0.063-2.0 mg/l for pefloxacin. Against Staphylococcus aureus, higher concentrations are required in vitro: 0.12-0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, 0.25-4 mg/l for norfloxacin, and 0.06-0.5 mg/l for pefloxacin. These compounds have been shown to be active at similar concentrations also against Staphylococcus epidermidis and both oxacillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Clinical experience (in the order of number of patients treated) has been gathered most extensively with ciprofloxacin, followed by pefloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics and inorganic ions in virulent bacterial strains from a hospital.
AB  - Virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for their resistance to antibiotics and inorganic ions, the correlation with their clinical use and the usefulness as an epidemioliogical tool. Multiresistance was common, the antibiotypes were similar to those previously reported, but characteristic resistotypes endemic of our county were found. A correlation between resistance and metal ion consumption was not detected. Staphylococci strains were susceptible to vancomycin, cephalothin and mercury chloride; S. epidermidis showed higher rates of resistance to antibiotics and lower to cadmium chloride and potassium iodine than S. aureus. E. coli strains were susceptible to new beta-lactamans; resistance to cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin was less than 10%. P, aeruginosa was the species with the most multiresistance and antibiotype diversity, only ceftazidime, amikacin and imipenem had a resistance rate less than 11%. In both E. coli and P. aeruginosa resistance to all tested metals (except silver nitrate) was found although with different percentages.
TI  - Mobility of gentamicin resistance genes from staphylococci isolated in the United States: identification of Tn4031, a gentamicin resistance transposon from Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Homologous genes encoding resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin through the bifunctional acetylating [AAC(6')] and phosphorylating [APH(2")] aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme were identified in staphylococci isolated from patients in the United States. The mobility of gentamicin resistance (Gmr) genes found on a prototype conjugative plasmid (pGO1) was compared with that of genes cloned from chromosomal sites. Plasmid-encoded Gmr genes and flanking sequences were introduced onto a temperature-sensitive plasmid (pRN3208) from pGO1 by homologous recombination between insertion sequence-like elements present on both replicons. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus strains containing the temperature-sensitive recombinant (pGO161) at the nonpermissive temperature for plasmid replication (42 degrees C) revealed no translocation of Gmr from its plasmid location. A transposon (Tn551) resident on the same replicon did translocate. Chromosomal Gmr determinants were cloned, together with the gene for trimethoprim resistance (dfrA), from three geographically distinct S. epidermidis isolates; two were subcloned onto temperature-sensitive Escherichia coli-S. aureus shuttle plasmids as 7.2-kilobase BglII fragments. Growth of both recombination-deficient and-proficient S. aureus strains containing the cloned genes at 42 degrees C allowed detection of transposition of Gmr sequences and identification of insertion into random chromosomal sites. We have designated this 5-kilobase transposon from S. epidermidis as Tn4031.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheter materials in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Four different intravenous catheter materials, brands Teflon, Silastic, Vialon, and Tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The organisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 X 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. There was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. Results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. These characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. It is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.
TI  - Monoadduct forming photochemical reagents for labeling nucleic acids for hybridization.
AB  - We describe the synthesis of three angelicin derivatives which can be used for labeling nucleic acids with biotin. These compounds were used to label nucleic acids in the presence of lysed cell constituents. The resulting labelled nucleic acids show hybridization to a genus specific probe for E. coli. The relative comparison of sensitivity indicates that a polyamine linker is better than a polyethylene oxide linker between the biotin and angelicin moieties.
TI  - A study of microbial flora of conjunctival sac in newborns.
AB  - During the period from July to August 1987, the microbial flora in conjunctival sac of 93 newborns (186 eyes: normal vaginal delivery) and 19 newborns (38 eyes: cesarean section delivery) in nursery of Ewha Womans University Hospital were investigated for isolation and identification of bacteria on delivery day and on two days after birth. The results of the investigation are as follows: 1. Of 186 eyes (normal vaginal delivery), bacterial growth of one species was shown in 40 eyes (21.5%) on delivery day and in 64 eyes (34.4%) on two days after birth. Bacterial growth of two species shown in 10 eyes (5.4%) on delivery day and in 10 eyes (5.4%) on two days after birth. 2. Of 38 eyes (cesarean section delivery), bacterial growth of one species was shown in 2 eyes (5.3%) on delivery day and in 20 eyes (52.6%) on two days after birth. Bacterial growth of two species was shown 2 eyes (5.3%) on two days after birth. 3. Several kinds of bacterial species were isolated in normal vaginal delivery and cesarean section delivery. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus were isolated.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - IL-1 induction-capacity of defined lipopolysaccharide partial structures.
AB  - Natural and synthetic lipid A as well as natural and synthetic oligosaccharide partial structures of LPS were examined in dose-response experiments to define the minimal structure necessary for IL-1 induction and release in cultures of human mononuclear cells. Wild type LPS (S. abortus equi) and rough mutant LPS was active in minimal-doses of 1 to 100 pg/ml, whereas synthetic heptaacyl and hexaacyl lipid A (Salmonella minnesota and Escherichia coli lipid A, respectively) induced IL-1 in minimal-doses of 100 to 1,000 pg/ml and 10 to 1,000 pg/ml, respectively. Nanogram amounts (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) of synthetic monodephospho partial structures of E. coli lipid A were necessary for IL-1 induction. Synthetic pentaacyl partial structures induced IL-1 very weakly. Synthetic tetraacyl and bisacyl partial structures lacking non-hydroxylated fatty acids were not active. Compared to LPS million-fold higher doses of natural and synthetic 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid containing core oligosaccharides were necessary for IL-1 induction. Dose-response investigations with LPS and natural or synthetic partial structures established the following hierarchy in IL-1 induction-capacity: LPS greater than lipid A much greater than lipid A partial structures greater than core oligosaccharides greater than oligoacyl lipid A. Lipid A was shown here to be the portion of LPS mainly responsible for induction of IL-1 activity. The high potency of lipid A in inducing IL-1 release and the failure of the precursor Ia of lipid A to induce IL-1 production and release was also observed measuring intracellular IL-1 activity after freeze-thawing the cells. Levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in extracts of mononuclear cells correlated with biologic activity. In co-incubation experiments, precursor Ia of lipid A produced dose-dependent inhibition of production and release of IL-1 activity induced by lipid A or LPS, but not by Staphylococcus epidermidis or PHA. Incubation of cells with precursor Ia for 1h, followed by a medium change and further incubation of stimulus without precursor Ia of lipid A also resulted in inhibition. We conclude that lipid A is the main portion of LPS responsible for induction of IL-1, and that specific activation- and/or binding-mechanisms are involved in stimulation of cells with LPS and/or lipid A.
TI  - Adherence of microorganisms to breast prostheses: an in vitro study.
AB  - The quantitative and morphological characteristics of microbial adherence of four organisms--Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans--to the surfaces of different breast prostheses were observed. Semiquantitative adherence studies based on a modification of Maki's roll culture technique even after short contact times showed (1) increased microbial adherence at higher concentrations of the organisms and (2) differences in adherence properties between gram-positive bacteria and other organisms tested, noted also at lower organism concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify microorganisms on foam-covered prostheses, however, revealed organisms in the interstitial spaces that were not recovered by the plating technique. Other features on SEM were extracellular "slime" produced by S. epidermidis, which appears to act as a cement by which bacteria are held against prosthetic surfaces. These in-vitro findings suggest that brief exposure of the prostheses to a few organisms, particularly gram-positive bacteria, at the time of implantation would be sufficient inoculum for bacterial adherence to prosthetic surfaces.
TI  - Cell surface charge characteristics and their relationship to bacterial attachment to meat surfaces.
AB  - Cell surface charge and hydrophobicity of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined by hydrocarbon adherence, hydrophobic interaction, and electrostatic interaction chromatography. Surface charge and hydrophobicity were compared with the initial attachment values and rates of attachment of the bacteria to meat surfaces. There was a linear correlation between the relative negative charge on the bacterial cell surface and initial attachment to lean beef muscle (r2 = 0.885) and fat tissue (r2 = 0.777). Hydrophobicity correlated well with attachment to fat tissue only. The relative hydrophobicity of each bacterium was dependent on the specific method of determination, with wide variations noted between methods.
TI  - Bacterial infection: the main cause of acute cholestasis in newborn infants receiving short-term parenteral nutrition.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that bacterial infections are the main cause of acute cholestasis in short-term intravenously fed newborns, two groups were studied. Group I consisted of 152 newborn infants who were fed intravenously for at least 7 days and in whom severe bacterial infections developed. Group II was formed of 92 newborn infants who were matched to the group I cases with respect to the year of birth, birth weight and gestational age, Apgar scores, and duration of parenteral nutrition but who did not have infections. Bacterial infections were diagnosed on the basis of impaired microcirculation with prolonged capillary filling time, a shift to the left in the white cell differential, and a positive blood culture. Cholestasis was diagnosed when the total serum bilirubin level was greater than 4 mg/dl and the conjugated fraction made up more than 40% of the total. The results were that all 40 cases of cholestasis were found in the first group of infected infants. All of the other factors were distributed equally between both groups and could not be attributed as a major factor in the etiology of idiopathic neonatal cholestasis. The conclusion was that bacterial infections are the main cause of acute cholestasis in intravenously fed newborn infants.
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combinations of FCE 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. The combination of FCE 22101 and gentamicin against Streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. Against Enterobacter cloacae FCE 22101 had MICs of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the MICs were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin and FCE 22101 showed only addition against Enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of FCE 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against Citrobacter freundii. With Serratia spp. FCE 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but FCE 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. Similar results were obtained with strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providencia spp. FCE 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against Ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. In general the combination of FCE 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [The etiology of suppurative-inflammatory diseases caused by opportunistic microorganisms at the noninfectious disease clinic].
AB  - 5,853 strains of opportunistic microorganisms have been isolated from hospitalized patients at a polyclinic. The following microorganisms have been found to cause purulent inflammatory diseases most frequently: Escherichia coli (21.6%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (15.93%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.54%), microorganisms of the genus Klebsiella (11.86%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.91%) and microorganisms of the genus Proteus (7.5%). In cases of mixed infections Gram-negative bacteria prevail. The analysis of microbial species contained in the pathological excreta of patients in different departments has shown the prevalence of staphylococci in general surgery patients, E. coli in peritonitis and gynecological diseases, P. aeruginosa in patients with burns, Klebsiella, Proteus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa in patients with multiple traumatic lesions.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  - One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Prospective study of 75 episodes of sepsis in hemodialysed patients].
AB  - During a 38-month period the bacteremias developing in patients on hemodialysis from three centers of the Barcelona area were evaluated to assess their incidence, characteristics, and response to therapy. In the overall 13376 months of hemodialysis of the study, 75 episodes of bacteremia were detected in 64 patients; this amounts to an incidence of 5.6 episodes per 1000 hemodialysis months. The most common sources of becteremia were intravenous catheters (44%), which were mainly used as temporary vascular access, followed by the definitive vascular access (26%), the genitourinary system (10%), and the lung (6%). Twenty-seven episodes of bacteremia developed in 24 patients in whom dialysis had been started in the two previous months (11% of the overall number of new patients), and, in them, 77% originated in an intravenous catheter, while this was the origin of bacteremia in only 23% of the remaining patients. 72% of bacteremias were caused by gram positive organisms, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (60%), followed, in frequency order, by aerobic gram negative bacilli (25%), particularly Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas. Stpahylococci were significantly associated with the vascular access, either if this was a catheter or not (81% of instances), while gram negative bacilli were associated with sources different from the vascular access (48% of instances). Severe complications included 2 cases of aortic valve endocarditis, one hemorrhagic shock caused by rupture of an infected vascular access, and one suppurative phlebitis associated with a hemodialysis catheter. Staphylococcal sepsis was randomly treated with vancomycin or vancomycin plus gentamicin, without differences in the results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution and expression of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene among Staphylococcus aureus isolates of toxic shock syndrome and non-toxic shock syndrome origin.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of TSS. TSST-1 production is subject to physiologic and environmental constraints. Thus, DNA probes that detect the chromosomal gene encoding the toxin are of value diagnostically, epidemiologically, and for studies of gene expression. Several synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to two regions of the TSST-1 gene were used to ascertain the presence of this gene in the chromosomal DNA of 261 strains of S. aureus from various TSS-related and non-TSS-related sources. Isolates were from clinically confirmed menstrual and nonmenstrual cases of TSS and from healthy vaginal carriers of S. aureus. Other strains tested included clinical non-TSS isolates and food poisoning-associated staphylococcal isolates. Detection of the TSST-1 gene by the labeled gene probes correlated in all but two cases with production of TSST-1. Ten Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strains that were isolated from TSS patients and did not produce TSST-1 were also examined, as were several strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with suspected TSS. Neither group of strains possessed the TSST-1 gene. Finally, a 7-kilobase DNA restriction fragment of S. aureus containing the entire TSST-1 gene was transformed into Escherichia coli strains HB101 and DH5 alpha via a plasmid vector.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia in Finland 1981-85. Predominance of group B streptococcal infections with very early onset.
AB  - A survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. The total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Escherichia coli (14%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. Septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. GBS was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. The overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. Despite the modest progress, GBS septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are needed.
TI  - Characterization of a wide host range plasmid pANV-6 from Citrobacter diversus.
AB  - pANV-6 is a 5.85 kb, streptomycin resistant, high copy number plasmid isolated from a multi drug resistant clinical isolate of C. diversus by transformation in Escherichia coli C-600. The plasmid was very stable, noncurable and could not be amplified with chloramphenicol. It was non-conjugative among Enterobacteriaceae hosts. Plasmid was transferred by transformation to several Gram negative and Gram positive hosts. These included Esch. coli, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium glutamicum. From Staph. aureus it was transferred by conjugation to other Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Plasmid was incompatible with standard plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups H1, H2 = S,J,P and T of coliform bacteria. Plasmid has one site for restriction enzyme EcoRI and Pst I, three for Bgl 1 and non for Bgl 1, Bam HI, Hind III and X ba I.
TI  - The deconjugation ability of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the blind loop syndrome with high 14CO2 excretion--using the breath analysis technique and thin-layer chromatography.
AB  - Five patients with blind loop syndrome (Billroth II) were examined by measuring 14CO2 specific activity of expired breath samples taken at intervals after a meal containing glycine-1-14C cholate. The 5 patients tested showed a marked increase of 14CO2 specific activity. Furthermore, the ability of deconjugation of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of these patients was tested by thin layer chromatography. The bacterial species identified from the samples were as follows: enterococcus, Lactobacillus (L) buchneri, L. bifidus, L. brevis, Eubacterium (E) lentum, Bacteroides (B) vulgaricus, B. filamentosum, Corynebacterium (C) granulosum, Escherichia (E) coli, Staphylococcus (S) epidermidis, and Aerobacter (A) aerogenes. These species of bacteria, except E. coli and A. aerogenes, showed the deconjugation ability by which conjugated bile acids in ox gall was hydrolyzed. Administration of chloramphenicol (1g per day for 14 days orally divided doses) to the 5 patients reduced 14CO2 specific activity significantly. On the other hand, 9 healthy men (control subjects) who were tested showed a flat curve, and 8 of the 9 had no growth of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids. The remaining healthy man showed an overgrowth of E. coli and Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa, but the species did not have the ability of deconjugation. Thus, we concluded that the patients with blind loop syndrome(Billroth II) had the bacterial overgrowth in the efferent loop that contained species with deconjugation ability, and, as a result the bacterial overgrowth contributed to causing abnormalities (increased deconjugation) in the metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. When the concentration of conjugated bile acids in the small intestine was reduced to levels below the critical micellar concentration by several factors, fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea were induced (1,-4). Furthermore, H. Fromm and A. F. Hofmann presented in vivo that the patients with blind loop syndrome had fat malabsorption and the patients who had a high 14CO2 output after oral administration of glycine-1-14C cholate showed a low 14CO2 output after oral administration of antibiotic drug (5,6). However, there has been no report on the deconjugation ability of bile acids of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of patients with Billroth II who had positive breath tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Contamination of enteral nutrition systems during prolonged intermittent use.
AB  - Two related studies were done to determine the incidence of bacterial contamination in enteral delivery systems that were used for 15 and 7.5 hr, rinsed after each use, and reused daily in vitro for 7 and 5 days, respectively. In the first study, systems infusing either a premixed formula (Ensure) or a hand-mixed formula (Vivonex) did not show bacterial growth until the 4th day, 1.0-2.0 X 10 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Thereafter there was sporadic growth of different organisms but never increasing growth during the 7 days of infusion. In the second study, systems with Ensure were initially contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and reused for 5 days. S. aureus was eliminated by rinsing, but E. coli persisted in the delivery system at concentrations of 10(3)-10(6) CFU/ml. We conclude that clean enteral nutrition systems can be rinsed after short-infusion periods and reused up to 7 days in vitro without significant contamination; however, once a bag has become heavily contaminated some bacteria cannot be eradicated from the system by rinsing.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effect of an interferon preparation on increasing bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics].
AB  - Under the effect of human leukocytic alpha-interferon-II for injections there was observed an increase in sensitivity of bacteria to benzylpenicillin, ristomycin, novobiocin, streptomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and erythromycin. A higher antibacterial effect of the penicillin and erythromycin was recorded only with respect to initially resistant strains of staphylococci. For the antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococci the MICs of the penicillin and erythromycin decreased on the average 17.8 and 208 times (p less than 0.001) respectively. The interferon had no effect on sensitivity of bacteria to chloramphenicol.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - [The frequency of isolating urinary infection germs at a community practice and their sensitivity to various antibiotics].
AB  - Nine hundred and thirty one urine's specimens of patients affected by urinary infection have been studied by pathology practising in different towns in France. The most frequently germs retrieved are: Escherichia coli 76%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, Klebsiella 5%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 2%. Were studied Gram negative rods sensibility to ampicillin (A), cephalosporin 1st generation (C), nalidixic acid (Nal), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf); Gram positive cocci resistance to oxacillin (Oxa), erythromycin (E), pristinamycin (P), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf). For E. coli: the resistance was 24% A, 2% C1, 0.1% G, 4% Nal, 0.1% Norf. For Klebsiella: the resistance was respectively 96% A, 12% C1, 10% Nal, 18% G., 4% Norf. For P. mirabilis: 11% A, 3% C1, 0% Nal, 9% G, 0% Norf. E. coli strains cephalo R; Gram negative rods Genta R or quinolone R; staphylocoque oxa R or pristina R have been checked by HIA Begin microbiology laboratory. Discrepancies in results have been analysed. This study enabled the participants to improve their bacteriological technic, antibiogramm's reading, results' interpretation.
TI  - Effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  - Fibronectin (Fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)  with certain bacteria. Fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, of PMNLs to Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .05) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .01) but had no effect on type III, group B streptococci (GBS) or Escherichia coli. When GBS or E. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, Fn significantly enhanced the CL response of PMNLs (P less than .05). The intracellular metabolic inhibitor NaN3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited Fn-enhanced CL; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by Fn is an intracellular event. We used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of Fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by PMNLs. Fn alone promoted uptake and killing of S. aureus (P less than .01) and S. epidermidis (P less than .05) by PMNLs but did not enhance monolayer phagocytosis of GBS or E. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (P less than .01).
TI  - Bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  - Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ME1206) is a new oral cephalosporin. ME1206 is (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)- acetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-cephem-4-carboxy lic acid. The susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to ME1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. ME1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ME1206 was more active than cefaclor, T-2525, and cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of ME1206 was comparable with that of T-2525, but ME1206 was less active than cefixime. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ME1206 had high activity (MIC, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). ME1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Escherichia coli W3630 (Rms213). The 50% effective doses of ME1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of T-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of T-2588 against Staphylococcus aureus Smith.
TI  - Surgical service nosocomial infections at a Veterans Administration medical center.
AB  - Nosocomial surgical infections at a Veterans Administration medical center were monitored from February 1986 to June 1987 (17 months). Three hundred twenty-four patients had 508 nosocomial infections, including 66 patients in whom cultures were not performed. The remaining 258 patients had 584 microorganisms, including gram-negative bacilli (56.8 percent), gram-positive cocci (33.6 percent), and yeasts (8.4 percent). The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, group D enterococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were similar for nosocomial and all hospital isolates combined 84.5 percent of the time; all hospital isolates combined were more resistant in 5.5 percent and nosocomial isolates in 10.0 percent. The infection rate for surgical wounds was only 2.5 percent. When all nosocomial infection sites were compared, however, the rate for lower respiratory tract and some other infections appeared high and disproportionate. The significance of this finding is questionable because of a lack of comparable published reports from other Veterans Administration medical centers. The importance of patient population at risk of obtaining some nosocomial infections (especially lower respiratory) may be greater in adult men than in other patient populations.
TI  - In vitro quantitative model of catheter infection during simulated parenteral nutrition.
AB  - We developed a quantitative in vitro model of catheter infection. Colonization was initiated by inoculating the catheter lumen with a small number of bacteria (approximately 5 x 10(3) viable organisms). Then the inoculated catheters were used for simulated total parenteral nutrition therapy consisting of infusions for 9 h a day, and bacteria were counted in the effluent fluid against time, enabling us to monitor catheter colonization quantitatively. Bacterial colonization of prosthetic devices is a progressive process, as evidenced by the slow day-to-day increase of bacterial release seen here. On the other hand, bacterial strains of various representative species exhibited significant differences in their ability to infect catheters. These results suggest that the in vitro model presented here is a reliable tool for monitoring the degree of catheter colonization under standardized conditions and could be used for further studying the main factors of catheter-related sepsis or the treatment of this information.
TI  - Small, antibacterial and large, inactive peptides of neutrophil granules share immunoreactivity to a monoclonal antibody.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a bactericidal protein fraction that was purified from an extract of bovine neutrophil granules and that was previously shown (A. Savoini, R. Marzari, L. Dolzani, D. Serrano, G. Graziosi, R. Gennaro, and D. Romeo, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 26:405-407, 1984) to inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis. One of these antibodies, BP97, was covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10 and was used for immunoaffinity chromatography of granule extracts. Elution of the bound proteins, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, generated several peptides whose molecular weights fell in the range of 1,600 to 64,000 and which reacted to BP97 but not to other mouse monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The reaction to BP97 appeared to be specific, inasmuch as a full panel of cationic oligo- or polypeptides was not recognized by this monoclonal antibody. Among the purified granule polypeptides, the more cationic ones (with molecular weights of 4,300 to 8,000) inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli at a MIC of 12 to 50 micrograms/ml. In addition, a 1,600-molecular-weight, highly cationic peptide also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at MICs of 3 to 8 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole compared  with that of other chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - For many years now, the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (active ingredients of Bactrim) has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter. In this comparative study, the antibacterial activity of the combination against 2,229 gram-negative and 1,338 gram-positive strains encountered in domiciliary practice was tested and compared with that of other commonly used antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in microtitre plates using serial dilutions. With regard to the gram-negative strains, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, with an MIC90 of less than 2 mg/l for most isolates, was the most active substance apart from norfloxacin. The combination also had a powerful inhibitory effect on gram-positive strains, the MIC90 being between 2 and 4 mg/l for all strains except Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [The microbial factor in the chemiluminescence of the peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with suppurative surgical infection].
AB  - The luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of 30 healthy adults and 39 patients with the local and generalized forms of purulent infection was studied. Nonstimulated chemiluminescence and the index of chemiluminescence stimulation in the presence of opsonized Staphylococcus aureus added in vitro were determined. The former characteristic was found to be directly and the latter one, inversely related to the concentration of S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, but not E. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Citrobacter, in the primary focus. At the microbial concentration exceeding 10(4) cells/g of tissue, the former characteristic was essentially higher than the level of chemiluminescence in healthy persons. With the improvement of the general state of the patients and in the absence of microorganisms in the wound as the result of complex treatment this characteristic decreased to values comparable with the reaction of neutrophils in healthy persons.
TI  - Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - A gene bank from a clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile expressing high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was constructed by cloning Sau3A-cleaved clostridial DNA fragments into the plasmid vector pUC13. Among 1,020 clones tested, 11 were resistant to chloramphenicol; 1 of these, with an insert size of 1.9 kilobases (pPPM9), was studied further. The clone pPPM9 was mapped using a variety of restriction enzymes, and a 0.27-kilobase EcoRV-TaqI restriction fragment was shown to be within the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) gene by using transposon (Tn1000) mutagenesis. The 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as DNA probes in hybridization studies. Southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal DNA from Cmr strains of C. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. Hybridization of the gene probes against Cmr strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella edwardsii, Escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - Comparison of translocation rates of various indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph node.
AB  - Bacterial translocation is defined as the passage of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through the lamina propria to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and other organs. We compared the relative abilities of various aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria to translocate from the GI tract to the MLN in gnotobiotic mice colonized with single strains of bacteria. Indigenous gram-negative enteric bacilli translocated in large numbers to the MLN, whereas gram-positive bacteria translocated at intermediate levels and obligately anaerobic bacteria at only very low levels. Our results suggest that enteric bacilli such as Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Enterobacter are associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia in debilitated patients, because these bacteria translocate more efficiently from the GI tract than do other bacteria, especially obligate anaerobes.
TI  - [Single day treatment in acute cystitis].
AB  - The effect of a single day treatment with 600 mg norfloxacin 600 mg ofloxacin or  1,920 mg trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol was determined on 114 patients with acute cystitis. The overall clinical efficacy was excellent in 101 patients (89%), moderate in 9 patients (8%) and poor in 4 patients (3%). Recurrence was observed in 8 cases (8%) within 6 weeks after the treatment. The effectiveness rate and the recurrence rate were inferior in those caused by S. epidermidis compared with those caused by E. coli.
TI  - Efficacy of various methods of sterilization of acupuncture needles.
AB  - The iatrogenic transmission of hepatitis B virus by inadequately sterilized acupuncture needles recently has been reported. Because some licensed chiropractors use acupuncture as a therapeutic modality, we have evaluated sterilization methods for these needles, which would be adaptable for use in a chiropractic office. Dry heat, boiling water, pressurized steam, sodium hypochlorite, and 70% alcohol were compared with a glass bead dry heat sterilizer originally developed for dental instruments. Presterilized acupuncture needles were contaminated with Bacillus stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis and sterilized for intervals ranging from 5 sec to 30 min. The needles were then cultured to determine the efficacy of the sterilization regimen. Seventy percent alcohol was ineffective as a sterilization method. In terms of both time and convenience, the glass bead apparatus was the most efficient of the remaining methods tested. B. stearothermophilus-contaminated acupuncture needles were sterilized within 10 sec of exposure to preheated glass beads. Less than 10 sec exposure killed E. coli and S. epidermidis. A significant advantage of the glass bead sterilizer over the other methods was the absence of physical damage to the needles.
TI  - Late infections of total joint prostheses. A review and recommendations for prevention.
AB  - The incidence of late infection of total joint prostheses is 0.6%. Because this incidence has increased from 0.08% in 1978, the authors reviewed their experience and the literature in search of pathogenetic and preventative measures. The most common pathogen responsible for late prosthetic joint infections was staphylococcus (54%; both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), even when infection was of dental origin. The three most common origins of infection were skin and soft tissue (46%), dental (15%), and urinary (13%). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen when the source was the urinary tract. Mortality and cost calculations indicate that chemoprophylaxis is justified for dental procedures and probably also for other surgical procedures in organs containing microflora. Prophylaxis must include antistaphylococcal drugs. The first generation cephalosporin antibiotics are recommended.
TI  - Effect of ofloxacin on oral and gastrointestinal microflora in patients undergoing gastric surgery.
AB  - The effect of ofloxacin on the microflora in saliva, gastric juice, and feces was evaluated in 24 patients undergoing gastric surgery. A single peroral dose of 400 mg ofloxacin was given to each patient 2-4 h before surgery. The concentrations of ofloxacin in serum, saliva, gastric juice, and gastric mucosa tissue were assayed. Only Branhamella cocci were affected in the saliva. In the gastric juice, both the aerobic and anaerobic flora were suppressed on the day of surgery, but increased in number afterwards. There was a significant correlation between gastric pH and the number of microorganisms isolated in the gastric juice on day 0. In faeces, the aerobic and part of the anaerobic flora were suppressed by the administration of ofloxacin. Ofloxacin was well tolerated by the patients. Four of 24 patients developed postoperative complications. Microorganisms isolated from wound sepsis and intraabdominal sepsis (three patients) were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci group A, Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli. All related infections occurred in patients with very low ofloxacin serum concentrations, probably due to impaired absorption. Oral antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom impaired gastric emptying can be expected.
TI  - [Shunt meningitis: a recognizable clinical picture?].
AB  
TI  - The microbiology of multiple organ failure. The proximal gastrointestinal tract as an occult reservoir of pathogens.
AB  - The microbiology of infection acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU) was studied prospectively in 205 consecutive patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit. A multiple organ failure (MOF) score was calculated for each admission. Susceptibility to ICU-acquired infection increased with increasing MOF scores. While Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci were the most common isolates from infections present at the time of ICU admission, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida, and Pseudomonas dominated infections occurring in patients with high MOF scores. Mortality correlated highly with infection due to S epidermidis or Candida and only poorly with infection due to Pseudomonas or E coli; significant foci of invasive infection were frequently absent at autopsy. Quantitative cultures of proximal gastrointestinal fluid in 16 of these patients showed Candida, S epidermidis, and Pseudomonas to be the most common isolates, and all but one patient colonized with these organisms had invasive infection with the same organism. The proximal gastrointestinal tract appears to be an important occult reservoir of the predominant pathogens in MOF.
TI  - Nalidixic acid plus sodium citrate twice daily in the treatment of acute urinary  tract infection. Swedish Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - Negram-Citrat (0.66 g nalidixic acid plus 4 g sodium citrate, NAC) twice daily for five days was evaluated in 257 women with symptoms of acute lower urinary tract infection and nalidixic acid sensitive bacteriuria. At two days post-treatment 85% of the patients were abacteriuric while nalidixic acid resistant Escherichia coli bacteriuria was present in five %. Side effects of NAC were usually mild and transient and resulted in interruption of medication in three % of the patients and visual disturbances were volunteered by 1.6%. At follow-up one month after treatment bacteriuria had recurred in 18% of the patients immediately cured, thus resulting in an overall success rate of 70%. Of the 35 recurring strains three (1 E. coli, 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis) were nalidixic acid resistant.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to intravenous cannulae: influence of implantation in the rabbit and of enzyme treatments.
AB  - Comparison was made of the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six types of intravascular cannula material. Adhesion to materials removed from rabbit tissues did not differ significantly between types of material or between bacterial species. In contrast, major differences were found when unimplanted materials were examined; the overall rank order of adhesiveness of bacteria to unimplanted materials (S. epidermidis greater than P. aeruginosa greater than S. aureus much greater than K. aerogenes greater than E. coli) was highly significant (F = 13.0, P less than 0.0005), and although no single material was consistently least attractive to all micro-organisms, FEP-Teflon and PTFE-Teflon showed significantly lower overall affinity for bacteria than other materials (P less than 0.001); all species showed a significant preference for a silicone polymer (P less than 0.0005). The nature of the bacterial surface structures responsible for adhesion were investigated by the actions of pronase and mixed glycosidase, which produced significant respective decreases and increases in adhesion of staphylococci to unimplanted materials; their effects on the Gram-negative bacilli were less consistent.
TI  - A survey of aerobic bacteria and fungi in the feces of healthy psittacine birds.
AB  - Fecal samples from 61 clinically healthy psittacine birds of a wide variety of species were cultured for bacteria and fungi. The most common bacterial isolates were gram-positive bacilli, which were recovered from 60 of the 61 birds. These organisms included Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, and Streptomyces. Gram-positive cocci, cultured from the feces of 21 of the birds, included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., and Micrococcus spp. Only 6 of the 61 psittaciformes yielded gram-negative bacteria, with Escherichia coli being the most frequent isolate. Gram-negative bacilli were recovered from 4 of the 31 privately owned birds and 2 of the 30 petshop birds sampled. In addition to the bacteria, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Aspergillus sp. were isolated from 13 fecal cultures. Candida albicans was isolated exclusively from 5 petshop birds. The number of birds yielding Corynebacterium and gram-negative bacteria increased with age, whereas the number of birds yielding lactobacilli and yeasts decreased with age. The organisms isolated and their significance as potential pathogens in psittacine birds are discussed.
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia in a large Spanish teaching hospital: analysis of factors influencing prognosis.
AB  - Five hundred forty-three episodes of nosocomial bacteremia were prospectively followed in a large Spanish university hospital. The commonest isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida species. The most frequent sources of infection were intravenous lines, urinary tract, and lower respiratory tract. Overall mortality was 18%. A step-forward logistic regression analysis defined eight variables independently influencing the outcome: shock, underlying rapidly fatal disease, high-risk source of bacteremia (intraabdominal, lower respiratory tract, or not identified), age more than 70 years, hospitalization in intensive care or medical units, inappropriate antibiotic treatment, infection due to a high-risk microorganism (P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, or Candida), and development of septic metastasis. The identification of those factors independently influencing the outcome and their possible modification may represent a further step in the control of nosocomial bacteremia by improving its prognosis.
TI  - Characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis mutants sensitive to ultraviolet radiation.
AB  - Five UV-sensitive mutants obtained by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) treatment of the Staphylococcus epidermidis W5 strain were characterized phenotypically by assaying their UV- and MNNG-sensitivities, lysogenic inducibility, host-cell reactivation and Weigle reactivation capacities. The results were compared with those of well-characterized Escherichia coli strains, permitting the identification of: 2 mutants that behave as Uvr- Umu-; 1 mutant that appears analogous to Uvr-; 1 mutant that resembles LexA- and 1 mutant that exhibits a RecA- phenotype. The study of these mutants can contribute to the understanding of the repair mechanisms in S. epidermidis.
TI  - Is pelvic inflammatory disease an indication for treatment with ciprofloxacin?
AB  - This pilot study was carried out on 23 gynaecological patients suffering from salpingitis, salpingitis and pelviperitonitis, Douglas' abscess, and vaginal stump abscess. 21 courses were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The diagnoses had been established mainly by pelviscopy and by clinical gynaecological examinations. The dosage was 2 X 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for 7.6 (5-11) days. Cervical smears collected before therapy revealed the most common pathogens to be Escherichia coli and staphylococci, followed by Proteus mirabilis and streptococci. Clinically ciprofloxacin produced a complete cure in 16 patients (76%), and a clear improvement in four patients (19%). One patient left hospital before completing the therapy. Laboratory tests did not reveal any pathological findings, and ophthalmological examinations (fundoscopy, visus, colour perception) on 16 patients, before and after treatment, likewise did not show any changes. In one patient, therapy had to be discontinued after three days because of pruritic exanthema and vertigo. A second patient complained of strong pain behind the eyes and headache. In both patients these symptoms disappeared completely on discontinuation of treatment. The study showed clinical efficacy of orally administered ciprofloxacin in pelvic inflammatory disease.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum.
AB  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators of the 1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyrid-4-one class (the L1 series) and 1-hydroxypyrid-2-one (L4) on bacterial growth in human serum was compared with those of the plant iron chelators mimosine and maltol and of the microbial siderophore desferrioxamine. None of the synthetic chelators enhanced growth of 3 Gram-negative organisms (Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); in some cases they were even inhibitory. L4 strongly stimulated growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but the L1 series had only a marginal effect. Maltol was mildly inhibitory to all 4 bacterial species, while mimosine enhanced the growth of S. epidermidis and Y. enterocolitica but had little effect on E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Desferrioxamine enhanced the growth of all except E. coli. These results suggest that the chelators of synthetic or plant origin may carry less risk of increasing susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients undergoing chelation therapy for iron overload than does desferrioxamine, the drug currently in clinical use.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms isolated from the urine of patients with suspected urinary tract infections].
AB  - In our study 5331 urine specimen have been examined. In 22 of the total 2 types of bacteria have been isolated and in the cultures of 1167 patients colony counts over than 100.000/ml. have been determined. These are 599 Escherichia coli, 161 Hemolytic Escherichia coli, 104 Klebsiella, 93 Proteus, 81 Pseudomonas, 65 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 44 Staphylococcus aureus, 24 Enterobacter, 18 Enterococcus. 602 of the infected patients were women and 565 were men. According to antibiogram results microorganisms were mostly resistant to Tetracycline (97.7%), subsequently to Ampicillin (87.5%) and to Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (72.8%). Ofloxacin (97.7%), Ceftriaxone (86.4%) and Cefotaxime (86.1%) were found effective on these organisms.
TI  - Antibiotic spectrum of isolated germs in the vaginal smear of Nigerian women.
AB  - The bacteriological research of 534 vaginal smears of pregnant women and patients of the gynaecological ward in Abeokuta showed in 21.6% beta-hem. Streptococcus group D, in 10.9% Staphylococcus epidermidis, in 5.3% Escherichia coli, in 3.6% Staphylococcus aureus, in 1.3% beta-hem. Streptococcus group B and in 7.8% yeasts. 48% of all smears remained sterile. The antibiotics with the least effect were Tetracyclines and Penicillines. Trimethoprim and Sulfonamid, Ticarcillin and Netilmycin were able to prevent the bacterial growth by at least 89%. Isolated germs of private patients showed higher resistance against Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol than those of non-private patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. The organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group A) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin). The 13 patients in group B received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. The mean duration of therapy in groups A and B was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. This difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. All patients from group A showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. In group B only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because CSF culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.
TI  - The in-vitro assessment of a collagen/vicryl (polyglactin) composite film together with candidate suture materials for potential use in urinary tract surgery. III. Adherence of bacteria to the material surface.
AB  - A Collagen/Vicryl (Polyglactin) composite membrane (developed for use in urinary  tract surgery) has been incubated in cultures of radioactively labelled urinary tract pathogens vis Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis for up to 1 h. For comparison, collagen film, Vicryl mesh, and a number of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures were similarly tested. Following incubation, samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions employed, only minimal adherence of the micro-organisms to the collagen coated Vicryl mesh, its two individual components, as well as Vicryl and nylon sutures was observed. Significantly greater numbers of bacteria, however, adhered to silk and Chromic Catgut. The results suggest that adherence of microorganisms to the prosthesis even in infected urine is unlikely to develop into a microcolony of bacteria. However, it should be emphasised that great care must be exercised when extrapolating from the in-vitro to the in-vivo situation.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). II. Background of patients].
AB  - We have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. As for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. By contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. There were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. Thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. In 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were Gram-positive organisms. When species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of E. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. The isolation rate of Gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. Escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. These results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. In other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - SIGNAL blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  - In the SIGNAL (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. Displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. The single-bottle SIGNAL system was compared with paired BACTEC 16B and 7D (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. The single SIGNAL bottle was a good as the combined BACTEC media for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for Candida spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. The SIGNAL system failed to detect four of five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. The SIGNAL system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.
TI  - The value of prophylactic antibiotics during the insertion of long-term indwelling silastic right atrial catheters in cancer patients.
AB  - Over a 3.5 year period from August 1982 to December 1985, 200 Hickman catheters (Evermed, Medina, WA) were inserted into patients at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days). Organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included Staphylococcus epidermidis 36, S. aureus 30, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, Escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-CDC-JK 3. Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. Prophylactic antibiotic coverage should be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.
TI  - [Studies on antibacterial activity of flomoxef and its distribution to serum and  intraperitoneal exudate in surgery].
AB  - 1. Bacteria detected in cases of acute abdominal ailments encountered in the first department of surgery at Hiroshima university and its related facilities during the recent 4 and a half years were reviewed and the antibacterial activities of flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) against these isolates were investigated. As a result, this antibiotic was found to show very high activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus spp. 2. One gram of FMOX dissolved in 100 ml of physiological saline was administered by intravenous drip infusion during operation and its concentrations in serum and intraperitoneal exudate were determined. The intraperitoneal exudate concentration exceeded the serum concentration in 2 hours after the completion of the drip infusion and, reached high enough concentration to be effective against susceptible bacteria with MICs about 12.5 micrograms/ml. The above results suggested that the new cephem antibiotic FMOX for injection should be sufficiently effective against acute peritonitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of some bacteria isolated from clinical samples to third-generation cephalosporins].
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of some Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas strains to third-generation cephalosporins in-vitro by disk diffusion technique which are in use in Turkey. These bacteria isolated from various clinical samples at the bacteriology laboratory in Ibni Sina hospital between January 1986-January 1987. The antibiotics used in this study are ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone. According to the results of this study, it can be said that cefotaxime is the most effective third-generation cephalosporin against all these bacteria by testing in-vitro.
TI  - Comparison of techniques for the selection of bacteria-free sperm preparations.
AB  - The authors compared the three most commonly used sperm preparation techniques--swim-up, fall-down, and Percoll gradient--for their ability to recover highly motile sperm and minimize bacterial contamination. Eleven human semen samples collected by masturbation were used and run in parallel with the three methods. A semiquantitative bacterial analysis was performed in all samples and results expressed in colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). The Percoll gradient technique resulted in an average sperm concentration of 5.81 +/- 4.4 X 10(6) ml, and the average bacterial concentration dropped from 8.66 +/- 12.96 X 10(3) CFU/ml in semen to 0.01 +/- 0.03 X 10(3) CFU/ml. The bacterial count was not significantly different when the raw semen was compared with the swim-up or the fall-down preparations. The authors conclude that the Percoll gradient method yields an adequate sperm concentration, with high motility and improved morphology, while eliminating bacterial contamination.
TI  - Evidence that bacteria induce translocation of protein kinase C activity in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Particulate fraction associated protein kinase activity was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was found to increase particulate fraction associated protein kinase C activity in a time and concentration dependent manner. The increase comprised both the phospholipid dependent and independent kinase activity and was augmented by addition of serum. Similar observations were done using Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiellae pneumoniae. However, Escherichia coli only increased the phospholipid independent kinase activity in the particulate fraction, which suggests the presence of protease activity.
TI  - Endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  - Germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. In 48 germ-free male, Sprague-Dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a nephrotoxin; to Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected E. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. Morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. Means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The highest counts and scores were found in rats given NDGA and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. Counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either NDGA or endotoxin. Results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of NDGA as causes of nephropathy. They indicate that endotoxin and NDGA act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free NDGA-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - The growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing glucose, amino acids, and lipid emulsion in one container and amino acid/dextrose solutions [conventional total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formulations] were studied in a controlled laboratory experiment for their ability to support the growth of microorganisms. Both TNA and conventional TPN formulations for peripheral and central venous administration with standard additives were inoculated with microorganisms to provide 10(1)-10(2) colony-forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. The admixtures were stored at room temperature and samples for quantitative microbiology were taken at time 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were able to proliferate in central TNAs, but the growth of these organisms was retarded in conventional TPN solutions. In the peripheral formulations, K. pneumoniae and E. coli proliferated in both the TNA and conventional TPN systems, whereas P. aeruginosa grew well only in the peripheral TNA. S. epidermidis was not able to grow in any admixtures tested; however, C. albicans grew well in all admixtures, but growth was slower in the conventional central TPN. In conclusion, peripheral and central TNAs supported the growth of microorganisms significantly better than conventional TPN solutions.
TI  - Non-IgE-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  - A wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca and K. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. Further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that E. coli-induced histamine release differed from IgE-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and pH profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. A lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. Escherichia coli and anti-IgE did not synergize in inducing histamine release. The production of PGD2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with E. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - [Bone infections: treatment by ofloxacin. Apropos of 10 cases].
AB  - Because of its pharmacokinetic, broad spectrum and oral administration, ofloxacin can be used in the treatment of chronic bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 10 patients with subacute or chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Patients were given orally 200 mg 12 hourly. Treatment duration went on from 2 to 6 months. In this trial, the evaluation was successful in the 10 cases with a delay of 2 to 13 months (m 8,9) after the end of the treatment. Prosthetic material has been taken off in 1 case out of 4 patients (prosthetic hip) because of persistaet free bacteria outflow. For one patient, a superinfection with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin was noticed at the second month. Bone levels (microbiological method) were between 1,3 and 9,7 mg/l and always higher to the MIC of the bacteria. Biological tolerance was satisfactory in spite of a rise of transaminase level, a transient renal disfunction whom relationship to the treatment was difficult. 3 transient photosensitivities were also noticed.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with neoplastic disease.
AB  - This study reviewed 431 episodes of septicemia occurring in 356 patients with cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center during 1982. The most frequent organisms causing 273 episodes in 239 non-neutropenic patients were Escherichia coli (20 percent), Staphylococcus aureus (13 percent), polymicrobic (12 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Klebsiella species (7 percent), Candida species (7 percent), Bacteroides species (6 percent), Enterobacter species (4 percent), and Clostridium species (4 percent). The overall mortality was 31 percent (21 percent with adequate therapy; 50 percent with inadequate therapy). The most frequent organisms causing 158 episodes in 117 neutropenic patients were polymicrobic (21 percent), E. coli (16 percent), Klebsiella species (15 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Candida species (6 percent), S. aureus (6 percent), Streptococcus faecalis (5 percent), S. epidermidis (4 percent), and Corynebacterium CDC-JK (3 percent). The overall mortality was 52 percent (36 percent with adequate therapy; 88 percent with inadequate therapy). Since a review a decade ago, the spectrum of organisms changed in that the gram-positive organisms, S. faecalis, S. epidermidis, and C. CDC-JK, emerged as important pathogens. Neutropenic patients had a high incidence (42 percent) of septicemia due to multiple organisms, occurring concurrently or sequentially. The overall mortality of these patients was exceptionally high (80 percent). In contrast, the overall mortality of neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia was comparable to that of non-neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia (37 percent versus 29 percent).
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibodies to various bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans in human and rabbit sera.
AB  - Sera from patients with verified systemic staphylococcal infection contained antibodies reactive with peptidoglycan (PG) from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. The presence of anti-PG cross-reactive antibodies was verified in patient sera by inhibition studies with the various bacterial PGs. Antibodies to nonstaphylococcal PGs were also elevated in sera from rabbits immunized with S. aureus PG. Antibodies to S. aureus PG were removed with the synthetic peptide analogs of S. aureus PG, the L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, L-Lys-D-Ala, and (Gly)5 determinants, as well as with an S. aureus PG peptide fragment containing the determinants D-Ala-D-Ala and L-Lys-D-Ala. Isolated antibodies to the PG peptides, both synthetic and native, were reactive with S. aureus and S. epidermidis PGs. The antibodies to the D-Ala-D-Ala and the L-Lys-D-Ala determinants were also reactive with S. pyogenes PG, but not with PGs from M. lysodeikticus, B. subtilis, and E. coli.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Congenital and nosocomial sepsis in infants born in a regional perinatal unit: cause, outcome, and white blood cell response.
AB  - The incidence, cause, and outcome of sepsis and the white blood cell response were studied in 6315 infants born in a regional perinatal unit. The incidence of neonatal sepsis was 6.5 per 1000 live births. Congenital sepsis (12 cases) was overwhelming, with associated maternal infection (92%), neutropenia (75%), and high rate of mortality (50%). The most common organism was Escherichia coli (58%). Gestational age and birth weight were similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. There was a strong correlation between total white blood cell count and both mature and immature neutrophil counts in survivors but this correlation decreased substantially in neonates that died. Analysis of variance indicated that the means for polymorphonuclear leukocyte and immature neutrophil counts were significantly higher in survivors. Nosocomial sepsis (38 cases) occurred in premature low birth weight infants receiving invasive, intensive care. The most common organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (76%). Total white blood cell, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, and immature neutrophil counts rose significantly in response to sepsis. None died. Prevention of congenital sepsis requires methods to detect early maternal-fetal infection. Providing granulocytes to neutropenic neonates with congenital sepsis might improve outcome.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. Human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. In contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
TI  - [Microbial etiology of the MMA syndrome (mastitis-metritis-agalactia) in swine raised commercially].
AB  - A total of 147 uterine-cervical exudates and milk samples from 165 lobes of the mammary gland of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA) were studied microbiologically. It was found that greatest was the share of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus organisms taking part in the microbial etiology of the syndrome. Second ranked Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Corynebacterium pyogenes along with some aerobic sporulating bacilli.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in the Port Harcourt metropolis of Nigeria.
AB  - The Port Harcourt metropolis of Nigeria was screened to establish the prevalence  of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) over a 3 year period. An occurrence rate of 15% was detected. The females presented a higher incidence rate (9%) than the males (6%). Previous history of urinary tract infection (UTI) was seen to be contributory to ABU; so also was sexual activity. Of the isolates obtained, Escherichia coli was found to be predominant (45%). An isolation rate of 3.7% was realised for Staphylococcus epidermidis. This emphasizes its role in UTI. The advantages of screening for ABU was examined and it is suggested that individuals should be screened for ABU at least twice a year.

TI  - Intraperitoneal immunoglobulin (IG) treatment in prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis in CAPD.
AB  - To evaluate peritoneal immunological defences and to find a possible cure for alterations in the mechanism, we studied the capacity of peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) to opsonize bacteria and the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages (PM). Subjects were 40 uremic patients followed for a mean period of 36 months and 40 normal women who underwent laparoscopy (Controls). Opsonic capacity for S.epidermidis of undiluted PDE from CAPD patients with low peritonitis occurrence (LPI) proved similar to that of 10% control serum. It was, however, noticeably inferior when patients were of high peritonitis incidence (HPI). In these cases IgG concentration in PDE was lower than in patients of LPI. A significant correlation was revealed between opsonization capacity for bacteria and IgG concentration values in PDE. We found inverse correlation between opsonic capacity of PDE and number of episodes of peritonitis. Phagocytic capacity of PM from CAPD patients was similar to that of control PM when microorganisms were preopsonized by control serum. Intraperitoneal Immunoglobulin treatment raised PDE opsonization capacity and lowered peritonitis incidence in patients of previously HPI, thus demonstrating the importance of abnormal organization in CAPD peritonitis and the possibility of preventing infections by intraperitoneal Immunoglobulin treatment. These prevention results do not occur with intravenous Immunoglobulin treatment.
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.

TI  - Septicemia in a university pediatric hospital: a five-year analysis of the bacterial and fungal isolates and outcome of the infections.
AB  - A 5-year analysis comprising all positive blood culture isolates from a 222-bed university pediatric hospital in Helsinki revealed 369 bacteremic but only 8 fungemic cases. Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, 19% of the total material each, were the most common pathogens isolated, followed by S. epidermidis (11%), Escherichia coli (8%), pneumococci (8%), and group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (6%). Remarkable differences in distribution of the pathogens were observed in different hospital units. However, 5 most common microorganisms covered 62-86% of the spectrum in each unit. Two bacteria, H. influenzae in the unit for infectious diseases and S. aureus in the hematology-oncology unit were significantly (p less than 0.001 or less than 0.01, respectively) more common than any other organism in those units. The average case fatality rate was 14% with a range from 1.5% to 40%, depending upon the causative agent isolated. Also, the mortality was much higher in neonates than in other age groups. We conclude that by monitoring the blood isolates separately in each unit one can find remarkable differences in the same hospital. On the other hand, characteristics of an individual hospital may vary significantly from those described in textbooks. These characteristics should be recognized and taken into account in the antimicrobial policy.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris against bacterial isolates from clinical specimens.
AB  - Chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris was more active compared with chlorhexidine against the following species of organisms: Acinetobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Providence species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis, when tested in isosensitest agar. The addition of 20% serum to the medium reduced its effectiveness mainly against Providence species, Proteus species, and Streptococcus faecalis. However, the potential for this solution as a bladder instillation or topical antiseptic should be considered because of its reduced side effects compared with chlorhexidine alone, and its increased general effectiveness against all isolates tested.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - The incidence and clinical significance of intravenous fat emulsion contamination during infusion.
AB  - So that the actual contamination rate of intravenous fat emulsions, as well as the type of microbial contamination, could be quantified, 103 bottles of 10% fat emulsion were collected near infusion completion from patients' bedsides. All samples were cultured and compared according to actual hanging time, in addition to the amount and type of microbial contamination. Recovered organisms included Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, and Micrococcus. Sample analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences in extrinsic microbial contamination rate or organism multiplication between samples infusing for less than or equal to 12 hr and those infusing longer. Although these products support microbial growth, the contaminants introduced into the infusate by environmental or touch contamination yielded minimal colony growth. No patient developed signs or symptoms of bacteremia during the study period. Therefore, infusion of intravenous fat emulsion products over extended periods of time in this study did not increase the risk of developing infectious complications.
TI  - The comparison of myocardial dysfunction in three forms of experimental septic shock.
AB  - A rabbit model of septic shock was used to determine if myocardial dysfunction is a common component of shock due to diverse neonatal pathogens, and prostaglandins modulate septic myocardial dysfunction. The infusion of heat-killed Escherichia coli (group I), Haemophilus influenzae (group II), or Staphylococcus epidermidis (group III) produced significant decreases in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (p less than 0.05). Each organism also produced significant changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, while pulmonary artery pressure was altered in groups I and III. Saline-infused control animals (group IV) exhibited no significant changes in any hemodynamic variable. Blood gas variables were not significantly changed in any group. These cardiovascular changes appeared dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism since indomethacin pretreatment prevented the cardiovascular changes induced by bacterial infusion. These results suggest that septic myocardial dysfunction is a common component of gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock, and that myocardial dysfunction is modulated by prostaglandin products.
TI  - Stimulation of human PMNs in vitro by a succinimide molecular complex of methylfurylbutyrolactone.
AB  - The immunopotentiating effects on human neutrophils of a new synthetic immune biological response modifer were studied. The compound is a succinimide crystalline molecular complex of methylfurylbutyrolactone (MFBL). The MFBL succinimide (MFBL-S) derivative was tested for its in vitro effects on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions. At microgram quantities, MFBL-S stimulated a twofold increase in: directed migration of PMNs; adherence to nylon; and uptake of E. coli lipopolysaccharide. The MFBL-S enhanced phagocytosis by PMNs of S. epidermidis and E. coli. Additionally, intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by MFBL-S treated PMNs was significantly increased at all doses studied, whereas killing of E. coli was only significantly different from controls at concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml.
TI  - A one-year survey of nosocomial bacteraemia at a Danish university hospital.
AB  - A 1-year prospective study of nosocomial bacteraemia was performed at Hvidovre Hospital with special reference to frequency, focus of infection and prognosis. All patients were examined clinically in order to confirm the bacteraemia. In total, 98 hospital-acquired bacteraemias were observed, giving an incidence rate of 0.28%. Bacteraemia due to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominated. The overall mortality was 38%; 65% of the patients with S. aureus bacteraemia died, 25% due to the bacteraemia. The most common types of infection were urinary tract infections and intravenous catheter infections. Fifty-five of the bacteraemias were caused by foreign bodies, mostly urinary catheters and intravenous catheters, and in 14 cases the focus was unknown. The patient population was severely ill patients. We conclude that nosocomial bacteraemia occurs specially in severely ill patients often preceded by indwelling urinary or intravenous catheters. The patients seldom die due to the bacteraemia, but they die with concomitant bacteraemia.
TI  - [Comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1984). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Groups of bacteria were isolated from patients with infections of urinary tracts, and backgrounds of these isolates and patients have been studied in terms of the sexual distribution, and distributions of sexes versus age of the patients relationships between bacterial types and sexual and age distribution of the patients from whom the isolates were obtained correlation ages of patients and types of infections, the association of certain types of bacteria with certain infections and the effect of antibacterial treatments on these types of bacteria, approximately 20% of simple infections of urinary tracts occurred in males and approximately 80% in females on average from 1981 to 1984. This ratio showed hardly any changes during this period. Likewise, male patients comprised approximately 60-70% of all the cases with complicated infections of urinary tracts regardless of indwelling or without indwelling of catheters. In terms of age, the ratio of urinary tract infections was almost universally observed, e.g., for patients in 40's: 10.0% in 1981, 11.0% in 1984, while in those in 70's: 25.5% and 21.2%, respectively. Consequently, background factors of the cases with infections of urinary tracts, such as sexes, age, or simple or complicated, remained almost stable, whereas bacteria involved showed considerable variations. In 1982 and 1983, the frequency of isolations of Enterococcus spp. was approximately 8% in both males and females. However, in 1984, the frequency of isolation of Enterococcus spp. was 22.5% in the males 17.9% in the females. The frequency of isolation of Enterococcus spp. increased in all age groups, but the frequency was not particularly high among the aged. A study on variations and isolation frequencies of bacteria before the administration of antibiotic agents revealed that isolation frequencies of Enterococcus spp. sharply increased in 1983, and this high frequency remained in 1984. The frequency of isolation of E. coli tended to decrease year after year. This finding represents that the frequency of isolations of E. coli from materials of cases with simple infections of urinary tracts has decreased, showing that pathogenic bacteria from simple infections of urinary tracts were becoming similar to that of the complicated infections of urinary tracts. These findings seem to be worth mentioning here. In cases receiving administrations of antibacterial and antibiotic agents for more than 8 days. Frequencies of isolation from cases without catheter retention and from those with catheter retention were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Comparison of cefixime and co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A double-blind general practice study.
AB  - Five hundred and twenty-eight patients with presumptive acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) were randomly assigned to receive cefixime 400 mg once daily, cefixime 200 mg twice daily or co-trimoxazole 2 tablets twice a day for 10 days; 477 completed at least 5 days of therapy. Of the patients 342 (65%) had positive baseline urine cultures, yielding 353 pathogens. A microbiological response was determined for 280 pathogens (79%), eradication being observed in over 94% of isolates; 153 pathogens (43%) were sensitive to both cefixime and co-trimoxazole and eradication was observed in over 96% of cases. Clinical response correlated well with microbiological response. The incidence of diarrhoea and stool changes was higher (P less than 0.005) in the patients who received cefixime once daily than in the other groups. There was a significantly higher incidence of stool changes with cefixime twice daily than with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05), but these did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Nausea was commoner with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05). The majority of pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and staphylococci. Approximately 24% of E. coli were resistant in vitro to co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.005). Cefixime 200 mg twice daily is an effective and safe alternative to co-trimoxazole in the management of acute uncomplicated UTI.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of monophosphoryl lipid A on host resistance to bacterial infection.
AB  - The ability of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) to enhance nonspecific host resistance to bacterial infections was studied. Mice were treated with MPLA prior to intraperitoneal challenge with Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Animals received additional MPLA for 2 days postinfection, and survival rates were determined. Ten micrograms of MPLA per mouse significantly improved the survival of animals infected with either bacterial species. Dose-response studies showed significant MPLA-induced protection at doses of 6 micrograms/kg against E. coli challenge and 60 micrograms/kg against S. epidermidis challenge.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial/fungal growth in a combined parenteral nutrition solution.
AB  - Appropriately mixed, compatible solutions of glucose, amino acids and lipid have  recently become available for clinical use. While a single hyperalimentation solution has several advantages over the conventional two-bottle technique, its effect on infusion-related septicemia is unknown. An in vitro, mock infusion system identical to that used in our new-born intensive care unit was set up to assess the relative growth rates of three microorganisms in several parenteral nutrition mixtures. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans was measured in seven different alimentation solutions, including two combined solutions. Generally, microbial growth was the same or decreased in combined solutions as compared to fat alone although considerably greater than that observed in nonlipid containing solutions. In addition, the ability of these organisms to pass in-line terminal filters of pore size 0.22 and 1.2 microns was assessed.

TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dilute povidone-iodine solutions used for ocular surface disinfection in dogs.
AB  - Bacterial cultures of specimens from healthy canine eyelids and ocular surfaces were found to demonstrate bacterial growth in 69.7% (53/76) of the eyes sampled. Organisms most commonly isolated included: Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus sp, S epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. Evaluation of dilute povidone-iodine solutions for effectiveness as ocular surface disinfectants was conducted. Bacterial growth initially detected in 32 of 46 eyes was not detected after disinfection with a 2-minute scrub and 2-minute soaking procedure, using 1:2, 1:10, or 1:50 dilutions of a povidone-iodine solution that contained 1% available iodine. The eyelid and ocular surfaces of 16 eyes were disinfected with 1:100 povidone-iodine solution. Bacterial growth initially present in 10 of 16 eyes was present in 1 eye after disinfection and consisted of a single colony of E coli. After eyes were disinfected with 1:10, 1:50, or 1:100 povidone-iodine solutions, there was no evidence of corneal epithelial edema or sloughing. In 15 eyes subjected to disinfection with the 1:2 dilution, one instance of epithelial corneal edema was noticed. A 1:50 dilution of povidone-iodine is recommended as an ocular surface disinfectant for use in presurgical situations.
TI  - The adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli on cotton, polyester and their blends.
AB  - The adherent behaviour of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli on cotton, polyester and their blends through contact in aqueous suspensions was studied. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found to adhere to fabrics much more so than Staph. aureus. The adherence of both Staph. epidermidis and Staph. aureus to fabrics increased as the content of polyester fibres in the fabrics increased. The attachment of E. coli to all fabrics was very low and was not affected by the fibre contents. Total numbers of adherent bacteria on cotton and polyester fabrics were related directly to the concentrations of the bacterial suspensions. The extents of adherence, expressed by the percentage of adherent bacteria from the suspension, however, were independent of the concentration. The length of contact with bacteria was also found to affect the adherence of bacteria on fabrics studied.
TI  - Plasmid-encoded trimethoprim resistance in staphylococci.
AB  - High-level (greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to the antimicrobial agent trimethoprim was found in 17 of 101 (17%) coagulase-negative staphylococci and 5 of 51 (10%) Staphylococcus aureus from a number of different hospitals in the United States. Resistance was plasmid encoded and could be transferred by conjugation in 4 of the 17 (24%) Tpr coagulase-negative staphylococci and 3 of the 5 (60%) Tpr S. aureus. A 1.2-kilobase segment of plasmid DNA from one of the plasmids (pG01) was cloned on a high-copy-number vector in Escherichia coli and expressed high-level Tpr (MIC, 1,025 micrograms/ml) in the gram-negative host. In situ filter hybridization demonstrated homology between the cloned Tpr gene probe and plasmid DNA from each conjugative Tpr plasmid, a single nonconjugative plasmid from a United States Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, a nonconjugative plasmid from an Australian methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolate, and chromosomal DNA from three Tpr S. epidermidis isolates that did not contain any plasmid DNA that was homologous with the probe. No homology was seen between the probe and staphylococcal plasmids not mediating Tpr, plasmid DNA from 12 Tpr S. epidermidis isolates not transferring Tpr by conjugation, or plasmid-encoded Tpr genes derived from gram-negative bacteria. Plasmid-encoded Tpr appears to be a relatively new gene in staphylococci and, because it can be transferred by conjugation, could become more prevalent in nonsocomial isolates.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to vascular prostheses. A determinant of graft infectivity.
AB  - An in vitro model was developed to quantitatively measure bacterial adherence to  the surface of prosthetic vascular graft material. Four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, nonmucin-producing S. epidermidis [SP-2], mucin-producing S. epidermidis [RP-12], and Escherichia coli) were used to inoculate expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), woven Dacron, and velour knitted Dacron graft material. After graft specimens were incubated in a 10(7) suspension of bacteria, they were washed to remove nonadherent organisms and ultrasonically oscillated to dislodge adherent organisms. Quantitative culture of the sonication effluent was used to calculate bacterial adherence, expressed as the number of colony-forming units found in each square centimeter of graft material per 10(7) inoculum. All bacterial strains had a greater affinity to velour knitted Dacron graft than to ePTFE (p less than 0.025). E. coli and S. aureus adhered to velour knitted Dacron in greater numbers than to woven Dacron (p less than 0.04). The production of extracellular polysaccharide (mucin) by the RP-12 strain significantly increased adherence to both EPTFE and Dacron grafts compared with the other three bacterial strains tested (p less than 0.04). Although E. coli was less adherent to ePTFE than nonmucin-producing staphylococcal strains (S. aureus and SP-2), no difference in adherence to knitted or woven Dacron graft material was demonstrated. The differential adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts pays an important role in the pathogenesis of graft sepsis and determines relative graft infectivity. The in vitro model developed is well suited for further study of the mechanisms by which bacteria adhere to and colonize vascular grafts.
TI  - Survey of disc diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity testing in avian bacteriology  laboratories and the evaluation of a standardised method.
AB  - A survey was conducted in which 15 laboratories involved in avian bacteriology tested the antimicrobial sensitivity of cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes faecalis and Salmonella typhimurium, using the disc diffusion test as routinely practised in each laboratory. Up to 28 different antimicrobials or antimicrobial combinations were used. The most commonly tested agents were ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, furazolidone, neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamide, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide. Results between laboratories were compared according to the width of the zone of inhibition (annular radius) where 5 or more laboratories used the same disc content of a particular antimicrobial agent, and on whether a culture was interpreted as being sensitive or resistant to a particular agent. The variation in annular radii about the mean values were less than +/- 2 SD in 39.5% and greater than +/- 3 SD in 32.6% of 43 different antimicrobial/culture combinations involving 8 different agents. The range of annular radii measurements was greatest with trimethoprim/sulphonamide and streptomycin discs and with the S. epidermidis culture. Variation in the interpretation of test results was greatest with the Gram-negative bacteria, where for each of the more frequently tested agents at least one, commonly 2 and sometimes all 3 cultures were reported as sensitive and resistant to the same agent by different laboratories. The calibrated dichotomous sensitivity (CDS) test of Bell (1975, 1984) was evaluated as a standardised disc diffusion procedure and was found to be reproducible and accurate. Results obtained using antimicrobial agents calibrated for use in the CDS test were compared with results obtained in the survey using the same agents or agents showing identical resistance patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Self-disinfecting plastics for intravenous catheters and prosthetic inserts.
AB  - A disinfectant (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether: Irgasan, Ciba-Geigy) was incorporated into plastic washers fabricated from ethylvinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene, polypropylene or TPX. Plastics containing 0.2 and 2% Irgasan gave zones of inhibition on nutrient and blood agar plates seeded with micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis or Candida albicans) even after thorough washing. Exceptionally, C. albicans was inhibited only by 2% Irgasan, and EVA gave good inhibition only against the staphylococci. Similar washers of each plastic were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of rabbits; before insertion each was washed, had thread woven into it and was surrounded by a plasma clot containing 2 X 10(8) Staph. aureus. All the plastics without Irgasan gave rise to abscesses, none of the plastics impregnated with 2% Irgasan did, though from 2 out of 12 sites small numbers of Staph. aureus were isolated at post mortem. Using either clinical or bacteriological criteria, the results were highly significant (P less than 0.00001 and P less than 0.001 respectively), demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in preventing plastic-associated infection.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intrauterine devices (IUDs).
AB  - The bacterial colonizing of the intrauterine device (IUD) and its tail were studied in 152 IUDs obtained from 70 symptomless IUD wearers, 13 women with dysfunctional bleeding, 23 women with pelvic inflammatory disease, 31 women in whom the tail of an IUD was no longer visible and 17 women who were pregnant with an IUD in situ. The IUDs were either removed by the transcervical route or through a fundal incision in the uterus after hysterectomy. Most IUD were heavily contaminated by bacteria, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococci and anaerobic Lactobacilli. The number of colonies was higher in women with dysfunctional bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease than in others with a predominance of pathogenic bacteria, namely beta-hemolytic Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Almost half of the IUDs without a tail protruding through the cervix were sterile. With pregnancy in the presence of an IUD, 71% of devices grew bacteria which were mainly anaerobic.
TI  - Does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? A microbiological study.
AB  - In 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. Before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including Chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The Gram-positive aerobic cocci, Staph. epidermidis, Strept. faecalis and Strept. agalactiae as well as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. These microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. Staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. These three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. On the other hand, Strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. Since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.
TI  - Adherence of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains to human lung fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - The adherence to eukaryotic cells of Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and the yeast Candida albicans was studied by light microscopy with an in vitro micromethod involving different cell lines. The method is inexpensive, consumes little time and material, and is reproducible. It was used to show that the gram-positive Cowan I strain of S. aureus, which naturally forms protein A on its surface, adheres in much larger numbers to human lung fibroblasts than the protein A-free Wood 46 strain, the strain of S. epidermidis, and the encapsulated Smith strain. The presence of a capsule on the latter strain apparently prevented its attachment to the fibroblasts. Among the gram-negative species studied, a piliated clinical isolate of N. gonorrhoeae, displaying the opaque colonial phenotype, adhered in larger numbers than another isolate lacking pili and displaying the transparent phenotype. E. coli K12 attached slightly to the cell line, whereas P. aeruginosa adhered to it moderately. One strain of C. albicans tested did not attach in any detectable numbers. No clear correlation between bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, as evaluated by the hexadecane assay, and adherence to eukaryotic cells could be demonstrated for these microorganisms. With our method, bacterial attachment proceeded best at 37 degrees C and did not require more than 1 h of contact with the cell monolayer. The method described revealed differences in the adherence to eukaryotic cells, not only among species, but also between strains of the same species.
TI  - High risk of nosocomial infection in the pediatric critical care patient.
AB  - During this one-year prospective study, 61 (13.7%) of 444 patients admitted to the pediatric ICU at the University of Virginia Hospital developed nosocomial infections. By comparison, general medical/surgical ward patients had an overall 4.8% risk of acquiring an infection during their hospital stay. Patients who had prolonged ICU stays and those on plastic surgery, neurosurgery, and pediatric surgery services were more likely to become infected. The four bloodstream pathogens isolated in five episodes of hospital-acquired bacteremia were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia liquifaciens.
TI  - An in vitro study of the interaction between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activities of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), cefuroxime (CXM) and ceftizoxime (CTZ) were compared against 272 recent clinical isolates and the effect of CTX and DES in combination was studied using agar dilution checkerboards. CTX and CTZ had similar activity, inhibiting 90% of Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and Providence spp. at 0.0075 mg/l. Ninety percent of Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. were inhibited by 1 mg/l of CTX and CTZ. Ninety percent of staphylococci were inhibited by 4 mg/l of CTX, although CTZ was significantly less active against strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci had MICs for CTX of 32 and 128 mg/l respectively. DES had similar activity to CXM with MICs 2 to 5 dilutions less than CTX and CTZ. In checkerboard tests, synergy (FIC less than 0.5) between CTX and DES was demonstrated against 34% of isolates overall, with antagonism (FIC greater than 1) in 24%. CTX and DES were synergistic against 72% of staphylococci and 50% of enterococci. They were antagonistic against 81% of Enterobacter spp. and 62% of Serratia spp. although both species were susceptible to CTX alone. There was an additive effect or slight antagonism with 90% of Ps. aeruginosa. Other investigators have reported lower incidences of antagonism between CTX and DES: this could be due to variations among the collections of clinical isolates or methodologies used. The relevance of the in vitro interaction between CTX and its metabolite to the antimicrobial activity of CTX in vivo remains to be demonstrated.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Effect of 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, and vincristine on the antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotiam, piperacillin, and netilmicin.
AB  - Using the checkerboard agar dilution technique, antibacterial activity and in vitro interactions of 4 antineoplastic agents and 5 antimicrobial drugs were examined against 56 strains of 7 bacterial species. 5-fluorouracil was found to inhibit all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and of Staphylococcus epidermidis at a concentration of 0.8 micrograms/ml or less. 84% of all gram-negative strains were inhibited synergistically when 5-fluorouracil was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics. Methotrexate and cefotiam were antagonistic in 42% of all combinations, especially when tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Growth of bacteria and fungi in total nutrient admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing dextrose, amino acids, and fat emulsion were evaluated for their ability to support bacterial and fungal growth. The following solutions were tested: a standard adult total parenteral nutrient (TPN) solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a standard neonatal TPN solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a 10% fat emulsion, a 20% fat emulsion, a TNA with 40% of the total calories as fat, a TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a neonatal TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a control (fat emulsion was replaced with an equal amount of sterile water) for solution 5, and a control for solution 6. Serial dilutions of each solution were inoculated with 5 X 10(5) bacteria/mL or 5 X 10(3) fungi/mL, incubated, and visually rated on a scale of 0 (no growth) to 4 (maximal growth). Bacterial growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Group JK Corynebacterium was greater in the TNA solutions than in the control or standard TPN solutions. Escherichia coli, Candida tropicalis, and C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. Torulopsis glabrata grew better in solutions that did not contain fat emulsion. Growth characteristics did not differ significantly between the adult and neonatal (more dilute) solutions. The addition of fat emulsion to TPN solutions enhances the ability of these solutions to support bacterial growth; this possibility must be considered when evaluating patients for this type of total parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bovine neutrophils ingest but do not kill Haemophilus somnus in vitro.
AB  - Phagocytosis of Haemophilus somnus by bovine blood neutrophils required opsonization of the bacteria with antibodies against H. somnus. Few bacteria were phagocytosed in the absence of serum; in addition, absorption of immune serum with Formalin-killed H. somnus significantly reduced ingestion of H. somnus. Heat inactivation of antiserum (56 degrees C for 30 min) to eliminate complement activity had little effect on its ability to opsonize H. somnus for uptake by bovine neutrophils. Antiserum from an H. somnus-immunized calf and autologous sera from adult cattle supported equivalent phagocytosis of H. somnus by bovine neutrophils, suggesting that normal, healthy cattle may contain sufficient antibodies in their sera to facilitate phagocytosis of H. somnus. Although bovine neutrophils readily ingested H. somnus, they were unable to kill the bacterium in vitro. These same neutrophils readily killed opsonized Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that H. somnus is able to survive and perhaps multiply within bovine neutrophils. Because bovine neutrophils stimulated with opsonized H. somnus demonstrated a reduced oxidative burst (as measured by chemiluminescence) compared with neutrophils stimulated by opsonized E. coli, we suggest that reduced production of reactive oxygen intermediates during the phagocytosis of H. somnus may account, in part, for the enhanced survival of H. somnus in bovine neutrophils.
TI  - Infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. Infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. A variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. The exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. Susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may all play some role. Controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions, attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. In addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. Many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. Well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Infectious complications and cost-effectiveness of open resuscitation in the surgical intensive care unit after cardiac surgery.
AB  - From July, 1982, to May, 1984, 2,412 patients underwent cardiac surgery. Open resuscitation through a midline sternotomy was performed in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) 88 times in 64 patients one minute to 10 days after admission. There were 49 initial survivors; 31 patients had primary closure in the SICU (Group 1), and 18 patients had delayed closure (Group 2). In Group 1 there was 1 death. Wound infection developed in 2 of the 30 survivors--Escherichia coli in 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1. The latter required subsequent debridement. In Group 2 there were 8 survivors and no wound infections. Fifteen patients could not be resuscitated because of ventricular arrhythmia (13%), asystole (33%), cardiogenic shock (47%), and tamponade (7%). Only 2 of 38 patients, or 5%, experienced wound infections. This study demonstrates that open resuscitation in the SICU is a safe, rapid, and cost-effective procedure that will allow earlier intervention, diagnosis, and treatment. In no instance was death attributed to wound infection, and at our institution, this method resulted in cost savings of more than $1,000 per patient.
TI  - The influence of skeletal implants on incidence of infection. Experiments in a canine model.
AB  - We have performed experiments in 187 dogs in order to evaluate the effect of commonly used implant materials on rate of infection. We opened the femoral canal with a hand drill and awl, instilled a suspension of bacteria, and then inserted one of the implants. The implants--stainless-steel and cobalt-chromium alloys, high-density polyethylene, prepolymerized polymethylmethacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate polymerized in vivo--were compared with no implant (control). The effect of the different implants on the incidence of infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli was compared by determining the number of bacteria required to produce infection in 50 per cent of the femora. All of the implants were significantly more likely than the controls to be associated with infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Polymethylmethacrylate polymerized in vivo was found to be significantly more likely than all other implants to be associated with infection with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition to evaluating all specimens bacteriologically, we carried out a histological evaluation, and found that infection was highly correlated with an increased inflammatory response for all three bacteria. However, even with this highly statistically significant correlation, the correlation was not absolute; when only limited portions of randomly selected specimens of tissue were examined, the correlation was reduced.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Liposomes-mycobacteria incubation systems as a partial model of host-parasite interaction at cell membrane level.
AB  - The multilamellar lecithin-cholesterol liposomes entrapping carboxyfluorescence as a specific marker were prepared to be incubated with mycobacteria. The extent of resulting liposomal lysis was measured by marker release. Mycobacteria were highly active in this respect regardless of the species. Staphylococci were much less active and E. coli was completely inactive. Molecular species of lecithin and their ratio to cholesterol were related with the liposome sensitivity to mycobacteria. Ultrastructural and biochemical study showed that liposomes can be in close contact with mycobacteria and lecithins are degraded so that released fatty acids are incorporated into bacterial lipids, especially in virulent species. Liposomes-mycobacteria interaction was discussed as a partial model of the phagocyte-parasite interaction at the membrane level.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - Worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of 72 patients with a variety of obstetric and gynecologic infections is reviewed. Clinical cure or improvement occurred in 97% of 72 assessable patients. The most common etiologic pathogens were Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococci, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus. Of the recovered pathogens, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem/cilastatin. Bacteriologic response was also excellent and none of the pathogens acquired resistance to imipenem. Most patients tolerated intravenous administration of imipenem/cilastatin well to moderately well.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - [Gram staining of histological sections].
AB  
TI  - Culture of the surfaces of urinary catheters to sample urethral flora and study the effect of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - At the time indwelling urinary catheters were removed, the urethral flora was sampled by rolling the catheters onto culture plates. Cultures were obtained from 398 patients with sterile urine. Catheter surfaces were colonized less often in males than in females (16.8 and 67.0%, respectively) and yielded correspondingly fewer bacterial species per catheter. In both sexes, gram-positive species were isolated more frequently than gram-negative species (428 and 131 isolates, respectively). The bacteria most commonly isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus was not recovered despite the large proportion of young, sexually active women in the study population. Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, gradually colonized the catheters over time but at all times were recovered in lower amounts the gram-positive organisms and less often in males than in females. Slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not relate to the density of organisms recovered from the catheters or influence the presence of gram-negative bacteria. Despite frequent use of antibiotics in this population, the urethral flora remained highly susceptible to these drugs. Antibacterial activity was not detected on the catheters despite high concentrations in the urine. This suggests that systemic antibiotics have a very limited effect on resident urethral flora. Despite relatively small numbers in the urethra, gram-negative bacteria readily produce urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of bacterial sepsis in the newborn infant.
AB  - Septicemia continues to be an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The bacteria most commonly responsible are group B beta-hemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli, but regional differences exist. Recently sepsis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis has occurred with increasing frequency in several neonatal intensive care units. Other organisms are less commonly responsible. The choice of antibiotics for suspected sepsis is based on the possible organisms involved and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns, which vary from hospital to hospital and at different times in the same hospital. Currently recommended initial therapy consists of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside, usually ampicillin and gentamicin. The addition of vancomycin is indicated when staphylococcal septicemia is suspected. During outbreaks of neonatal sepsis caused by aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacteria, the use of third-generation cephalosporins or acylaminopenicillins may be appropriate, depending on the results of susceptibility tests. Continuing efforts to develop antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsis are warranted.
TI  - Clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - The Roche Septi-Chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and C. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (P less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. Staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli (P less than 0.05), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (P less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. The overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.
TI  - Effect of fibronectin on adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to fibrin thrombi in  vitro.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus binds to purified fibronectin in solution and may bind to fibronectin present in wound tissue. When incorporated into a solid fibrin thrombus, however, plasma fibronectin may fail to bind S. aureus, because the S. aureus-binding sites on fibronectin may be occupied by fibrin. Both S. aureus and fibrin bind to the same 27-kilodalton amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin. To determine whether fibronectin incorporated into fibrin still promotes the adherence of S. aureus, we clotted citrated normal plasma and fibronectin-depleted plasma onto petri dishes. We then measured bacterial adherence to these in vitro fibrin thrombi. We found that the adherence of five of seven S. aureus strains decreased significantly (by 26 to 58%) when fibronectin had been depleted from the fibrin thrombi. Adding fibronectin back reversed this decrease in adherence. The reversal was dose dependent; the increase was in proportion to the amount of fibronectin added back to the plasma. Bacteria known not to bind to fibronectin (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis) adhered 100-fold less than S. aureus, and their adherence was unaffected by the absence of fibronectin in the fibrin thrombus. We conclude that fibronectin incorporated into solid fibrin thrombi does mediate the adherence of most S. aureus strains to fibrin thrombi. Fibronectin may be an important molecule that mediates the adherence of S. aureus to fibrin in wounds.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of Trypticase soy broth in agar slide and conventional blood culture systems.
AB  - A commercially available biphasic blood culture system that utilizes an attachable agar slide paddle and Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) was compared with a conventional Trypticase soy broth blood culture bottle in 6,867 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., other Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more anaerobic bacteria of importance were recovered in the conventional bottle (P less than 0.01). Staphylococci (P less than 0.001), gram-negative facultative and aerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas pneumococci (P less than 0.05) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. Of 603 clinically important microorganisms that grew in the biphasic system, 601 (99.7%) were detected by day 7 of incubation, but only 403 of 490 microorganisms (82.2%) were detected by day 7 in the conventional bottle. Overall, the biphasic system was superior to the conventional bottle. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the biphasic system should be used in conjunction with a complementary anaerobic conventional bottle.
TI  - Growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition mixtures and related clinical observations.
AB  - The effect of lipid addition to TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) solutions on microbial growth was investigated. Staphylococcus epidermidis, which failed to grow or grew poorly in the absence of lipid, reached greater than 10(4) cfu/ml (colony forming units per ml), from an initial inoculum of approximately 50 cfu/ml after 24 h when lipid was added. Candida albicans grew more slowly in the presence of lipid, but nevertheless reached 10(4) cfu/ml after 40 h incubation. Klebsiella aerogenes grew readily in all solutions, whereas Escherichia coli failed to grow in any solution. Growth of S. epidermidis and K. aerogenes was improved when the inoculum consisted of starved cells; however, growth of starved cells of C. albicans lagged behind that of unstarved cells. The ability of S. epidermidis to grow in lipid-containing TPN mixtures is particularly important, since this organism is frequently associated with sepsis. In an infant surgical unit, where TPN is under the care of a nutrition team, samples of TPN fluids and giving sets were examined for microbiological contamination at the end of the 24 h administration period. Contamination was found in eight of the 98 systems examined from eight patients. The organisms were identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroids.
TI  - Symposium on infections in the compromised host. The leukemias.
AB  - The treatment of acute leukemia in the adult causes prolonged and profound granulocytopenia. When the patient has less than 100 granulocytes per microliter, the risk of life-threatening infection is extremely high. Major infections include bacteremia, pneumonia, pharyngitis, esophagitis, colitis, perianal or perirectal lesions, and cellulitis. The major organisms are gram-negative bacilli (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts (Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata), and the filamentous fungi (Aspergillus flavus and fumigatus). Infection prevention includes the return to normal of the patient's host defense mechanisms, reduction of invasive procedures which breach body barriers, and methods to decrease the acquisition of potential pathogens, and to reduce the number of organisms colonizing the patient.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in American hospitals.
AB  - A total of 5,825,243 strains of bacteria were isolated in 242 American hospitals  during a period of twelve years (1971 to 1982). The susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp. Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. did not change significantly during this period of time. The susceptibility to tetracycline for E. coli and S. aureus increased. Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed a decrease in susceptibility.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody AHN-1 inhibits phagocytosis by human neutrophils.
AB  - The granulocyte-specific monoclonal antibody, AHN-1, immunoprecipitates two major surface-iodinated proteins of 105,000 and 145,000 to 150,000 daltons from normal human neutrophils. In this study, the effect of AHN-1 on a number of neutrophil functions was evaluated in vitro. Both complement- and antibody-mediated phagocytosis were inhibited when human neutrophils were pretreated with AHN-1 and opsonized bacteria were used as targets. The inhibition of phagocytosis was specific, in that lysosomal enzyme release and chemotaxis were not altered by treatment with AHN-1. AHN-1 did inhibit superoxide production by neutrophils in response to particulate stimuli, but not in response to the soluble stimulus, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The data indicate that one or both of these surface proteins may be important in the process of phagocytosis. AHN-1 should be useful in isolating and further characterizing the nature of these molecules.
TI  - Bacterial flora of clinically normal conjunctivae in the domestic duckling.
AB  - A total of 100 eyes from newly hatched and young domestic ducklings were swabbed  and the bacterial flora determined by standard bacteriological culture methods. Of the total number of bacteria isolated, 57% were gram negative suggesting that the majority were derived from the intestinal flora. Only 2% of the eyes sampled showed no bacterial growth. The bacterial species most commonly cultured were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter anitratus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-haemolytic Streptococci, micrococcus spp., a-haemolytic Streptococci and Acinetobacter lwoffii. More than one bacterial species was found in the majority of eyes. A. anitratus was isolated almost exclusively from 1 day old ducklings while A. lwoffii was mainly isolated from pen-reared ducklings. Chlamydia psittaci was not isolated from any of the conjunctivae sampled.
TI  - An epidemiological survey of urinary tract infections among outpatients in Northern Norway.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) in all outpatients from several municipalities in  Northern Norway were examined during 1 year. Comparatively high frequencies of UTI were found among women of all ages, among people greater than 60 years of both sexes, in coastline municipalities, and during the fall and winter. About 70% of all UTI were caused by Escherichia coli, more in women than in men. Other gram-negative enterobacteria (Klebsiella, Proteus) and gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis) caused the majority of remaining infections. Relatively more gram-positive cocci (except Staph. saprophyticus) than gram-negative enterobacteria were from males. Patients with gram-positive cocci, except Strep. faecalis, were generally younger than those with gram-negative enterobacteria.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Chlormethine in small doses as immunostimulator--LPS synergism.
AB  - Normothermic rabbits and rabbits with LPS induced fever were treated with chlormethine (Nitrogranulogen, Ntg) in the doses of 1 microgram/kg and 10 micrograms/kg. The blood was collected 4, 24, 48 hrs and 4, 7, 10 days after Ntg injection. Following indices of immunity were studied: T and B cells number, number of IgM producing cells after immunization with SRBC, serum IgG level, killing activity of neutrophils and number of phagocytized bacteria. It was observed that both doses of Ntg injected intravenously to normothermic rabbits, significantly increased the number of T and B lymphocytes and of IgM producing lymphocytes a well as the level of IgG in the serum, number of phagocytized bacteria and killing activity of neutrophils. Ntg in combination with LPS shortened the period of fever, and through the synergistic effect, significantly increased T lymphocytes number in the blood, IgG level in the serum, number of phagocytized bacteria and killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Single-dose cefotetan for urinary tract infection.
AB  - Seven female patients with lower urinary tract infection were treated with a single 2 g intramuscular dose of cefotetan. Six patients were clinically cured when seen 1 week after treatment and 5 patients remained well at 4 weeks after treatment. One patient developed loose stools and a vulval rash, 1 patient developed soreness and induration at the site of injection. There were no other side-effects.
TI  - Shunt infections: prevention and treatment.
AB  
TI  - Clinical evaluation of temocillin in urinary tract infections.
AB  - A group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. The diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). The causative organisms were Escherichia coli (n = 20). Proteus species (n = 9). Klebsiella species (n = 4). Streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and Providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. In acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. The drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. Also, Candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. Temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine culture are available.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against clinical bacterial isolates  in Nigeria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, recently introduced in Nigeria was compared with the activities of other related beta-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cephaloridine, cloxacillin/ampicillin and ampicillin against 530 local clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The spectra of activity and potency of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were generally similar against the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Streptococcus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis when compared to cefotaxime. All the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested were less active than ceftriaxone. The action of ceftriaxone was bactericidal and the minimum inhibitory concentration values observed with R-plasmid beta-lactamase mediated resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and N. gonorrhoeae strains did not exceed the maximum value obtained with the beta-lactamase-negative strains.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - [A clinical survey of bacteria isolated from urine specimens of patients with various urological disease].
AB  - We have clinically surveyed the distribution and disk sensitivity of bacterial strains obtained from urine of patients with various urological disease at our department during three (1975-1977) and four (1980-1983) years. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated (29.4%) from the outpatients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.5%), Pseudomonas cepacia (11.2%) and Serratia marcescens (11.2%). Pseudomonas cepacia was the most frequently isolated (28.0%) from the inpatients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.3%) and Serratia marcescens (15.9%). Pseudomonas cepacia which has been increasing was first isolated in 1977 and Serratia marcescens in 1976. They have become the main bacteria causing infections in our hospital. Pseudomonas cepacia was frequently isolated after postoperative prophylactic chemotherapy and Serratia marcescens in the late period of admission. The majority of Pseudomonas cepacia was resistant to all agents except chloramphenicol and doxycycline. Serratia marcescens was also resistant except to gentamicin and doxycycline. In Escherichia coli species, resistant strains increased gradually but they have good sensitivity to gentamicin, dibekacin, colistin and doxycycline. Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from outpatients had good sensitivity to all agents but increased in incidence of resistant strains isolated from inpatients.
TI  - Comparison of fortimicins with other aminoglycosides and effects on bacterial ribosome and protein synthesis.
AB  - Fortimicins are bicyclic aminoglycoside antibiotics that contain a fortamine moiety instead of the deoxystreptamine found in other aminoglysides. Fortimicin A had a bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis and was found to inhibit protein synthesis in vivo. In vitro, fortimicin A inhibited polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine polymerization and induced misreading, as shown by leucine incorporation. In contrast, fortimicin B had no effect on either polymerization or misreading. In assays programmed with natural mRNA, only a weak polymerization inhibition effect was observed with fortimicin A, whereas a strong stimulation was seen in the presence of fortimicin B. Both fortimicins A and B inhibited dissociation of 70S ribosomes into their subunits and neither was able to displace [3H]dihydrostreptomycin, [3H]tobramycin, or [3H]gentamicin from their respective binding sites on the 70S particle.
TI  - The infected hip after total hip arthroplasty.
AB  - We studied the cases of fifty-two patients with an infection at the site of a prosthetic total hip replacement, and are reporting the significant clinical features, infecting organisms, methods of treatment, and results at long-term follow-up. Forty-eight per cent of the hips had had an operation prior to the index arthroplasty, and 42 per cent had a wound complication. All patients had pain in the infected hip, but only 54 per cent had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than thirty millimeters per hour, 44 per cent had fever, and 15 per cent had leukocytosis. In 88 per cent of the patients a single organism was grown on culture, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli were present in about 75 per cent. When antibiotic therapy alone was the initial treatment, the infection was eradicated in only one patient. Excisional arthroplasty was the definitive surgical procedure in thirty-three patients and the infection was eradicated in twenty-seven of them, but the clinical result was satisfactory in only twenty. Of ten patients who had a true Girdlestone arthroplasty, none had recurrence of the infection and all had a clinically satisfactory outcome.
TI  - Intradermal injection of Propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  - The intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of Propionibacterium acnes (CN 6134)  into the ears of female Sprague-Dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with formation of acneiform lesions. Inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. At 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. Histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. Pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. By day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. Three isolates of P. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain CN 6134. In these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. In contrast, samples of Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli B, and Staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. Benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of P. acnes CN 6134-induced ear thickening. The corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. The specificity for P. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - Wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  - The antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and Enterobacter spp. All of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with MICs ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3H]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, DNA was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. This suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial DNA.
TI  - Bacterial growth and killing in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis fluids.
AB  - We determined the ability of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli to survive and grow in peritoneal dialysis fluids from patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Staphylococci did not survive in commercially available dialysis solutions but grew readily in peritoneal effluents obtained from patients after the dialysis dwell time. The number of CFU doubled 6 and 13 times in 24 h for S. epidermidis and S. aureus, respectively. E. coli grew well in both the pre- and postdialysis peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal macrophages as well as peripheral blood leukocytes inhibited bacterial growth in peritoneal dialysis fluid. However, 10(6) phagocytes per ml were minimally required to obtain a bacteriostatic effect. The addition of serum to peritoneal dialysis fluid increased the antibacterial activity of macrophages and blood leukocytes. The capacity of the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin to reduce bacterial CFU in peritoneal dialysis fluid was only 10% of its bactericidal capacity in standard Mueller-Hinton brush. Peritoneal dialysis fluid had no effect on the antibacterial activity of imipenem.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Swedish university hospital: a one-year prospective study in 1981 and a comparison with 1975-76.
AB  - A one-year prospective study of bacteremia was carried out at a Swedish university hospital. Blood cultures were taken in 6.3% of all patients admitted to the hospital. 148 episodes of bacteremia were recorded in 142 patients, 59% of whom were males. The mean incidence of bacteremia was 4.3 episodes per 1,000 admissions. The incidence of contamination was 1.3%. Malignancy and urinary tract disorders were the most common diagnoses and surgical intervention, central venous catheters and cytostatic drugs the most common predisposing factors. The ratio of hospital to community-acquired bacteremia was 1.3:1. The fatality rate was 12.7%. Gram-negative rods belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae were the most common pathogens, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the causative bacteria was quite favorable. No S. aureus strains were resistant to isoxazolyl penicillins or gentamicin. No Klebsiella strain and only one Escherichia coli strain was resistant to gentamicin. The results were compared to a one-year retrospective study carried out in the same hospital five years ago. The incidence of bacteremia had not increased between the two studies.
TI  - Aminoglycoside resistance among blood culture isolates.
AB  - A total of 633 blood culture isolates were collected from 1981 to 1982 from seven major Finnish hospitals, including all university central hospitals. Susceptibility of the strains to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and netilmicin was determined by the Sensititre microtiter procedure. Resistance against any of these agents occurred in 1.3 to 6.5% of all strains studied. In the Turku University Central Hospital, an increased number of tobramycin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were found; the frequency of strains resistant to tobramycin was 57% and to gentamicin was 29% versus frequencies of 16 and 18%, respectively, which were observed in the other hospitals. An explanation for this might be a change in the use of aminoglycosides in the Turku University Central Hospital; within 3 years, 1979 to 1981, the consumption of tobramycin and amikacin had increased 330 and 290%, respectively, whereas the use of gentamicin had decreased to 24% of that in the beginning of the period. Resistance against tobramycin was mediated by enzymes APH(2")-AAC(6') and ANT(4').
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of azlocillin and carbenicillin against 856 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - Eight hundred and fifty-six strains of more than ten species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp and Acinetobacter spp, were tested by the disc diffusion method against azlocillin and carbenicillin. Azlocillin was found to be superior to carbenicillin against Pseudomonas spp, and more than 90% of the tested strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values well below the serum levels attainable after recommended doses of azlocillin. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive cocci, however, azlocillin seemed to have little to offer.
TI  - [Concept of class in relation to first-generation cephalosporins].
AB  - The authors consider differences in answer of the first generation cephalosporins against several strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and suggest a revision of the "class" concept as regards sensitivity response of the above mentioned cephalosporins.

AB  
TI  - Relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  - Objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. Approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo) infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. Relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. Largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important economically, but average differences were much smaller. Selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.
TI  - Influence of ethanol with and without chlorhexidine on the bacterial colonization of the umbilicus of newborn infants.
AB  - The effect of daily treatments with 70% ethanol and with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol, respectively, on navel colonization in newborns has been studied in 624 infants in two maternity wards during a four-month period. Staphylococcus aureus, group B and G streptococci, E. coli and anaerobes were significantly less often isolated from newborns whose umbilical cord was treated with chlorhexidine in ethanol than from those treated with ethanol only. Staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococci, on the other hand, were significantly more often isolated from the chlorhexidine-ethanol than from the ethanol group. More infants without colonization of the umbilicus on their fourth day of life were found in the chlorhexidine in ethanol than in the ethanol group. The infants in the ethanol group were colonized with significantly more bacterial species than the infants in the other group. Signs of dissemination of group B and group G streptococci between babies were seen more often in the group of infants treated with ethanol than in the one treated with chlorhexidine-ethanol.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - Efficacy of a topical antibiotic irrigant in decreasing or eliminating bacterial  contamination in surgical wounds.
AB  - Using a simple in vitro system, the authors showed that colony counts of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas species can be reduced by 12%-56% with saline irrigation; the reduction of colony numbers, however, especially for S. aureus, was not always statistically significant. However, even if it were statistically significant, the amount of reduction would not be clinically significant. A topical antibiotic irrigant containing bacitracin/neomycin was effective against S. aureus, S. epidermidis-, and E. coli-treated agar plates. Except for a single plate containing Pseudomonas organisms, the growth of Pseudomonas colonies was also prevented by antibiotic irrigation. Tissue samples of muscle, fat, and bone obtained during operation showed antibiotic levels comparable with, and in most cases greater than, those found in the blood agar plates. These data may be clinically significant and suggest that bacitracin/neomycin irrigation can be safely used to reduce the incidence of postoperative infection.
TI  - [Some components of preputial bacterial flora in the ram].
AB  - During the reproductive period the AA have carried on bacteriological researches  in the preputial cavity in eight sardinian rams, without pathological processes, living in eight flocks in the country around Sassari, in order to detect the bacteriological flora. This flora could interfere both with fertility and with conservation of seminal material for artificial insemination. Three withdrawals have been carried on before, during and after the reproduction season. E.coli, P. mirabilis, Staph. epidermidis have been found in the varius examined subjects. The AA stress that the same bacterium which had been isolated in the first withdrawal. Moreover in some subjects the bacteriological flora had increased. The AA stress how these data can be useful in order to control the flock fertility and in order to improve the technology of conservation of seminal material.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - Opsonic deficiency of peritoneal dialysis effluent in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis frequently complicates the clinical course of patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Since bacterial opsonization is critical to the effective defense of the peritoneal cavity by phagocytic cells, we prospectively evaluated the opsonic activity of peritoneal dialysis effluent obtained from 17 CAPD patients during 102 patient months. Samples of peritoneal dialysis effluent contained concentrations of opsonins against S. epidermidis that were less than 2% of that observed in serum. Moreover, heat-labile opsonic activity against Escherichia coli was absent from all dialysis effluents. During the study, there were ten episodes of peritonitis in nine CAPD patients (1 per 10.2 patient months). S. epidermidis was isolated in seven episodes, a gram-negative bacillus in one, and two episodes were culture negative. the incidence of S. epidermidis peritonitis was 1 per 62 patient months in the patients with "high" peritoneal dialysis effluent opsonic activity against S. epidermidis but was nearly tenfold greater in patients with "low" opsonic activity (1 per 6.7 patient months). We conclude that peritoneal dialysis effluent opsonic activity predicts which CAPD patients are at an increased risk to develop S. epidermidis peritonitis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.
TI  - Cervical-vaginal bacterial flora in patients with cervical carcinoma treated with irradiation and febrile morbidity during intracavitary radium therapy.
AB  - The cervical-vaginal bacterial flora of 57 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix were found to be identical to those reported in studies of different population groups, except for a lower frequency of anaerobic bacteria. Radiation suppressed significantly both the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Following 4,000 rads of external irradiation, 47.4% of the cervical cultures were bacteriologically sterile. During the first and second radium treatment, 21% and 25.5% of the patients respectively developed fever of 38 degrees C or more, the cause of which could not definitely be established. The significance of fever during radium treatment is discussed.

TI  - Polyamino acid enhancement of bacterial phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Cationic polyamino acids are known to enhance a variety of cell-cell interactions by virtue of their ability to alter electrostatic forces of cell surfaces. In this study, the effect of polyamino acids on phagocytosis of 3H-labeled bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and peritoneal macrophages was investigated. Negatively charged and neutral polyamino acids did not influence phagocytosis of unopsonized Staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas protamine, poly-L-arginine, and poly-L-lysine stimulated phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. At 50 micrograms/ml, greater than 30% uptake by PMNs was seen with each of these cationic polyamino acids. Although cationic polyamino acids promoted PMN and peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis of unopsonized S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus M (encapsulated) and M variant (unencapsulated), and Escherichia coli J5, little effect was seen with the parent E. coli O111:B4 or a serotype O222:H16 strain. Pretreatment of bacteria and phagocytes separately demonstrated that the phagocytosis-promoting property of polyamino acids is manifest predominantly on the bacteria. Bacteria pretreated with cationic polyamino acids also elicited a PMN chemiluminescent response, and PMN-associated bacteria were killed, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. Thus, cationic polyamino acids promote the phagocytosis and killing of many but not all bacterial strains, and in this respect polyamino acids function as opsonins.
TI  - In vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. Netilmicin combinations were least active. On gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. No antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
TI  - Species distribution and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated pre- and postoperatively from patients undergoing transurethral prostatic resection.
AB  - The identity and antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria from 179 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate were analysed. The patients were randomized into a group receiving a short course of cefotaxime in conjunction with the operation and a control group given no antibiotics. Preoperatively 70 patients had bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/l) with a predominance of Gram-negative bacteria (57 isolates, mainly Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella ssp, Proteus ssp), although Gram-positive species (24 isolates, mainly enterococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were also frequently encountered. Preoperatively isolated pathogens were evenly distributed in both groups and the sensitivity pattern was comparable. In the cefotaxime group postoperative recurrence of the preoperatively identified bacteria occurred in a lower frequency (11/43) than persistence in the control group (24/38). Only Gram-negative pathogens were isolated from patients with postoperative septicemia and upper urinary tract infections indicating that it is most important to direct prophylaxis against Gram-negative bacteria. A high degree of sensitivity against cefotaxime, gentamicin, trimethoprim, co-trimazine and a combination of ampicillin and mecillinam was recorded among both pre- and postoperatively isolated bacteria.

TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Urethral meatal colonization in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated bacteriuria.
AB  - Urethral meatal colonization with potential urinary tract pathogens was studied before bacteriuria in 31 consecutive acute spinal cord injury patients on an open ward (137 cultures) and 18 renal homotransplant patients in reverse isolation (80 cultures). All patients required indwelling urethral catheterization and no antimicrobials were given. Daily quantitative cultures of the urethral meatus, and bladder and drainage bag urine were obtained. The urethra was the source for 11 of 31 episodes of bacteriuria (35 per cent). Urethral meatal colonization with the organism responsible for bacteriuria, that is Escherichia coli (5 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), was persistent and present from 2 to 5 days before bacteriuria. In each ward 81 per cent or more of the cultures obtained on day 1 of catheterization showed no gram-negative colonization. Subsequently, the gram-negative colonization density increased in both groups but the increase was significant (p less than 0.001) only for patients on the open ward. Similar trends were observed for gram-positive colonization. The prevalence of potential pathogens was similar for patients whether or not they suffered bacteriuria. An increased density of bacterial colonization was associated with increased susceptibility to bacteriuria but the specific urethral meatal flora was not always predictive of the species responsible for bacteriuria.
TI  - [UV irradiation of the peritoneal dialysis solution for the prevention of peritonitis].
AB  - Micro-organisms causing peritonitis during peritoneal dialysis or CAPD can reach  the peritoneal cavity either along the Tenckhoff-catheter or via contaminated dialysis fluid. Laboratory experiments with UV irradiation of artificially contaminated CAPD fluid were made to demonstrate whether decontamination could be achieved during the flow through a UV-penetrable (lambda 2537 A) section of the CAPD catheter. Five CAPD bags were contaminated with a fluid culture of the following micro-organisms which frequently cause peritonitis (S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Candida albicans). After UV irradiation positive cultures could not be demonstrated. UV irradiation of the peritoneal dialysis fluid before entering the peritoneal cavity is proposed as an additional preventive measure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity studies of flavonoids from Salvia palaestina.
AB  - Ten aglycones and six glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were identified from the leaves of Salvia palaestina Bentham (Labiatae). Among them cirsimaritin showed a high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the others have little or no activity against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - [Bacterial species recently isolated from urinary tract infections and their antibiotic susceptibility, with special reference to acute cystitis].
AB  - Numbers of the strains of each bacterial species isolated from urinary tract infections were summed and their incidences were calculated for each a half year from the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982. The incidences of Escherichia coli strains were found to be greatly reduced and those of Streptococcus faecalis strains were greatly increased. Those of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were also increased. This trend was thought to be caused by the extensive and exclusive use of cephalosporin derivatives. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), latamoxef (LMOX) and minocycline (MINO) against these isolated strains were estimated. The most sensitive drugs for E. coli were found to be CZX, LMOX, GM and AMK, CZX and MINO for Klebsiella, CZX and LMOX for Proteus, and GM for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All Gram-positive cocci were found generally to be most susceptible to MINO, but S. faecalis and other Pseudomonas were also sensitive to ABPC. Exclusive use of cephalosporins for the treatment may induce selective increases of the resistant species in normal flora. Since these flora could be the causative agents for various infections, these selections caused by the exclusive use of the monotype drugs are not preferable, and various different drugs should be used for the suitable cases.
TI  - Survey of bacteriologic flora of conjunctiva and cornea in healthy psittacine birds.
AB  - A total of 151 eyes from healthy psittacine birds were examined by bacteriologic  cultural methods. Bacterial growth was not found in 41% of eyes cultured, Staphylococcus epidermidis was found in 25%, alpha-hemolytic streptococci in 25%, Corynebacterium spp in 7%, and Staphylococcus aureus in 5%. Each of the following organisms were found in 1% of the eyes; Pasteurella spp, Actinobacillus spp, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp, Proteus spp, and Bacillus spp. More than one bacterial species was found in numerous eyes. Psittacines from an import station had a greater occurrence of ocular bacterial growth than did birds from private owners. The frequency of ocular bacterial growth and types of bacteria isolated were similar to studies from dogs and cats.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  - Since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. Addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. However, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. Growth in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). Addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. The results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - [Cefotiam passage into the maxillary sinus tissues].
AB  - Clinical study was made on cefotiam (CTM) and the following results were obtained. Tissue concentrations of CTM were determined 1 hour after intravenous injection (CTM 1 g) in chronic sinusitis and maxillary cyst. Concentrations of CTM were 16.53 micrograms/g, 13.26 micrograms/g in mucosa of the maxillary sinus, maxillary cyst, respectively. Antibacterial activity of CTM was measured on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus, Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; that were isolated from pus of maxillary sinus. The highest MIC on them was 3.13 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine and the antimicrobial agents gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cefalothin, cefotiam and cefsulodin.
AB  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, cefotiam or cefsulodin, used against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was determined by measuring the effect of the drugs and combination of drugs on growth of the bacteria in an automated turbidimeter. The combination of drugs was considered to be synergistic when the growth inhibiting effect of the combination was greater than that of the combined action of each of the drugs separately. Deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid together with either gentamicin or cefsulodin showed synergy in 10 out of 10, and 5 out of 6 cultures respectively, whereas deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid with chloramphenicol, cephalothin or cefotiam was synergistic in 6 out of 14, 5 out of 11, and 3 out of 6 cultures. This synergistic effect was much lower when microorganisms were incubated with deferoxamine combined with the various antibiotics but without ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid alone had no synergistic effect. When deferoxamine was saturated with iron, its antibacterial effect was completely abolished.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in intensive care unit areas.
AB  - The incidence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance rates of nosocomial pathogens vary considerably among countries and even among intensive care units (ICUs) within one hospital. Such differences might be partly due to the selection pressure exerted by certain antibiotics, since intensive care patients are given more antimicrobials than any other group of patients. We therefore compared resistance rates of four important nosocomial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients in general wards and ICUs. There were few trends toward higher resistance of ICU isolates, and most differences were found with Klebsiella pneumoniae. We also tried to relate antibiotic use in ICUs and frequency of antibiotic resistance of five selected nosocomial pathogens. The ampicillin and cephalosporin resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae arose along with an increase in usage of both drugs. Decreasing prescription of cotrimoxazole was not reflected by decrease in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Increasing prescriptions of tetracyclines were followed by an increasing resistance of E. coli, but not of Staphylococci. The oxacillin resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis almost paralleled the consumption, the opposite was true for Staphylococcus aureus. There seemed to be a rather close relationship between the incidence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and the quantities of gentamicin, tobramycin and azlocillin prescribed. The increase or decrease of prescriptions of certain antimicrobials increased or decreased their resistance rate to the respective drugs of only certain bacterial strains in one ICU, but not in the other. The findings in our hospital cannot necessarily be applied to other hospitals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Neonatal infections. An important determinant of late NICU mortality in infants less than 1,000 g at birth.
AB  - For a 24-month period (1977 through 1978), the determinants of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) mortality were examined retrospectively in 133 consecutively admitted newborn infants who weighed less than 1,000 g at birth. Seventy-one (53.4%) died during the first five days of life, 27 (20.3%) died after the first five days of life, and 35 (26.3%) were eventually discharged from the unit. Neonatal infection was the key determinant of increased mortality after the first five days of life. In these patients, gram-positive organisms were recovered from 54% (14/26) of all body fluid cultures from 21 infected infants. Infections included Staphylococcus epidermidis (27% [7/26]), Staphylococcus aureus (15% [4/26]), and Escherichia coli (11% [3/26]). We propose that reducing the incidence of neonatal infections is necessary to substantially improve late NICU mortality in these very-low-birth-weight neonates.
TI  - [Choice of nutrient media for the laboratory diagnosis of Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The comparative study of a large assortment of liquid and solid culture media used for the cultivation of streptococci in laboratory practice in the USSR and abroad was carried out with the aim of selecting the optimal media for the laboratory diagnosis of group B. streptococci. Liquid media were tested with the use of 7 streptococcal reference strains, and some of these media, found to yield the best results, were selected for tests on clinical material. The use of liquid accumulation media was shown to permit the isolation of group B. streptococcal strains which could not be detected by the direct inoculation of clinical material into dishes with blood agar. The character of hemolysis induced by group B. streptococci in solid media with 5% of blood added was found to depend on the composition of the medium and the conditions of cultivation.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Veterans Administration Medical Center (1961-1981).
AB  - Laboratory data on blood cultures were reviewed for the period 1961-1981. Blood cultures accounted for 18% of all bacterial cultures. Nine percent of all blood cultures were positive for growth, including pathogens and contaminants. Of these, 21% wer contaiminants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant while Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently occurring pathogens, respectively. Four percent of all positive blood cultures, involving pathogens, had multiple organisms with E. coli the most common. There was no drastic change in the frequency of occurrence of Gram negative or positive isolates over the years, but certain pathogens like Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp. and Group A Streptococci were more common from 1971-81 than 1961-70. One percent of all patients with positive blood cultures had the same organism for two months or longer. Analysis of these longer occurring infections yielded a mean of 15, median of 7 and range of 2-87 months. E. coli was the most common pathogen in these chronic infections, followed by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.
TI  - Microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  - Primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. After sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. Furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 and Staphylococcus aureus SG 511. Microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. The following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with Candida albicans). 2. Cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. Only one semen sample was contaminated with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and Streptococcus nonhaemolyticus). Non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (Micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. Test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.
TI  - Comparative recovery of bacteria and yeasts from lysis-centrifugation and a conventional blood culture system.
AB  - Blood cultures obtained with a lysis-centrifugation (L-C) system and a conventional two-bottle broth system were compared for the recovery of bacteria and yeasts from 7,000 cultures. The L-C system recovered significantly more total organisms, Escherichia coli, and Candida spp. and detected more patients with bacteremia and fungemia due to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. The broth system recovered significantly more streptococci and detected significantly more low-level Pseudomonas bacteremias. Polymicrobic bacteremia and fungemia were detected equally well by either culture system. Aerobic organisms grew equally well on blood, chocolate, or brain heart infusion agar plates used for L-C inoculation. A total of 82% of colony counts measured no more than 10 CFU/ml of blood, and it was at these low levels that enhanced detection of organisms by either system was observed. The L-C system isolated organisms and detected yeasts more rapidly than did the broth system. Contaminants occurred in 8.2% of L-C cultures and 1.9% of broth cultures. Low colony counts on L-C plates occurred for both Staphylococcus epidermidis contamination and septicemia.
TI  - Surface thermodynamics of bacterial adhesion.
AB  - The adhesion of five strains of bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus (strain 049), Staphylococcus epidermidis (strain 047), Escherichia coli (strains 055 and 2627), and Listeria monocytogenes, to various polymeric surfaces was studied. The design of the experimental protocol was dictated by thermodynamic considerations. From the thermodynamic model for the adhesion of small particles from a suspension onto a solid substratum, it follows that the extent of adhesion is determined by the surface properties of all three phases involved, i.e., the surface tensions of the adhering particles, of the substrate, and of the suspending liquid medium. In essence, adhesion is more extensive to hydrophilic substrata (i.e., substrata of relatively high surface tension) than to hydrophobic substrata, when the surface tension of the bacteria is larger than that of the suspending medium. When the surface tension of the suspending liquid is larger than that of the bacteria, the opposite pattern of behavior prevails. Suspensions of bacteria at a concentration of 10(8) microorganisms per ml were brought into contact with several polymeric surfaces (Teflon, polyethylene, polystyrene, and acetal and sulfonated polystyrene) for 30 min at 20 degrees C. After rinsing, the number of bacteria adhering per unit surface area was determined by image analysis. The surface tension of the suspending medium. Hanks balanced salt solution, was modified through the addition of various amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide. It was found that the number of bacteria adhering per unit surface area correlates well with the thermodynamic predictions and that these data may be used to determine the surface tension of the different bacterial species. The surface tensions of the bacteria obtained in this fashion are in excellent agreement with those obtained by other methods.

AB  
TI  - Early results of a comparative trial of ceftazidime versus cephalothin, carbenicillin and gentamicin in the treatment of febrile granulocytopenic patients.
AB  - Ceftazidime was compared with a combination of cephalothin, carbenicillin and gentamicin as empirical therapy for fever in granulocytopenic patients. Forty-eight patients were studied in this randomized trial. In the 44 evaluable cases, favourable clinical responses were seen in 9/21 ceftazidime-treated cases and 13/23 patients treated with the combination. Four of 5 bacteraemias were cured with ceftazidime and 3 of 4 with triple therapy. Comparable numbers of patients developed new fevers while on therapy. Five ceftazidime-treated patients developed documented superinfection compared to 6 patients in the other group. Five patients treated with ceftazidime died from the initial infection or a superinfection compared with 3 on the combination. The overall results appear to be similar at this time. However, remarkable differences were observed between the types of superinfecting organisms with the two regimens. If all 48 patients are considered the isolates were as follows: ceftazidime treatment--5 clostridia, 3 enterococci, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis and 1 Citrobacter; cephalothin-carbenicillin-gentamicin treatment--4 Pseudomonas, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Bacteroides fragilis and 2 Candida spp. These results suggest that Gram-positive coverage should be added to ceftazidime in the empirical treatment of febrile granulocytopenic patients.
TI  - Peritoneal macrophages and opsonins: antibacterial defense in patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of phagocytic cells and opsonins in peritoneal dialysis effluents from 21 patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) was studied. Effluents contained an average of 12 x 10(6) cells per liter that were predominantly macrophages. Macrophages phagocytized and killed opsonized Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as efficiently as did polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from healthy donors. Macrophage chemiluminescence was one-third of that observed with donor PMNs. In the absence of opsonins, macrophages efficiently phagocytized and killed S. aureus by binding S. aureus cell wall protein A to macrophage surface IgG. Nine (43%) of 21 effluents failed to opsonize S. epidermidis, and none opsonized E. coli. When present, titers of S. epidermidis opsonins were 50- to 100-fold lower than that of normal serum. IgG and C3 concentrations in effluent reflected its opsonic capacity. Macrophages from patients undergoing CPD thus have intact phagocytic and bactericidal functions. However, the low level of opsonic molecules and inadequate numbers of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity may predispose patients undergoing CPD to peritonitis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It inhibited Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. It did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or Listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia spp., and Serratia spp. Cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. Cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. Cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Aerobic urethral flora of women with infertility and gynecologic problems.
AB  - One hundred eighty-five urine specimens were collected from an unselected group of non-gravid Nigerian women patients attending the infertility and gynaecologic clinics in Ile-Ife, Nigeria to investigate the aerobic urethral microflora. The specimens revealed that 25.9% of the total collected and processed contained bacteria flora. The most common aerobes isolated were Escherichia coli, P. mirabilis and S. epidermidis, in that order. The study has shown that there are changes in the urethral microflora from one physiologic age group to the other and that colonization of the urethral and urinogenital tract is important in the development of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Surface cultures and isolation procedures in infants born under unsterile conditions.
AB  - Umbilical and axillary skin cultures for bacteria and yeast were obtained within  two hours of birth from 108 term infants born vaginally under sterile (52) and nonsterile (56) conditions. The skin of infants born under nonsterile conditions was more frequently colonized (91%) than that of infants born under sterile conditions (66%). The most common skin flora of both groups was Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, and Escherichia coli. A significantly higher frequency of colonization with gram-positive cocci and diphtheroids was noted in infants born under nonsterile conditions. Cultures obtained on day 3 or 4 from infants born under sterile conditions revealed a higher frequency of colonization with E coli, enteric organisms, and potential pathogens than cultures obtained immediately after delivery. Cultures did not aid in clinical management, since in this sample no overt infection developed. Culture and isolation procedures in clinically well term infants born under nonsterile conditions are not warranted.
TI  - Bacteriologic contamination in an air-fluidized bed.
AB  - An air-fluidized bed was found to be a potential bacteriologic hazard when used by heavily infected burned patients. Even after following the manufacturer's protocol for eliminating bacteria from the bed and for cleaning the filter sheet, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens were recovered. Use of the bed was suspended until an effective disinfecting procedure was developed for the filter sheet and weekly removal of solid materials from the bed was instituted.
TI  - Treatment of serious infections with moxalactam.
AB  - In 93 hospitalized patients, 111 bacterial infections were treated with moxalactam. Eighty-three infections responded well to therapy, nine infections failed to respond to therapy or relapsed, and nine infections showed superinfection with resistant bacteria. The great majority of bacteria isolated had mean inhibitory concentrations below levels readily achieved in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, abscess fluid, and peritoneal fluid. Among the commonly identified bacteria, only Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had variable sensitivity to moxalactam.
TI  - Comparison of the B-D urine culture kit with a standard culture method and with the MS-2.
AB  - A total of 100 random clinical urine specimens were divided and used to compare Becton, Dickinson & Co. B-D Urine Culture Kit-treated urine (BDU) with refrigerated urine (RU). Each RU-BDU pair was cultured with the standard calibrated loop-plate method and also screened with the Abbott Laboratories MS-2 system at 0, 5, and 24 h. An additional 158 positive urine specimens containing greater than 10(5) CFU/ml were tested by standard culturing and MS-2 at 0 and 24 h. In addition, growth curves were run for Escherichia coli containing RU-BDU pairs at 0 and 24 h, and MS-2 detection time frequencies were analyzed. Culture results showed few changes in colony counts at 0 and 5 h for RU and BDU specimens. At 24 h, there were decreased colony counts for 7.0% of RU and 17.7% of BDU specimens. MS-2 results showed detection rates at 0 h of 100% for RU and 82.9% for BDU specimens and at 24 h of 91.1% for RU and 63.3% for BDU specimens. The organisms most frequently missed at 24 h were E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Growth curve analysis showed a 1-h delay of logarithmic growth in BDU specimens. MS-2 detection time analysis showed delayed positive reports owing to be extended detection time for BDU specimens. The B-D Urine Culture Kit is a convenient transport system; however, some difficulty in recovering organisms at 24 h with the standard culture method and increased difficulty with the MS-2 system were recognized.
TI  - [Intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  - Bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. The following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with diseases or died: Escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); Vibrio genitalis (3.86%); Streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); Staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); Proteus sp. (1.62%); Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); Pasteurella multocida (0.11%). The serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. Demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. The tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. There were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The relationship of disc position to zone-of-inhibition size in the disc-agar diffusion test.
AB  - One hundred sixteen clinical isolates of Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were tested against cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefamandole and piperacillin by disc-agar diffusion. Zones-of-inhibition of discs dropped near the center of the plate were compared with those dropped near the periphery. In 28% of the comparisons the inner and outer zones differed by 2 mm or more. Of those, the inner zone was larger 2.5 times more often than the outer zone. Results suggest that the chances of obtaining a susceptible result are greater when discs are placed near the center as opposed to the periphery of the plate.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - [Clinical, cytological and microbiological studies of the MMA syndrome].
AB  - Clinical, cytological, and microbiological investigations were carried out of a total of 793 sows in the course of 10 days after farrowing. It was found that the MMA syndrome was manifested in the first days following farrowing with higher temperature, changes in the genital organs with a purulent discharge from the first to the third day, and lesions in the mammary gland with inflammatory processes or decrease in the milk secretion. The cell content of milk of the diseased sows was higher. The microbiologic study of uterine, vaginal, and milk secretion led to the isolation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis as well as mixed infections and other bacteria as causative agents of MMA.
TI  - [Polymicrobial endocarditis. Report of a case and review of the literature].
AB  - We describe a case of polimicrobial endocarditis in a patient with congenital aortic stenosis and end-stage renal failure in treatment with steroids and chronic haemodialisis. The blood culture grew e.coli, enterobacter sp, and s.epidermidis. Only a few papers in the literature have been devoted to this entity. Its frequency seems to be progressively higher. The present case is a good example to talk about the predisponent factors. The review of literature has shown that the occurrence of this entity is specially high among addicts, the most frequent bacteria are s.aureus, streptococci and pseudomonas and the mortality can be as high as 80%.
TI  - Synergism of the antimicrobial agents miconazole, bacitracin and polymyxin B.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a combination of miconazole with bacitracin against Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus, was greater than the sum of the effects observed with the two drugs independently. Since no uptake changes were observed, this synergism may originate from a combined effect of miconazole and bacitracin on the biosynthesis of the carrier lipid, undecaprenyl-phosphate, resulting in an impairment of cell wall integrity. The synergism between these drugs and polymyxin B may be due to an increased accessibility of the cell membrane to polymyxin B. Miconazole and bacitracin, alone or in combination, are completely inactive against Escherichia coli. Since polymyxin B disturbs the permeability barrier and stimulates the uptake of miconazole, the synergism of polymyxin B, miconazole and bacitracin may originate from the ability of miconazole and bacitracin to penetrate the bacterial membranes in the presence of polymyxin B.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Candida yeasts. Partial purification and characterization of the active substance of Candida guilliermondii.
AB  - The activity spectra of 25 Candida strains on strains of different species of bacteria were recorded. The active substance produced by Candida guilliermondii strain 848 was partially purified by cation exchange and chromatography gel filtration on Sephadex G-15. The substance is heat stable (80 degrees C, 10 min), not susceptible to treatment with proteases and most probably of a molecular weight smaller than 3500 Dalton. At a concentration of 50 A.U./ml it acts bacteriostatically on a Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (Fig. 1).
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - Broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  - In 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, Silastic Broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. The catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. There were 14 episodes of Broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. Cultures of blood drawn from Broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. The most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. The species causing the infections were Enterobacter cloacae (three cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), Staphylococcus aureus (three cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), Escherichia coli (two cases), Pseudomonas dentrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis. Antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.
TI  - Comparative synergistic activity of netilmicin-piperacillin versus gentamicin-piperacillin.
AB  - The synergistic action of the combination netilmicin-piperacillin in comparison to gentamicin-piperacillin was studied in 206 clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by means of the checkerboard technique. Overall, netilmicin-piperacillin acted synergistically against 31% and gentamicin-piperacillin against 14% of the 206 strains. In particular, synergism was more frequently observed with netilmicin-piperacillin against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synergy was uncommon with either combination against enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Serratia spp. Only partial synergy or indifference was seen with both combinations against Klebsiella spp. The interaction of netilmicin would appear to be superior to that of gentamicin in combination with piperacillin.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Effects of oral antibiotics on stool flora and overall sensitivity patterns in an intensive care nursery.
AB  - The effects of orally administered gentamicin and colistin on stool bacterial flora and overall antibiotic sensitivity patterns were evaluated in 100 newborns at risk for neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis. Gentamicin (2.5 mg/kg q6h) and colistin (1 mg/kg q6h) were administered to randomly selected groups of 50 newborns for 3 wk after birth during an 11-month study period. Stools were collected on days 1, 11, and 21 and cultures were grown under aerobic conditions on three different media. Staph. epidermidis was the most common predominant organism in both antibiotic groups, whereas E. coli and Klebsiella were the most common Gram-negative bacteria isolated. Seventeen % of these Gram-negative species were resistant to colistin and 9% to gentamicin, with a gradual increase occurring during the 3-wk period. On the basis of 980 positive cultures from all sites in babies in the nursery during the 11-month study, E. coli sensitivity to kanamycin and gentamicin ranged between 92% and 100% except for one month midway through the study when sensitivity to kanamycin was at 80% and then returned to the 92-100% range. Klebsiella sensitivity to both aminoglycosides remained greater than 95% throughout. The incidence of neonatal sepsis remained consistent at seven to nine per 1000 live births during the study. One baby of 50 in the gentamicin group developed necrotizing enterocolitis at 5 wk of age; 0/50 in the colistin group had necrotizing enterocolitis (not significant).
TI  - [Study of the spermatic bacterial flora in infertile males (author's transl)].
AB  - Two groups of infertile males (65 and 132 patients) have been investigated in two different laboratories, with two different methods to obtain semen. The bacteriological results are quite similar in the two groups. The microorganisms which have been isolated are : beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus, Epidermidis staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Corynebacter, Viridans streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Neisseria, Escherichia coli, anaerobic Staphylococcus, anaerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Corynebacter type IV. Fungus, Achromobacter, 20 p. cent of the patients are chronically infected without any clinical signs. This infection is probably of prostatic origin with an important number of bacteria in the semen (more than 3 000/ml). No relation has been shown between the bacteriological data and the physical and cytological characteristics of the sperm, except the pH : semens with a low pH are generally azoospermic and highly contaminated.
TI  - Killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes: role of an O2-independent bactericidal system.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that a cationic bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) present in both rabbit and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the principal O2-independent bactericidal agent of these cells toward several strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (1978. J. Biol. Chem. 253: 2664--2672; 1979. J. Biol. Chem. 254: 11000--11009). To further evaluate the possible role of this protein in the killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we have measured the bactericidal activity of intact rabbit peritoneal exudate leukocytes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and of intact human leukocytes from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. Anaerobic conditions were created by flushing the cells under a nitrogen stream. Effective removal of oxygen was demonstrated by the inability of nitrogen-flushed leukocytes to mount a respiratory burst (measured as increased conversion of 1-[14C]glucose leads to 14CO2 or by superoxide production) during bacterial ingestion. At a bacteria/leukocyte ratio of 10:1, killing of gram-positive, BPI-resistant, Staphylococcus epidermidis is markedly impaired in the absence of oxygen (76.4 +/- 3.3% killing in room air, 29.2 +/- 8.2% killing in nitrogen). Essentially all increased bacterial survival is intracellular. In contrast, both a nonopsonized rough strain (MR-10) and an opsonized smooth strain (MS) of S. typhimurium 395 are killed equally well in room air and nitrogen. A maximum of 70--80 MR-10 and 30--40 MS are killed per leukocyte either in the presence or absence of oxygen. There is no intracellular bacterial survival in either condition indicating that intracellular O2-independent bactericidal system(s) of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes can at least match the leukocyte's ingestive capacity. Whole homogenates and crude acid extracts manifest similar bactericidal capacity toward S. typhimurium 395. This activity can be accounted for by the BPI content of these cell fractions and is virtually eliminated by immune (anti-BPI), but not by preimmune goat IgG-rich fractions. Opsonization of smooth MS, required for bacterial killing by intact leukocytes, does not alter bacterial sensitivity to BPI in crude or purified form. Leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease killed ingested S. typhimurium 396 MS nearly as well as did normal leukocytes. The bactericidal activity toward E. coli (J5) of crude acid extracts of the CGD and normal human leukocytes was virtually the same and was nearly completely inhibited by anti-BPI IgG-rich fractions, but not by preimmune IgG-rich fractions. These findings suggest that the killing of gram-negative bacteria such as S. typhimurium by intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes may also be attributed to the action of BPI.
TI  - Routine subcultures shown to be unnecessary in radiometric detection of bacteremia using three media.
AB  - A study to determine the necessity of routine blind subcultures when using the radiometric BACTEC-460 instrument for detection of bacteremia was conducted. In the first phase, blind subcultures were performed on day 10 of incubation; in the second phase, blind subcultures were performed on day 4; in the final phase the subculture was performed on day one. During the study, 6,208 blood cultures from 2,455 patients were inoculated into three different culture media. There were 454 microbial isolates recovered, including 269 presumed pathogenic isolates. The single significant discrepancy between blind subculture and radiometric detection was a case of Staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia in which the organism was detected 48 hours earlier by blind subculture. There were no cultures in which significant bacterial isolates were detected by blind subcultures but not radiometrically. Thus, under the conditions of this study, routine blind subcultures are not necessary when using the BACTEC radiometric system for detection of bacteremia.
TI  - Long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - Thirteen women and two preadolescent girls who suffered recurrences after six months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim (TMP; 40 mg) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ; 200 mg) taken thrice weekly at bedtime were enrolled in a 24-month study of prophylaxis with the same region. During 29.1 cumulative patient-years of prophylaxis, two infections due to Escherichia coli and one each due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis occurred (0.14 infection/patient-year). MICs for these isolates were less than or equal to 2 micrograms of TMP/ml and greater than 512 micrograms of SMZ/ml. During prophylaxis, 106 of 116 cultures from the periurethral area and 66 of 97 cultures from the anal and canal yielded no aerobic gram-negative bacilli. In three patients, the periurethral area was colonized with aerobic gram-negative bacilli with MICs of greater than or equal to 2 micrograms of TMP/ml. Thirteen patients were followed after the discontinuation of prophylaxis. Eight suffered recurrences, seven with organisms susceptible to TMP. After one year the remaining five had experienced no recurrences. It is concluded that long-term prophylaxis with 40 mg of TMP and 200 mg of SMZ thrice weekly is an effective, well-tolerated regimen that can maintain an infection-free state in women with histories of frequent urinary reinfections.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Role of lymphatic vessels in bacterial clearance from early soft-tissue infection.
AB  - A popular concept regarding the pathophysiologic characteristics of infection is  that early bacterial clearance from tissue is an important host defense mechanism. Staphylococcus aureus, S epidermidis, Escherichia coli, enterococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were radiolabeled with tritiated thymidine and injected subcutaneously into rabbit ears. Negligible clearance occurred at five hours, and less than 30% of injected bacteria cleared in 24 hours. Lymphatic function measured by clearance with bovine serum albumin labeled with iodine 125 was normal at all times during the first 24 hours. Clearance of live S aureus, radiolabeled by tritiated thymidine, was not accelerated by preexisting 12- or 24-hour hold-old inflammatory lesions. Clearance of bacteria rendered nonviable in vitro by antibiotics and heat were cleared in proportion to the degree of bacterial cell lysis. Bacterial clearance of S aureus correlated with the rate of bacterial lysis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that lymphatic clearance of bacteria from soft tissues is of negligible importance as a host defense mechanism in the decisive period of soft-tissue infection.
TI  - [Study of the spermatic bacterial flora in infertile males (author's transl)].
AB  - Two groups of infertile males (65 and 132 patients) have been investigated in two different laboratories, with two different methods to obtain semen. The bacteriological results are quite similar in the two groups. The microorganisms which have been isolated are : beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus, Epidermidis staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Corynebacter, Viridans streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Neisseria, Escherichia coli, anaerobic Staphylococcus, anaerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Corynebacter type IV, Fungus, Achromobacter. 20 p. cent of the patients are chronically infected without any clinical signs.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of commercial U.S.P. formulated insulin.
AB  - This study examined the suitability of commercial U.S.P. insulin as a bacterial growth medium. Purified port insulin (Iletin II, Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Indiana) was inoculated with approximately 500,000 bacteria per ml of: (1) Staphylococcus epidermidis, (2) Staphylococcus aureus, or (3) Escherichia coli. All three bacterial cultures were sterilized by the insulin within 24 h at 37 degrees C. However, Staph epidermidis was the most sensitive and Escherichia coli was least sensitive to the bactericidal effects of commercial U.S.P. insulin. Components of commercial U.S.P. insulin were then examined for their bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli. Phenol (230 mg/dl), glycerol (1.6 d/dl), and zinc cations (4.0, 2.0, and 1.0 mg/dl) demonstrated bactericidal activity, whereas dialyzed insulin demonstrated minimal effects. We conclude that insulin contaminated with 5 X 10(5) bacteria commonly found on the skin will self-sterilize within 24 h. This effect is secondary to the additives placed in the insulin and not to the insulin itself.
TI  - Vaginal organisms in prepubertal children with and without vulvovaginitis. A vaginoscopic study.
AB  - In a prospective clinical and microbiological study covering 67 prepubertal children the vaginal flora of 31 asymptomatic children was compared to 36 children suffering from abnormal vaginal discharge and/or vulvovaginitis. Vaginoscopy was employed to obtain bacteriological specimens without contamination. Swabs were inoculated into prereduced transportmedia (PORT A CUL, BBL) and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. The most prevalent aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis. Enterococci and Escherichia coli; the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella parvula, Eubacteria, Propionibacterium and Bacteroides species. A similar microbiological pattern was found in both groups, although anaerobes, like Peptococci and Peptostreptococci and Bacteroides species, as well as yeasts, like Candida albicans were significantly more frequent in the group with signs and symptoms. Lactobacilli were less common in this group.
TI  - [Anaerobic microflora of praepubertal children (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriologic cultures of the vagina and the cervix of 38 praepubertal children,  aged 3 months to 16 years (average age 9 years) from the outpatient department for infants and juveniles of the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Vienna were obtained vaginascopically using anaerobic transportmedia (Port a Cul) and were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. An average of 5.3 species was also isolated per child (2.9 aerobic and 2.5 anaerobic species). The commonest anaerobes were Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bact. melaninogenicus, Proprionibacterium and Veillonella parvula, the prevalent aerobes, were Enterococci, E coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that anaerobic bacteria amount a significant component of the flora of the lower genital-tract of healthy children, as well as of infants with vaginal discharge.
TI  - Intravascular coagulation in mice by the compact-colony-forming active substance  (CCFAS) extracted from a strain of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The compact-colony-forming active substance (CCFAS) extracted from a Staphylococcus aureus strain was capable of killing mice only when Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis or Escherichia coli was injected i.v. before the injection of CCFAS. In the mice killed 30 min after treatment with heat-killed Staph. aureus and CCFAS, remarkable congestion of the lung and thrombus-like lesions in the kidney were observed. In the mice killed 6 h after injection with CCFAS and living Staph. aureus congestion and inflammatory-cell filtration were found in the liver, especially within the Glisson's capsule. However, when mice were killed 30 days after treatment with CCFAS and Staph. aureus, fibrin and hyalin thrombi were observed most frequently in the renal glomeruli but also in the liver and lung.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on ceftizoxime in otorhinolaryngological field (author's transl)].
AB  - From the laboratory and clinical studies on ceftizoxime (CZX), the following results were obtained 1) CZX was compared with cefazolin (CEZ) for in vitro activity against 6 standard strains and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (19 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14), Proteus sp. (17), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella sp. (3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13). While somewhat less active against Gram-positive cocci than CEZ, CZX was far more active than CEZ against Gram-negative bacilli. 2) The time course of mean serum CZX levels in 2 patients given a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg was as follows: 24.9 microgram/ml at 15 minutes, 18.5 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 13.2 microgram/ml at 1 hour, 6.4 microgram/ml at 2 hours and 2.7 microgram/ml at 4 hours. The mean serum half life was 1.36 hours. The mean tonsil concentrations of CZX 30 minutes after a single intravenous dose of 0.5 g and 1.0 g were 5.9 microgram/g and 9.6 microgram/g. respectively, with the ratio to the serum concentration of 0.33 and 0.32. 3) CZX was given to 28 patients with ear, nose, and throat infections, and overall rate of effectiveness was 92.3%. No clinical side effects were observed. Changes in laboratory test findings included slightly elevated GOT and/or GPT in 3 cases.
TI  - Multiple-organism bacteremia in the surgical intensive care unit: a sign of intraperitoneal sepsis.
AB  - Multiple-organism bacteremia (MOB), as defined by the growth of two or more organisms in the same blood culture, was studied in the surgical intensive care unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Over the 2 years encompassing 1977 and 1978, there were 125 bacteremic episodes in 83 patients; of this total, 32 episodes of MOB were present in 27 patients. The mortality rate associated with MOB was 48% compared to 25% in those patients with a single organism in their blood (P less than 0.025). Three patients had two episodes of MOB, and one had three episodes; all died. The etiology in two patients was, surprisingly, intravascular devices. Two patients with four episodes of MOB had severe burns, whereas aspiration pneumonia and an infected amputation stump accounted for two more episodes. In the remaining 21 patients (78%) with 24 episodes of MOB (75%), all had intraperitoneal pathologic findings. Of these cases, 19 (59%) episodes were clearly related to intraperitoneal sepsis. The remaining five appeared related to intraperitoneal causes but were without confirmation. There was no difference in the incidence of Bacteroides and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The incidences of enterococci and Escherichia coli were significantly higher (P less than 0.005 for both) and dominant in multiple- versus single-organism bacteremia. Multiple-organism bacteremia is associated with an increased mortality rate, with origins characteristic of polymicrobial infections. The most important source is intraperitoneal and the occurrence of MOB should alert the surgeon to the likelihood of intraperitoneal sepsis.
TI  - Human fibronectin binding to staphylococcal surface protein and its relative inefficiency in promoting phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages.
AB  - The interaction between human fibronectin and 17 strains of staphylococci was studied in an attempt to elucidate the staphylococcal cell wall component(s) involved in fibronectin binding and to determine the influence of fibronectin upon phagocytosis by three types of phagocytic cells. Purified, radiolabeled fibronectin bound to a similar degree to six laboratory strains and three fresh clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus; similar binding of fibronectin was found with S. aureus strains deficient in cell wall teichoic acid or clumping factor and coagulase, as well as with three strains of S. epidermidis. There was minimal binding of fibronectin to encapsulated S. aureus and to Escherichia coli. Fibronectin bound to intact cells and to a crude cell wall preparation of S. aureus H, but not to purified cell walls or peptidoglycan. Trypsinization of staphylococci prevented subsequent fibronectin binding, but binding did not correlate well with the protein A content in S. aureus cell walls. At physiological concentrations, fibronectin binding to staphylococci did not promote phagocytosis of bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, or alveolar macrophages. Also, depletion of fibronectin from normal human serum did not result in a measurable loss of opsonic activity for staphylococci. It is concluded that fibronectin binding to staphylococci involves a surface protein shared among strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, and that in comparison to C3b and IgG, fibronectin plays a relatively minor role as an opsonin for staphylococci.
TI  - Increased serum antibacterial activity after turpentine-induced acute inflammation.
AB  - An acute inflammatory response was induced in rabbits by an intramuscular injection of turpentine. After this injection serial serum samples were obtained and serum haptoglobin levels were monitored. In addition, increased antibacterial activity was measured using a viable plate and photometric growth assay. As early as 4 hrs after turpentine challenge an increase was noted in serum antibacterial activity towards Staphylococcus aureus. At 48 hrs pronounced killing activity was demonstrated against S. aureus and S. epidermidis but not against Escherichia coli or other gram negative bacilli. By five days another serum bactericidal activity was present against Bacillus subtilis. Enhanced serum antibacterial activity persisted for 2 weeks. Partial characterization of these factors indicates that they are probably beta lysins.
TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.
TI  - Bacteriologic study of sow agalactia.
AB  - Necropsy of 13 agalactic and 11 normally lactating sows at 1 to 2 days after parturition revealed that 7 of the agalactic and 4 of the clinically normal sows had lesions of mastitis. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus equisimilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant organisms isolated. The organisms were isolated as pure and as mixed cultures and all 3 were isolated from normal appearing, as well as mastitic, glands. Pure culture isolation of E. coli (44 gland segments) was significantly associated with microscopic lesions of mastitis, regardless of the number of colonies isolated, whereas pure culture isolation of Streptococcus equisimilis or S epidermidis in low to moderate numbers was not. Isolation of large numbers of beta-hemolytic streptococci (2 gland segments) or of S epidermidis (6 gland segments) was associated with microscopic evidence of mastitis. Cultural examination of uterus and cervix revealed 5 isolates of strict anaerobic bacteria, all different species, from 4 of the 24 sows. Culture of 2 mammary glands from each sow revealed no strict anaerobes. Phase-contrast microscopic examination of specimens from mammary glands, uterus, and cervix of each sow revealed no spirochetes. Attempts to isolate mycoplasmas and chlamydiae from mammary gland, uterine tube (fallopian tube), uterus, cervix, and urethra of the 24 sows were negative. The evidence confirms previous reports that coliforms are the most significant bacteria in mastitis of the sow.
TI  - Interaction of initiator Met-tRNArMet (Escherichia coli) and Gly-tRNAIGly (Staphylococcus epidermidis) with bacterial elongation factor Tu:GTP complex.
AB  - Jekowsky et al. reported recently that elongation factor Tu:GTP complex from Escherichia coli protected aminoacyl-tRNA from digestion by pancreatic RNase (I). On the basis of their finding, we have developed the "RNase-resistance assay" for determination of the dissociation constant of aminoacyl-tRNA from aminoacyl-tRNA:EF-Tu:GTP complex. By the use of this sensitive assay, the dissociation constants were estimated to be 3.6 x 10(-7) M for Ala-tRNA1Ala (Torulopsis utilis), 7.9 x 10(-8) M for Phe-tRNAPhe (Escherichia coli), 8.1 x 10(-7) M for initiator Met-tRNAfMet (Escherichia coli), and 5.4 x 10(-6) M for Gly-tRNA1Gly (Staphylococcus epidermidis) participating in cell wall biosynthesis. Moreover, using a relatively large amount of EF-Tu:GTP, we have been able to detect the ternary complexes of initiator Met-tRNAfMet and Gly-tRNA1Gly with EF-Tu:GTP even by the method of gel filtration.
TI  - Survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  - Thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees C using 10% glycerol as the protective medium. Cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. Enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group B, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and P. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. Practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.
TI  - [Epidemiology of nosocomial septicemia (author's transl)].
AB  - During recent decades the incidence of nosocomial septicemia has considerably increased. From 1976--1980 on average 0.6% of 39, 802 prospectively analyzed hospital patients acquired septicemia. The risk of acquiring nosocomial septicemia in intensive care units is 10 times higher than in general wards. The risk is highest in medical and surgical intensive care units. Most common bacteria causing nosocomial septicemia were: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nosocomial pneumonia, wound infections and venous catheter infections most often lead to septicemia. In half the patients with septicemia the infection either directly caused death or contributed to the death of the patient. The hospital costs for patients with septicemia are twice as high as for patients with the same underlying disease without septicemia.
TI  - Premature labor. II. Bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  - Human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase A2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. The striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase A2 activity. Activity was found in Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus A and B, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pneumococcus, Lactobacillus, and Mycoplasma hominis. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and S viridans had the highest activities. The specific activities of phospholipase A2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase A2 of the amnion and chorion. We postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase A2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus saprophyticus biotype 3.
AB  - Staphylococcus saprophyticus biotype 3 (Micrococcus subgroup 3 or M3) has usually been shown to be the second commonset cause of urinary tract infections in European women who are not in hospital. It generally causes pyuria and symptoms as severe as those caused by Escherichia coli. Unlike S. epidermidis it is seldom found as a contaminant in midstream urine specimens, and almost exclusively infects women in their reproductive years. However, S. saprophyticus is seldom differentiated from S. epidermidis in Canadian clinical laboratories. Urinary isolates of S. saprophyticus were presumptively differentiated from other coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae by their resistance to novobiocin as demonstrated by a simple disc susceptibility test that misidentified the infecting organism in only 3.4% of specimens. These novobiocin-resistant, coagulase-negative organisms caused similar proportions of the urinary tract infections in young women in York, England and Vancouver -- 6.6% and 6.9% respectively. In York these organisms were associated with significantly greater pyuria than novobiocin-sensitive organisms or bile-tolerant streptococci but not S. aureus or Enterobacteriaceae. In both communities novobiocin-sensitive, coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae were appreciably more resistant to penicillin than novobiocin-resistant organisms. Thus, differentiating S. saprophyticus from novobiocin-sensitive, coagulase-negative organisms provides information that is clinically useful, particularly for primary care practitioners working in the community or in outpatient clinics.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin against 7,312  clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin was tested against 7,312  clinical isolates of aerobic pathogens. Cefoxitin was found to have a broad spectrum of activity. Among the gram-positive cocci, 99.1% of Staphylococcus aureus, 94.4% of Staphylococcus epidermidis and 98.1% of streptococci group B had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 microgram/ml or less, while only 4.6% of enterococci were sensitive to this concentration of cefoxitin. Among the gram-negative rods 94.4% of Escherichia coli, 89.3% of Klebsiella spp., 97.3% of Proteus mirabilis, 97.4% of Proteus vulgaris and 79.3% of Proteus morganii were sensitive to 16 microgram/ml of cefoxitin or less. The effect of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was negligible. Cefoxitin was less active than cephalothin against gram-positive cocci, the difference being most pronounced against enterococci. Cephalothin was also found to be more active than cefoxitin against P. mirabilis, while cefoxitin was superior to cephalothin against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., P. vulgaris and P. morganii.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - Observations on the growth of urethral and vaginal bacteria in sterile urine.
AB  - Voided, midstream urine specimens from 127 patients and volunteers with sterile bladder urine were incubated for 24 hours to measure the presence or absence of inhibitory activity in urine to small numbers (100 or less bacteria per milliliter) of contaminating Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella), enterococci and several species of the normal perineal flora. Virtually no inhibitory activity was found for Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis when measured by substantial growth at 24 hours. Of the 32 patients with 100 or less Enterobacteriaceae per milliliter urine before incubation, 30 urine specimens had growth of 10(5) bacteria per milliliter or more of the same organism; 9 of 30 specimens began growth at less than 10 Enterobacteriaceae per milliliter urine. The 39 urine specimens containing 10(4) or more enterococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis after 24 hours of incubation began with original inocula of 100 bacteria per milliliter or less; 28 of 39 began growth at less than 10 bacteria per milliliter. Growth rates of pure strains inoculated into sterile, filtered urine (strains derived from from the same individual as the urine in which they were inoculated) showed significant differences in bacterial growth at 4 to 6 hours after incuation; Escherichia coli and enterococci generated 10 to 100 times more colonies than strains from the normal perineal flora (lactobacilli, corynebacteria and so forth). We conclude that normal urine is non-inhibitory to small inocula of Enterobacteriacea and enterococci but that it is not as conducive to growth for some of the indigent, resident flora, perhaps explaining the relative infrequency of urinary infections owing to normal, perineal bacteria.
TI  - Evidence of cytocidal effects of Pasteurella haemolytica on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Pasteurella haemolytica had a pronounced cytocidal effect on bovine mononuclear leukocytes. Mononuclear leukocytes separated from venous blood on Ficoll-diatrizoate and incubated with either P haemolytica or Escherichia coli showed a significantly greater percentage cell death than did cells incubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis or controls. Neither heat-killed nor x-irradiated P haemolytica caused a significant percentage cell death. The cytotoxic potential of P haemolytica was dose related in that cell death among mononuclear leukocytes increased as the ratio of bacteria-to-cells increased. Enriched monocyte cultures showed a higher and less variable rate of cell death than either enriched lymphocyte or mixed leukocyte cultures.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative methods of studying the effect of lipids on bacteria grown on the surface of solid culture media.
AB  - New qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. The methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. Oleic and linoleic acids inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes markedly, Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition of growth of a strain of Str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. Linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. The methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Quantitative culture of intravenous catheters and other intravascular inserts.
AB  - Quantitative cultures were done on 149 intravenous catheters and 40 additional intravascular inserts. Intradermal and intravascular segments of the insert were cultured separately. The inserts were immersed in broth and flushed. The number of colony-forming units (cfu) per insert was estimated by surface culture of serial dilution of the broth. Nonquantitative culture of undiluted broth was also done. Since all inserts associated with bacteremia had at least 10(3) cfu, inserts greater than 10(3) cfu were considered infected. Staphylococcus epidermidis was more likely than more virulent organisms to colonize an insert without causing bacteremia. The inserts in one bacteremic patient were infected from a distant bloodstream focus; however, in the majority of patients, quantitative intradermal cultures suggested that the insertion site was the portal of entry. In bacteremic patients, either a positive quantitative or a nonquantitative culture identified an infected insert. However, only 33% of positive nonquantitative insert cultures from nonbacteremic patients were confirmed by quantitative insert culture.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefamandole in the field of obstetrics and gynecology (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefamandole, a new antibiotic with various characteristics was applied clinically in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, and following results were obtained. Cefamandole was administered to 8 cases with cystitis, 2 cases with pelvic infection. The organisms isolated were 5 cases of Escherichia coli, 4 cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one case of Klebsiella. Bacteria disappeared in all cases after 5-day treatment with cefamandole. No side effects of the drug were noticed throughout all cases. From the above mentioned clinical experience, cefamandole is considered to be a useful drug for clinical application.
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance in Finland after five years' use of plain trimethoprim.
AB  - A total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. Samples were obtained in Turku, Finland, where use of the drug is much greater than in other parts of Finland. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. Escherichia coli and Micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. Similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. These findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Response of Escherichia coli to Beta-lactam antibiotics: effect of the concomitant presence of staphylococci exhibiting inducible Beta-lactamase activity.
AB  - The response to Beta-lactam antibiotics of mixed cultures of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in static culture and in an in vitro model which simulates the dynamic conditions in which bacteria are exposed to antibiotics in the treatment of urinary infection. In static cultures, the concomitant presence of staphylococci exhibiting inducible Beta-lactamase activity substantially reduced the efficacy of benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (but not cefuroxime) against E. coli. In the conditions of the bladder model some interference with the activity of Beta-lactam antibiotics by Beta-lactamase producing staphylococci was also demonstrated. Nevertheless, relatively modest doses of ampicillin were still able to suppress growth of susceptible E. coli for periods exceeding the normal interdose interval, even in the presence of enzyme-producing staphylococci.
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - Comparison of direct and standard antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from blood.
AB  - To determine the reliability of early antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we compared the results of direct and standard single-disk diffusion methods for 581 positive blood cultures processed routinely by the clinical microbiology laboratory. The direct procedure differed from the standard one only in that the 0.5 McFarland inoculum was prepared from 1 ml of turbid broth rather than five isolated colonies from a subculture plate. A major discrepancy in results was defined as a change from susceptible to resistant or vice versa according to interpretive standards for zone diameters, whereas a minor discrepancy was defined as a shift to or from the intermediate category when paired direct and standard tests were compared. The overall agreement between the two methods was 94.6% of 2,308 comparisons. There were 119 minor (5.2%) and 6 major (0.3%) discrepancies. The major discrepancies were seen with three strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one strain each of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter sp. Direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures that were pure by gram-stained smear provided reliable results 24 to 36 h earlier than conventional procedures; therefore, we recommended this procedure to guide early antimicrobial therapy in patients with bacterial sepsis.
TI  - The infected pacemaker pocket.
AB  - Between January, 1963, and September, 1978, a total of 1,789 pacemakers were implanted at Henry Ford Hospital. Infection at the site of implantation developed in 19 instances for an incidence of 1.06 percent. The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis, and conservative treatment was successful with these patients. In all patients with organisms other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, reimplantation of a new unit in a new, clean site was required.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Requirement of extracellular complement and immunoglobulin for intracellular killing of micro-organisms by human monocytes.
AB  - The role of serum factors in the intracellular killing of bacteria by monocytes was studied on the basis of an assay independent of phagocytosis. After 3 min of phagocytosis of preopsonized bacteria and removal of noningested bacteria, the monocytes containing bacteria are reincubated for various periods and the number of unkilled bacteria is determined by a microbiological method after lysis of the cells. Evidence that this assay measures the killing of ingested bacteria was provided by scanning electron microscopy, lysostaphin treatment, and the effect on the rate of intracellular killing of inactivated serum lacking specific opsonic activity. Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureaus, S. epidermidis, and Escherichia coli by human monocytes does not occur or is low in the absence of serum, and maximal killing is only reached when fresh serum is present; intermediate values are obtained in the presence of heat-inactivated serum. These findings indicate that complement stimulates intracellular killing. Isolated heterogeneous immunoglobulin (Ig)G, pFc fragments of heterogeneous IgG, and both IgG1 and IgG3 stimulate intracellular killing of S. aureaus by monocytes to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum. Sphingomyelinase, which decreases the number of Fc receptors, and neuraminidase, which increases these receptors, respectively, decreased and increased the intracellular killing, whereas anti-monocyte serum completely abolished the stimulation of intracellular killing by inactivated serum. These results prove that interaction of the Fc receptor with the Fc part of IgG is required for the intracellular killing. Inhibition of the activation of complement components via the alternative pathway gave a considerable reduction in the intracellular killing of S. aureaus; impairment of the activation via the classical pathway had no effect. The addition of complement components to heat-inactivated serum showed that intracellular killing is maximal only when C3b is generated. Reduction of the number of C3b receptors in the membrane by trypsin or pronase decreased intracellular killing in the presence of fresh serum; anti-monocyte serum completely abolished the stimulation of intracellular killing by fresh serum. These results lead to the conclusion that intracellular killing is also dependent on the interaction between C3b and its receptor in the membrane.
TI  - Attachment of bacteria to exfoliated cells from the urogenital tract.
AB  - To establish urogenital infections, organisms must adhere to the mucosal lining.  A differential adherence capacity among various bacterial species was observed when exfoliated urethral and urothelial cells were tested in an in vitro system. No difference in the adherence capacity of a particular species was observed when tested with exfoliated cells obtained from voided urine from different healthy individuals of the same sex. Escherichia coli harvested directly from urine specimens of patients with significant bacteriuria showed a significantly higher capacity to adhere than when obtained from the primary isolation plate. Staphylococcus saprophyticus adhered significantly better to urothelial cells than did Staphylococcus epidermidis. Adherence did not differ when the tests were performed in ultrafiltrated, infected and noninfected urine. Variations of the osmolality did not influence the adherence rate of E. coli. Gonococci showed an increased capacity to adhere when tested in urine of increasing acidity. Gonococci producing T1 colonies adhered by significantly higher numbers per cell than such bacteria producing T4 colonies.
TI  - [Microfloral study of bull seminal fluid stored at low temperatures].
AB  - Hundred twenty three samples of bull semen fluid frozen at 196 degrees C including 83 plastic ampules, 20 granules and 20 plastic straws obtained from the containers of the insemination stations of 10 farms from the Sofia district were investigated. Two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: Escherichia coli--25 strains, Hafnia--16 strains, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. The remaining Gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. Gram positive bacteria: Micrococcus--19 strains, Staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, Staph. epidermidis--15 strains, Bacillus cereus--15 strains, B. subtilis--12 strains. Other representatives of Gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. Least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. It was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. The conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. It is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.
TI  - [Basic and clinical examinations of CS-1170 in pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. CS-1170 was administered for the purpose of prophylaxis during cardiac catheterization in patients with heart disease, and its blood levels were measured. 2. The mean blood level (Moni-Trol I standard) after one intravenous shot of 20 mg/kg was 53.6 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged below 6 and 66.9 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged above 10 at 30 minutes, and 1.95 mcg/ml and 5.2 mcg/ml respectively at 6 hours. 3. The mean half life of the blood level was 1.09 hours in catheterized children aged below 6, 1.37 hours in catheterized children aged above 10, and 0.71 hours in infections children. 4. The urinary excretion seemed satisfactorily high although there was a great variation. 5. The clinical efficacy was 88.9%. 6. The bacteriological efficacy was 100% for E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus and was 0% for Staphylococcus epidermidis. 7. Although GOT and GPT were elevated in one case as a side effect, they rapidly returned to normal after discontinuation of administration.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Effects of intestinal micro-organisms on fluid and electrolyte transport in the jejunum of the rat.
AB  - Culture filtrates of micro-organisms isolated from the upper intestinal secretions of malnourished children and grown in pure culture were shown to impair the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes in live rats. Decreased net movement out of the intestinal lumen, or actual secretion of water, sodium or potassium into the intestinal lumen, was found with culture filtrates of single isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli 055, Escherichia coli B7A, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. These organisms have been found to contaminate upper intestinal secretions in malnourished children and it is suggested that the effects observed in these experiments might be relevant to the production of the diarrhoea that is a dominant clinical feature of childhood malnutrition.
TI  - Absence of bacterial adherence in the establishment of experimental mastitis in mice.
AB  - The possibility of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae to the epithelium of the mammary gland was investigated by inoculating them into this gland of mice. S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli did not adhere to alveolar epithelium in suckling or non-suckling mice. S. agalactiae adhered to alveolar epithelium in non-suckling mice but adhesion was not sufficiently strong to withstand suckling. Bacterial adherence probably does not play a significant role in the establishment of mastitis by these organisms.
TI  - Effect of Simplex liquid methyl methacrylate monomer on cells.
AB  - The effect of methyl methacrylate monomer used for polymerization of surgical bone cement on phagocytosis, blood cells, tissue cells in culture, and bacteria was investigated. A concentration of 0.5% monomer reduced the ability of macrophages in vitro to phagocytize cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis effectively. In vivo, 0.03 ml injected into mice also reduced the capacity of peritoneal macrophages to phagocytize bacteria. Extent of cellular damage to blood cells varied with concentration of monomer used and time of contact but, in general 0.5% was sufficient to alter morphology and viability of blood cells and tissue cells in culture. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils sustained more damage than other types of blood cells. Only minor alterations were detected from cooled, polymerized cement. These studies support the concept that the monomer, as well as mechanical and thermal factors, may be responsible for some of the tissue changes seen at the site of implant of bone cement following total joint arthroplastic surgery.
TI  - Cervical-vaginal flora of women with invasive cervical cancer.
AB  - The cervical-vaginal flora of 21 women with invasive cervical cancer was determined. The cultures yielded polymicrobial growth with anaerobic organisms predominating. As compared with other studies of vaginal flora, the cancer patients were found to have a decreased frequency of isolation of aerobic lactobacilli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococci, and an increased frequency of isolation of Escherichia coli and Bacteriodes species. The composition of the anaerobic vaginal flora in these patients is similar to that described for immunosuppressed renal transplant patients.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - The effect of methylmethacrylate on bacterial phagocytosis and killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The phagocytic and bactericidal activities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes  in the presence of methylmethacrylate were determined by in vitro techniques. It was found that methylmethacrylate in concentrations as low as 0.156 per cent significantly decreased the ability of leukocytes to phagocytose and kill strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The evidence indicates that methylmethacrylate impairs the killing more than the phagocytosis by the leukocytes.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - The effect of methylmethacrylate on chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The effect of methylmethacrylate on chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was evaluated by an in vitro method that involved migration of human leukocytes under agarose. Chemotactic factors produced during growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli remained chemotactically active in the presence of a methylmethacrylate concentration of 1.25 per cent, which was the highest tested. The methylmethacrylate also did not alter the activity of the chemotactic factor produced by zymosan activation of normal human serum. However, when methylmethacrylate was added to normal human serum prior to zymosan activation, a methylmethacrylate concentration of 0.312 per cent significantly depressed the subsequent zymosan-induced chemotactic activity and concentrations above 0.312 per cent abolished it. When methylmethacrylate was added to the polymorphonuclear leukocyte suspensions, there was significant depression of the migration of cells at a concentration of 0.312 per cent, and at concentrations of 0.625 and 1.25 per cent no leukocyte migration occurred.
TI  - The effect of methylmethacrylate on the bacterial inhibiting properties of normal human serum.
AB  - In vitro evaluation of the effect of known concentrations of methylmethacrylate on the bacterial inhibiting properties of normal human serum has been carried out. In low concentrations, methylmethacrylate was found to abolish almost completely the growth inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis by normal human serum. Normal human serum did not have an effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus. It did inhibit growth of Escherichia coli, but there was no reversal of this effect by methylmethacrylate.
TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of a choriogonadotropin-like protein in bacteria isolated from cancer patients.
AB  - By the use of specific antibody to human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) as well as to its beta-subunit, and the application of the indirect fluorescein-labeled and peroxidase-labeled antibody techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of a membrane (wall)-associated CG-similar immunoreactive protein in 15 strains of bacteria isolated from tissues of patients bearing malignant neoplasms. These microorganisms were classified as S. epidermidis, (12) E. coli (2), and a single strain of P. maltophilia (ATCC 13637). The absence of the CG-like antigen in other "cancer associated bacteria", Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 12818) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from patient with cancer of colon), demonstrated that not every "cancer associated bacteria" has the capability to synthesize the trophoblastic-like protein. The negative results obtained with a number of "noncancer control" bacteria of known origin, obtained from ATCC and from clinical samples, strongly supported the idea that the existance of these CG-like protein producing microorganisms is not a ubiquitous finding. The demonstration of a de novo bacterial biosynthesis of a protein having similar antigenic and biophysical properties to those of the human trophoblastic hormone, has great biological implications, especially if its biosynthesis is proven only in bacterial strains growing in the presence of cancer cells in which we have already demonstrated the presence of a similar antigen. The explanation of the phenomenon is unknown. Because of their origin, the potential of "genetic exchange" with subsequent expression of the mammalian gene by the bacterial cells becomes a possibility. It is also possible that the gene coding for the CG-like protein is normally present but inactive or repressed in all bacteria.

TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of five nitrofurans.
AB  - Five nitrofurans- nitrofurantoin, nifuratel, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and and  SQ 18,506--have been tested against 201 microbial strains. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, micrococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis were sensitive to all five compounds; furazolidone and SQ 18,506 were the most active against these species. Klebsiella aerogenes was less sensitive, and Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant. Nifuratel was inhibitory for some Candida albicans strains, and SQ 18,506 was highly active against this species. Nifuratel was judged overall to have superior in vitro antimicrobial properties to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - [Resistance of pyogenic bacteria during a period of five years (author's transl)].
AB  - The bacteriological results of 4113 clinical specimens (wound-swabs) were analysed. In 40 per cent of positive findings Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, furthermore, in decreasing frequency Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococci and haemolysing Streptococci. During this study a considerable quota of the examined strains was observed to show large fluctuation in sensitivity, but more than half of the isolates demonstrated increasing resistance against the chemotherapeutics tested. In order to reduce the development of resistance, our results ascertain the necessity for a scientific antibacterial therapy as well as the strict observance of hospital hygienic measures.
TI  - Survey of conjunctival flora in dogs with clinical signs of external eye disease.
AB  - Bacteria were isolated 68% of the time from the conjunctival sacs of 120 dogs with conjunctivitis, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, or corneal ulcerations. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated organism (68%); when both eyes were affected, S aureus was recovered from 29% of the dogs; and in dogs with 1 eye affected, S aureus was isolated from 23% of the affected eyes and in 18% of the nonaffected eyes. Other organisms recovered from eyes were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis (27%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (19%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (17%), Escherichia coli (10%), Bacillus spp (11%), and Proteus spp (7%). It was concluded that S aureus may appear as a primary pathogen in ocular disease. When 1 eye is clinically affected, S aureus can be a potential invader of the normal eye.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lower urinary tract pathogens in the dog and their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Ninety-six urine samples were collected by a sterile technique from 75 dogs affected with urinary tract disease (cystitis, urolithiasis, prostatitis, etc) involving bacteruria. The infecting organisms were isolated and tested against sensitivity discs (penicillin G, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole/trimethaprin and Sulphatriad). The commonest isolate was Escherichia coli, which was generally sensitive to several agents, though in eight cases it was resistant to all drugs. Next in order were Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus spp. A double infection was present in 11 cases. Further data give a breakdown for sex and the clinical diagnosis, neither of which was related to any particular organism.
TI  - Enumeration and identification of human leukemic lymphocytes by their natural binding of bacteria.
AB  - The recently described property of bacteria to bind to human lymphocytes was used to distinguish between normal and chronic leukemic lymphocyte (CLL) populations. Strains of the following bacteria were used in this study: Arizona hinshawii, Escherichia coli strains 1 and 2, Bacillus globigii, Brucella melitensis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains 1 and 2, Corynebacterium xerosis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For identification of immunoglobulin-bearing lymphocytes, a strain of E. coli that did not bind to human lymphocytes was coated with anti-human light-chain antibody. Labeling of lymphocytes with bacteria was promoted by centrifugation. In the eight CLL patients studied, in which greater than 90% of the lymphocytes were leukemic cells, 52 to 77% were labeled by anti-human light-chain antibody-E. coli, 80 to 93% were labeled by Br. melitensis, and 78 to 95% were labeled by E. coli 1 compared to 11 to 24, 11 to 22, and 30 to 44%, respectively, in normal individuals, Thus, Br. melitensis, E. coli 1, and the anti-human light-chain antibody-E. coli may have diagnostic value for CLL. The percentage of the lymphocyte population that bound each of the other bacteria varied from patient to patient. Preliminary results obtained by studying the pattern of binding of E. coli 2, B. globigii, Sa. lutea, or S. aureus by leukemic lymphocytes suggest that categories of CLL patients may be distinguished by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. II. Detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  - Human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against E coli. Blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against S epidermidis, and early growth of Streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. The concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.
TI  - Infection in infants and children.
AB  - Infection with Listeria monocytogenes is demonstrated over a 141/2 year period in 24 newborns, three infants 1 to 2 months of age, and two children. Comparison of the 22 cases of Listeria meningitis in newborns with 118 cases of neonatal meningitis due to other bacteria indicates a later onset of symptoms in cases of Listeria meningitis with a more favorable outcome than with most other agents. Treatment with ampicillin sodium appears effective. Monocytic cell increases in peripheral blood or CSF may be helpful in suspecting this diagnosis. The cases of Listeria meningitis in the older children were unusual. In one child it occurred as a concomitant infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis of a ventricular shunt. In the second case in an otherwise healthy child the acquisition of the bacteria from gerbils was suggested, but could not be confirmed.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.

TI  - Nitrate, fumarate, and oxygen as electron acceptors for a late step in microbial  heme synthesis.
AB  - Nitrate can serve as anaerobic electron acceptor for the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate. Two kinds of experiments indicated this: anaerobic protoporphyrin formation from protoporphyrinogen, followed spectrophotometrically, was markedly stimulated by addition of nitrate; and anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrinogen, determined by extraction procedures, was markedly stimulated by addition of nitrate. In contrast, anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrin was not dependent upon addition of nitrate. This was the first demonstration of the ability of nitrate to serve as electron acceptor for this late step of heme synthesis. Previous studies with mammalian and yeast mitochondria had indicated an obligatory requirement for molecular oxygen at this step. In confirmation of our previous preliminary report, fumarate was also shown to be an electron acceptor for anaerobic protoporphyrinogen oxidation in extracts of E. coli grown anaerobically on fumarate. For the first time, anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrinogen, but not from protoporphyrin, was shown to be dependent upon the addition of fumarate. The importance of these findings is 2-fold. First, they establish that enzymatic protoporphyrinogen oxidation can occur in the absence of molecular oxygen, in contrast to previous observations using mammalian and yeast mitochondria. Secondly, these findings help explain the ability of some facultative and anaerobic bacteria to form very large amounts of heme compounds, such as cytochrome pigments, when grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate or fumarate. In fact, denitrifying bacteria are known to form more cytochromes when grown anaerobically than during aerobic growth. An unexpected finding was that extracts of another bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, exhibited very little ability to oxidize protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin as compared to E. coli extracts. This finding suggests some fundamental differences in these two organisms in this key step in heme synthesis. It is known that these two facultative organisms also differ in that E. coli synthesizes cytochrome during both aerobic and anaerobic growth, while Staphylococcus only synthesizes cytochromes when grown aerobically.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - A study of skin diseases in dogs and cats. II. Microflora of the normal skin of dogs and cats.
AB  - A study of the microflora of the normal skin was undertaken in 10 dogs and 10 cats. Swabs were taken from the surface of the skin at 7 different sites (Fig. 1). Micrococcus spp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Acinetobacter spp. were found consistently in both species. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 9 dogs and 4 cats, and staphylococcus epidermidis from 7 dogs and 5 cats. Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas spp., and Alcaligenes spp. were found sporadically.
TI  - Comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  - The activity of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in Mueller-Hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal end points were determined using a modified Steers replicator. Ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except S. epidermidis against which BL-P1654 was most active. Median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for S. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), BL-P1654 (25); for S. epidermidis: BL-P1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for E. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), BL-P1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for Klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for Enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), BL-P1654 (12.5); for Proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6), carbenicillin (1.6), BL-P1654 (3.2); for P. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), BL-P1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). Bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. BL-P1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.
TI  - The autoinhibition activity of some microbial species.
AB  - Studies revealed that during the process of their reproduction some microorganisms produce substances inhibiting the development of the own populations. A method was developed to establish the phenomenon, distinguished by its simple application and dependable results. The phenomenon was noted with the species Staphylococcus, L. monocytogenes, Salmonealla, and E. coli, and was lacking in P. multocida, Brucella, Ery. rhusiopathiae, Bac. anthracis, and Bac. subtilis. It was found that the agent capable of producing an autoinhibitory effect in Staphylococcus epidermidis had no protein character. The term microbial autoinhibition is suggested to denote a phenomenon in which the own populations of a given strain of one and the same species of microorganisms are inhibited in their development by an agent produced by the strain itself.
TI  - The fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  - Units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Seratia marcesens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Paracolabacterum aerogenoides (Enterobacter hafriae), Mima polymorpha or Acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. When inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. When inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 C. Three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. These data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may be unnecessarily restrictive.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Intracolonic tensions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The relation of intracolonic gaseous tension to fecal microflora was investigated by mass spectrometric measurements of intracolonic O2 and CO2 in unanesthetized germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats; ip measurements were obtained in rats whose colons became perforated accidentally; fecal bacterial flora and cecal size were also determined. Gnotobiotes were monoassociated with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and were diassociated with E. coli plus B. fragilis and with Bacillus macerans plus an aerobic diphtheroid. Mean intracolonic Po2 in conventional rats (11.1 mmHg) was significantly lower than in germfree rats (12.8 mmHg); mean intracolonic Pco2 in conventionals (83.4 mmHg) was greater than in germfree rats (54.6 mmHg). Differences of Po2 values among all rats were slight. However, intracolonic Pco2 values were directly related to CO2 production by the normal intestinal flora, and were thus significantly lower in both germfree and gnotobiotic rats. Intraperitoneal tensions were independent of the status of rats, and the mean ip Po2 and Pco2 (38.9 and 49.1 mmHg, respectively) agreed with values in the literature. The enlarged cecum, characteristic of germfree rats, was also present in gnotobiotic rats. Counts of each bacterial species in feces of monoassociated rats were 10(8) to 10(10)/g; counts were progressively smaller in feces of diassociated rats and conventional rats (10(8) to 10(9)/g and 10(5) to 10(8)/g, respectively). Intracolonic gaseous tensions of CO2 clearly reflected the presence of a normal flora inconventional rats, and were inversely proportional to cecal size.
TI  - [Experience with amoxicillin therapy in urological field (author's transl)].
AB  - Amoxicillin (AMPC), an oral preparation of broad spectrum synthetic penicillin, was used for treatment of 10 cases with urological infection, and the following results were obtained. 1. AMPC at a daily dose of 750 approximately 1,500 mg was administered for 7 approximately 49 days to 5 cases of acute cystitis, 2 cases of acute epididymitis and one case each of calculous hydronephrosis, chronic prostatitis and postoperative cystitis. As the result, AMPC was found remarkably effective in 2 cases, effective in 7 cases and ineffective in one case; that is, the effective rate was 9/10 (90.0%). 2. Total 8 strains of bacteria, comprising 5 strains of Escherichia coli and one strain each of Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas, were isolated from the urine. These bacteria were relatively responsive to AMPC as well as to ABPC. 3. The side effect possibly due to AMPC was slight gastro-intestinal disorder only in 2 of 10 cases. No other side effect was observed.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  - Colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. Among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Since the microcontour of the canine distal urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina. The normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. It consisted principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. Estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-Streptococcus and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. A normal canine transient, Escherichia coli, and a normal resident, Corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. In contrast, human Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus (8.5 days). The commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. Thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the susceptibility to colonization.
TI  - Bacterial density in laparotomy wounds during gastro-instestinal operations.
AB  - Operation wounds were sampled quantitatively for aerobic bacteria in 56 patients  by the velvet pad rinse technique in a prospective, randomised study of abdominal operations (1) truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, (2) gastric or (3) colo-rectal operations, and (4) exploratory laparotomy. On entering the peritoneal cavity and prior to incision of the gastro-intestinal tract the bacterial density in the wounds did not differ significantly between these four types of operations, the median being 5.4X10(-1) viable counts/cm2 (range 0.7-135.8). In all series of operations the median bacterial density was increased prior to closure of the wounds, significantly so after colo-retal operations, being 21.3X10(-1) viable counts/cm2 (range 1.1-144.4), caused by a rise in density of aerobic intestinal species, especially Escherichia coli. Regardless of type of operation, all wounds were contaminated during operation by aerobic commensals of the skin and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, in particular by Staphylococcus epidermidis, this species not differing significiantly in density from the beginning to the end of operation. This same study revealed that within the operation wound, sites of low or even zero bacterial density were close to sites with a high density. It is suggested that postoperative wound infection is closely related to the density of the different species of bacteria present in the operation wound at closure.
TI  - [Experience in use of amoxicillin for treatment of acute cystitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Seventeen cases of acute simple cystitis were treated by oral administration of amoxicillin at a daily dose of 1.0 g (250 mg X 4 in a day) for consecutive 7 days, and the following results were obtained. 1. Amoxicillin was remarkably effective in 11 of total 17 cases, effective in 2, slightly effective in 2 and non-effective in 2. 2. In terms of effect against isolated bacteria, amoxicillin was remarkably effective against 6 of 11 strains of E. coli, effective against 2, slightly effective against 2 and non-effective against 1, remarkably effective against 2 of 3 strains of Proteus mirabilis and non-effective against 1, and remarkably effective against one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. 3. There was no severe side effect specially to be mentioned.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in materials from patients with nonspecific odontogenic infections].
AB  - The results of bacteriological studies made between 1964 and 1971 by workers at the Varia Laboratory, Institute of Medical Microbiology on 767 patients treated at the Clinic of Gnathofacial Surgery, Department of Medicine, Friedrich Schiller University at Jena, are evaluated. The testees (x=275) were included in groups with specific diagnoses, and a breakdown was made according to the detection of aerobic pus-forming germs. Gram-positive cocci were detected in 92% of the cases and their pathogenetic representatives, 76,5% of the cases. Rodshaped germs (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas) were observed only in 37,9% of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 62,5%, was the most frequently observed species. It was followed, in order of frequency of detection, by greening streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Monoinfection was far more frequently observed than multi-infection. Also, the problems associated with the differentiation of streptococci are pointed out since other investigators found streptococci to be the most frequent agents producing odontogenic infections.
TI  - Experimental evaluation of the velvet pad rinse technique as a microbiological sampling method.
AB  - The use of velvet pads glued to aluminium foil has been evaluated as a microbiological sampling method in quantitative bacterial recovery experiments, and the efficiency and precision have been determined. The velvet pads uptake of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.93 (or 93 per cent) after sampling from a test surface on blood agar, while the release by subsequent imprinting on blood agar was 0.02, the median effective transfer being 0.02. A mechanical rinse and shake procedure of the velvet pad in 0.9 per cent saline followed by centrifugation and surface plating significantly increased the median release to 0.66, the median effective transfer being 0.61. There was no difference in uptake, release and effective transfer between a pure culture of S. epidermidis and a mixed culture of S. epiderimidis and Escherichia coli. Storage of the velvet pad in 0.9 per cent saline for 2 h at room temperature did not influence bacterial recovery significantly, in contrast to a significant decrease after storage in saline for 24 h or storage in a dry Petri dish for 2 h. The high and fairly constant efficiency of bacterial recovery of the velvet pad rinse technique suggests that it could be employed clinically.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - Relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  - In 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. Infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. In a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. The significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.
TI  - Endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. The pyrogenic response of rabbit to group A streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or TCA is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. The pyrogenicity can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of the material by lysozyme. Peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group B and L streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. Spirillum serpens and Escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. Repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. Cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. Rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to S. aureus and group A streptococcus peptidoglycans. Intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages of the degenerative and necrotic process. Local Shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. The results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. Non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. These properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. The data presented suggest the role of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.
TI  - Effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  - Sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin S by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the N-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. In concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Eschierichia coli but not of Streptococcus faecalis. Viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by cyanate; however, production of [14-C] carbon dioxide from [1-14-C] glucose and the iodination of 125-I during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. Cyanate is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of H-2-O-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). Since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they are due to amino carbamylation.
TI  - The effectiveness of various antibiotics in methyl methacrylate.
AB  - The effectiveness of different antibiotics mixed with Simplex P has been tested in vitro. A laboratory model was designed to simulate the constant immersion of bone cement in tissue fluid. Clindamycin, and to a lesser extent Cephalothin, were shown to be effective when used in this manner against Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis. Effective inhibition of Gram-negative organisms could not be demonstrated with any of the antibiotics tested. The addition of up to 3 grams of antibiotic powder per unit of 40 grams of Simplex P did not appear to alter the expansive properties of the cement. Such release of antibiotics as did occur was thought to be related to the slow absorption of water by the slightly porous methyl methacrylate.
TI  - Biological defense mechanisms. Evidence for the participation of superoxide in bacterial killing by xanthine oxidase.
AB  - Incubation of either Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli with a sufficiently high concentration of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme capable of reducing oxygen to superoxide (O2-), resulted in the death of the microorganisms. Protection against the killing os S. epidermidis by xanthine oxidase was afforded by superoxide dismutase, an enzyme which converts O2- to O2 and H2O2, and also by catalase, which destroys H2O2. These findings indicate that neither O2- nor H2O2 were able to kill S. epidermidis under the experimental conditions, but that the bactericidal agent was the product of a reaction between O2- and H2O2. By contrast, E. coli was protected by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. With this organism, therefore, H2O2 appears to have been the bactericidal agent.
TI  - Intramammary infections in the sow during the peripartum period.
AB  - The incidence and ype of aerobic bacteria causing intramammary infection (IMI) in two groups of peripartum sows were determined. The incidence of IMI in 24 sows near farrowing was 30.2 percent; the incidence in 16 machine-milked sows was 81.0 percent. Numerous mixed IMI were detected. The bacterium causing most IMI was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by beta hemolytic streptococci, aslpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids. The beta hemolytic streptococci and E. coli cultures were studied in detail. The relationship of bacterial IMI to agalactiae toxemia is discussed.
TI  - Growth inhibitory activity of deoxyribonucleic acid-containing factor(s) isolated from lepromatous lesions.
AB  - Deoxyribonucleic acid-containing factor(s) isolated from Mycobacterium leprae suspensions obtained from lepromas of nine patients showed growth inhibitory activity against Micrococcus and both orange-red-pigmented and coccoid mutants of mycobacteria. No growth inhibition was observed for parent mycobacterial species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
TI  - Lipid peroxidation by human blood phagocytes.
AB  - Cell suspensions enriched in human blood monocytes, obtained from normal peripheral blood by sedimentation on sodium diatrizoate-Ficoll gradients or from the blood of patients with neutropenia and monocytosis, accumulated malonyldialdehyde, a labile catabolite of lipid peroxidation, during incubations with polystyrene beads or heat-killed Staphylococcus epidermidis. Mixed blood leukocytes principally composed of granulocytes or granulocytes purified by density gradient sedimentation did not accumulate malonyldialdehyde during incubations with these particles, but did when ingesting particles containing linolenate. The phospholipid fatty acid composition of monocyte-enriched and purified granulocyte preparations from the same donors were compared. The molar fraction of arachidonate (20:4) in phospholipids from monocyte-rich preparations was 62% greater than that of purified granulocytes. The findings indicate that human monocytes, possibly because of a greater content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, peroxidize a greater quantity of endogenous lipids than granulocytes during endocytosis. Normal human granulocytes have the capacity to peroxidize ingested lipids. However, mixed leukocytes from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease produced little malonyldialdehyde when engulfing linolenate-containing particles. Therefore the capacity to peroxidize lipid is related to cellular oxygen metabolism, a function in which chronic granulomatous disease granulocytes are dificient. Malonyldialdehyde chemically prepared by hydrolysis of tetramethoxypropane, by extraction from peroxidized linolenic acid, or purified from extracts of phagocytizing rabbit alveolar macrophages had bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Therefore, toxic catabolites of lipid hydroperoxides may potentiate the bactericidal activity of hydrogen peroxide in mononuclear phagocytes.
TI  - Enhanced toxicity for mice of 6-mercaptopurine with bacterial endotoxin.
AB  - The toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine was potentiated by 2 mg of either Escherichia coli 026:B6 B endotoxin or Salmonella typhosa 0901 W endotoxin per kg. Nonlethal doses of heat-killed, gram-negative bacteria were also capable of potentiating the lethality of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Salmonella minnesota S, the wild-type strain, and S. minnesota Re 595, a mutant containing only the lipid A and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate moiety of the endotoxin molecule, exhibited the same capability to enhance the toxic action of 6-MP. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) did not affect the clearance of 6-MP from the circulation, but did alter its apparent metabolism as indicated by blood levels of a metabolite, 6-thiouric acid. The concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in mice 18 h after injection of 100 mg of 6-MP per kg simultaneously with 2 mg of LPS per kg was significantly elevated over normal values. However, these BUN values were significantly less than those resulting from the administration of one mean lethal dose of either agent. The clearance from the circulation of the gram-negative organism E. coli HB, or the gram-positive organism Staphylococcus epidermidis S, was not affected by 6-MP. Endotoxin had no effect on the clearance of S. epidermidis S, but inhibited that of E. coli HB. When 6-MP and LPS were administered simultaneously with either bacterial species, only the clearance of E. coli HB was inhibited. Mice were protected from the lethality associated with combinations of 6-MP and LPS by (i) prior treatment with phenobarbital, (ii) caffeine, (iii) methylprednisolone, and (iv) polymyxin B sulfate. With the exception of caffeine, each regimen protected mice against the lethal effects of 400 mg of 6-MP per kg, and methylprednisolone or polymyxin B protected mice against 8 mg of LPS per kg.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of spectinomycin.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities of spectinomycin hydrochloride were tested against a variety of bacteria. The antibiotic was inhibitory at 31.2 mug/ml to most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Concentrations of antibiotic exhibiting bactericidal activity exceeded the inhibitory concentration by at least fourfold. Regression graphs were plotted for results obtained with 30-, 100-, 200-, and 300-mug spectinomycin discs; tentative interpretative standards are proposed.
TI  - Severe oral lesions in chickens caused by ingestion of dietary fusariotoxin T-2.
AB  - Fusariotoxin T-2 is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium tricinctum which was implicated in moldy corn toxicosis of farm animals. Graded concentrations of dietary fusariotoxin T-2 (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mug/g, respectively) were given to groups of 40 chickens. Raised yellowish-white lesions on the mouth parts were produced by all concentrations, and the size of the lesions was dose-related. The growth rate was reduced significantly (P < 0.05) by concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 mug/g. The mouth fluid of the affected birds contained greatly increased numbers of bacteria, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, which proved avirulent when inoculated into scarified tissue of control birds. Microscopy examinations of the lesions revealed a fibrinous surface layer, intermediate layers containing invaginations filled with rods and cocci, and a heavy infiltration of the underlying tissues with granular leukocytes. These data suggest that the role of fusariotoxin T-2 in field cases of moldy corn toxicosis should be reinvestigated since oral lesions were not mentioned in the original descriptions of the disease. However, the lesions bear some features of those characteristic of the third or septic angina stage of alimentary toxic aleukia, a nutritional toxicosis of humans produced by eating grains infested with F. tricinctum.
TI  - Cephapirin: in vitro antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - Cephapirin, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of cephalothin. Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by cephapirin concentrations of 0.09 to 12.5 mug/ml. S. epidermidis, S. viridans, S. pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumonia isolates were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml. The Enterococcus required a concentration of 25 mug of antibiotic per ml for inhibition. Approximately 65% of Escherichia coli, and all Klebsiella, indole-negative Proteus, and Salmonella strains tested were inhibited by the drug. Serratia, Pseudomonas, indole-positive Proteus, and Erwinia strains were highly resistant. Inoculum size was not an important factor in determining the level of sensitivity of S. aureus to cephapirin. The antibiotic does not appear to be significantly bound to serum protein. In vitro development of resistance to the drug was demonstrated with two isolates of S. aureus.
TI  - Influence of glucose levels on the in vitro phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils.
AB  - A previously developed in vitro method for studying the phagocytosis of bacteria  and particles by human neutrophils was used to investigate the influence of different glucose levels on phagocytosis. It was found that high glucose levels (200, 400, and 800 mg of glucose/100 ml) significantly depressed the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli. At very low glucose levels, a somewhat decreased phagocytic activity was noted. The strongest phagocytic activity occurred at glucose concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/100 ml. A second effect noted at the higher (200, 400 and 800 mg/100 ml) glucose concentrations was a decreased adhesiveness of the neutrophils to solid surfaces. The mechanism of the decrease in phagocytosis and in neutrophil adhesiveness at higher glucose levels is unknown, but it is not linked to increased osmotic pressures due to the presence of glucose, as ethanol, at the same and even higher osmolal concentrations, had no effect on the phagocytosis. These results show that not only the phagocytic activity of those neutrophils that do adhere to a solid surface is diminished at higher glucose concentrations but also that fewer neutrophils adhere to solid surfaces at higher glucose levels. These two phenomena combined may provide at least part of the explanation for the well-known decrease in resistance to bacterial infections of diabetics.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
TI  - Formation of protoporphyrin from coproporphyrinogen in extracts of various bacteria.
AB  - The enzyme system capable of converting coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin was  demonstrated in the soluble fraction of extracts of Pseudomonas fluorescens grown aerobically, of P. denitrificans grown anaerobically under denitrifying conditions, and of Escherichia coli grown both aerobically and anaerobically. Protoporphyrin accumulation by each of these extracts occurred only if the assay was conducted aerobically. Attempts to replace this oxygen requirement with several alternate electron acceptors were not successful. The conversion of coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin could not be demonstrated in extracts of the heme-containing organisms Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Differential light scattering: a physical method for identifying living bacterial cells.
AB  - Differential light scattering techniques appear to represent an attractive physical method for the rapid identification of various microorganisms. Certain general results of inverse scattering theory suggest strongly that characteristic of each distinct microorganism that scatters light is an essentially unique scattering pattern, i.e., unique differential scattered intensity and polarization. Although a mathematically rigorous inversion procedure seems impractical at this time, the use of detailed differential scattered intensity data as an identification fingerprint shows considerable. promise. Published measurements on nonbiological scatterers confirm this possibility. A variety of calculations are presented that contrast the expected scattering characteristics of certain microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, B. anthracis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and the spores of B. mcgaterium and B. cereus. Experimental and instrumentation difficulties and possible procedures are discussed. A review and laboration of some applicable features of Rayleigh-Gans scattering are included as an appendix.
TI  - The preparation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from whole bacteria.
AB  - 1. A simple method for the preparation of ribonuclease-free ribosomal RNA is described in which ribonuclease-deficient bacteria are treated with acetone and the RNA is extracted with phenol and purified by precipitating it with potassium acetate. The treatment with acetone appears to render the cell wall permeable to RNA but not to DNA during the extraction with phenol. The method thus avoids the need to disrupt the bacteria and greatly simplifies the subsequent purification. 2. The method has been used successfully with ribonuclease-deficient strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The recovered purified RNA accounts for about 70% of the total ribosomal RNA and shows the normal sedimentation pattern of the 16s and 23s components in the analytical centrifuge.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
TI  - Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms.
AB  - Yotis, William (Loyola University, Hines, Ill.), and Ronald Stanke. Bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci and other microorganisms. J. Bacteriol. 92:1285-1289. 1966.-Progesterone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric and manometric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of progesterone. The organisms tested consisted of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Gaffkya tetragena, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella paratyphi, and Proteus vulgaris. Antibacterial action was shown by progesterone only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 20 mug of progesterone per ml. Pregnenolone, 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one, and 5alpha-pregnane also possessed antistaphylococcal properties, whereas pregnanolone, pregnandione, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not. The bacteriostatic action of progesterone on staphylococci was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation, and it was reduced in the presence of oxygen. In the presence of 20 mug of progesterone per ml, there was significant reduction in the oxidation by resting staphylococcal suspensions or utilization by staphylococci of pyruvate as an energy source during growth.
