TI  == effects of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens m1 isolated from kefir grains on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection using mouse and intestinal cell models.
AB  == a potential probiotic strain, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens m1, was previously isolated from kefir grains, which are used to manufacture the traditional fermented drink kefir. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lb. kefiranofaciens m1 on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) infection, using mice and intestinal cell models. balb/c mice were daily administrated with  either phosphate buffered saline or lb. kefiranofaciens m1 at 2x10(8) cfu/mouse per day intragastrically for 7 d. intragastric challenges with ehec (2x10(9) cfu/mouse) were conducted on d 0, 4, and 7 after treatment. administration of lb. kefiranofaciens m1 was able to prevent ehec infection-induced symptoms, intestinal damage, renal damage, bacterial translocation, and shiga toxin penetration. furthermore, the mucosal ehec-specific iga responses were increased  after lb. kefiranofaciens m1 administration in the ehec-infected mouse system. additionally, in vitro, lb. kefiranofaciens m1 was shown to have a protective effect on caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers; the bacteria limited ehec-induced cell death and reduced the loss of epithelial integrity. these findings support the potential of lb. kefiranofaciens m1 treatment as an approach to preventing ehec infection and its  effects.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria within the consortium of a kefir grain by  sequencing 16s rdna variable regions.
AB  == the microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing. dna was extracted from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16s rdna v1 and v2 regions. to guarantee a good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations,  dna amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant or to the less abundant bacterial groups. the amplified fragments were cloned in escherichia coli and then sequenced. sequences of the v1 region were gathered into 5 groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public library. the v1 region allowed the identification of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, l. kefir, l. parakefir, and lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the identification of leuconostocs at species level. among  16s rdna variable regions, the v2 region showed the highest variability between leuconostoc species. nevertheless, even in the v2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective identification of l. mesenteroides. the methodology described here allowed detection of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.
