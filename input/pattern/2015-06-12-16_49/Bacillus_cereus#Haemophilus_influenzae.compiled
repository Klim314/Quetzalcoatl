TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Safety assessment of recalled Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines--United States, 2007-2008.
AB  - PURPOSE: On 13 December 2007, Merck & Co., Inc. voluntarily recalled 1.2 million  doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines that had been distributed since April 2007 for concerns regarding potential Bacillus cereus contamination. Enhanced postrecall surveillance was conducted to detect vaccine-associated B. cereus infections. METHODS: We reviewed reports involving recalled Hib vaccines received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1 April 2007-29 February 2008. For each reported death, autopsy review sought evidence of B. cereus infections. For each specified outcome, the proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) were calculated to compare the recalled Hib vaccines with the manufacturer's nonrecalled Hib vaccines in the VAERS databases. On 20 December 2007, we used the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) to solicit nongastrointestinal vaccine-associated B. cereus infections, and requested B. cereus isolates for genotyping to compare with the manufacturing facility isolate. RESULTS: VAERS received 75 reports involving recalled Hib vaccines; none described a confirmed B. cereus infection. Comparative analyses did not reveal disproportionate reporting of specified outcomes for recalled Hib vaccines. The Epi-X posting triggered one report of vaccine-associated B. cereus bacteremia from a child who received a nonrecalled Hib vaccine manufactured by Merck; the genotypes of isolates from the patient and the manufacturing facility differed. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of vaccine-associated B. cereus infection had been found in recipients of recalled Hib vaccines. Conducting laboratory surveillance through Epi-X was feasible and may enhance public health response capacities for future vaccine safety emergencies.
TI  - Using shotgun sequence data to find active restriction enzyme genes.
AB  - Whole genome shotgun sequence analysis has become the standard method for beginning to determine a genome sequence. The preparation of the shotgun sequence clones is, in fact, a biological experiment. It determines which segments of the genome can be cloned into Escherichia coli and which cannot. By analyzing the complete set of sequences from such an experiment, it is possible to identify genes lethal to E. coli. Among this set are genes encoding restriction enzymes which, when active in E. coli, lead to cell death by cleaving the E. coli genome at the restriction enzyme recognition sites. By analyzing shotgun sequence data sets we show that this is a reliable method to detect active restriction enzyme genes in newly sequenced genomes, thereby facilitating functional annotation. Active restriction enzyme genes have been identified, and their activity demonstrated biochemically, in the sequenced genomes of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 and Methylococcus capsulatus.
TI  - Marine algae: screening for a potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study was done to investigate the antimicrobial potentiality of the marine algae collected from different coastal regions of Gujarat and screened for the same. Twenty-six marine algae belonging to Rhodophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Phaeophyceae were screened for their potential antibacterial activity against five clinically important bacterial strains, namely Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus flavus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas testosterone. Acetone and methanol were used for extraction; and the extracted yield was more when the solvent used was methanol. The antibacterial activity was done by both Agar disc diffusion method and Agar ditch method. The five bacterial strains showed varied response towards marine algal extracts. The most susceptible bacteria was B. cereus followed by K. pneumoniae and C. freundii while the most resistant bacteria were M. flavus and P. testosteroni. Among the 26 algae screened, E. intestinalis was the most potent alga and thus, this alga was selected for further studies. E. intestinalis was extracted in petroleum ether, 1,4-dioxan, acetone, methanol and DMF, and their antibacterial activity was studied against the above-stated five bacterial strains using agar disc method. Maximum extractive value of E. intestinalis was in methanol (2.05%) and minimum was in acetone (0.38%). The most susceptible bacteria was K. pneumoniae and maximum antibacterial activity was shown by petroleum ether extract and minimum was shown by 1,4-dioxan extract. The most resistant bacteria were M. flavus and C. freundii. The MIC values of E. intestinalis extracts ranged from 2500-9.765 microg/0.5 ml against B. cereus and K. pneumoniae. From these results it is concluded that the acetone extract of E. intestinalis is the most potent extract and can be used as a lead molecule in drug discovery in inhibiting some of the bacterial strains. E. intestinalis can be used as a promising novel marine antimicrobial agent in the coming years.

TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery between September 1 and December 31, 2003. Aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (MIC(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. However, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h vitreous group for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. Moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. The pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous levels can be achieved after topical administration. Further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - A novel surfactant nanoemulsion with a unique non-irritant topical antimicrobial  activity against bacteria, enveloped viruses and fungi.
AB  - A novel non-ionic surfactant nanoemulsion designated 8N8 has been tested for its  biocidal activity. One percent 8N8 produced effective bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Vibrio cholerae in 15 minutes. In contrast, most enteric gram-negative bacteria were resistant to 8N8. One percent 8N8 was also virucidal within 15 minutes for all tested enveloped viruses, including Herpes simplex type 1, influenza A and vaccinia viruses. One percent 8N8 also demonstrated fungistatic activity on Candida albicans. The rapid and non-specific inactivation of vegetative bacteria and enveloped viruses, in addition to its fungistatic activity and low toxicity in experimental animals, makes 8N8 a potential candidate for use as a topical biocidal agent.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - A Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family.
AB  - The complete sequence of a Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family of putative  helicases showed conservation of all seven motifs typical of this family. Bcsnf predicted a protein of 1064 aa where the conserved SNF2 domain was located at the carboxy terminus, whereas the 633 amino-terminal aa showed no homology to any protein in the databases. A putative transcriptional start was identified by primer extension, indicating that Bcsnf is not a part of a larger operon. No phenotypical changes were observed after insertional inactivation of Bcsnf. The completely sequenced genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium and Haemophilus influenzae contain one ORF each with similarity to the SNF2 family: MG018 and HI0616, respectively. A phylogenetic tree of the SNF2 family showed that BcSNF and MG018 were most closely related, and appeared closer to the eukaryotic members of the SNF2 family than to the two other bacterial members of the family, HepA from Escherichia coli and HI0616.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Fleroxacin (Ro23-6240; AM 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and A-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. Fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of Enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was also extremely active against Aeromonas hydrophila and Haemophilus influenzae isolates with MIC90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other Pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for three different species of coagulase-negative Staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. Streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. Fleroxacin was also active against group JK-diphtheroids and Bacillus cereus. The overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of A-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Enzyme immunoassays in which biotinillated beta-lactamase is used for the detection of microbial antigens.
AB  - The performance characteristics of enzyme immunoassays are determined to a great  extent by the enzyme-substrate system utilized for the immunoassay. Beta-lactamases (penicillin amido-beta-lactamhydrolase EC 3.5.2.6) offer a number of advantages which might make them useful in immunoassay systems. We linked beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus with biotin and used the biotinillated enzyme to devise immunoassay systems for the detection of a number of microbial antigens. An assay system in which antibodies to the polyribitol phosphate antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b were used was capable of detecting between 0.4 and 1.6 ng of that antigen. Similarly, an assay in which antibodies to the common antigens of adenoviruses and biotin-linked beta-lactamase were used was capable of detecting between 1 and 10 50% tissue culture infective doses of a strain of enteric-type adenovirus. When applied to the detection of rotavirus, a similar system in which biotinillated beta-lactamase was used was capable of detecting small amounts of antigen in a standard rotavirus preparation. This assay could also detect virus in 36 of 37 stool specimens from children with rotavirus gastroenteritis. The positive specimens could easily be distinguished from negative ones by the naked eye, and a permanent record of the qualitative results could be obtained by the use of a standard office photocopying machine. Beta-lactamases have promise for use in practical enzyme immunoassay systems, especially in situations in which expensive colorimetric instrumentation is not available.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  
TI  - Doxycycline in serum and bronchial secretions.
AB  - The concentration of doxycycline hydrochloride was measured in serum and bronchial secretions in five patients with chronic bronchitis receiving doxycycline orally in normal therapeutic dosage for seven days (200 mg day 1, 100 mg days 2 to 7). After the loading dose of 200 mg, serum concentrations ranged between 5-40 and 3-45 mug/ml (mean 4-33 mug/ml) at 3 hours, declining to between 2-28 and 1-21 mug/ml (mean 1-71 mug/ml) at 23 hours. The mean serum levels for days 2 to 7 were 2-15, 1-79, and 1-38 at 3, 8, and 23 hours respectively. There was considerable individual variability and a wide range of concentrations of doxycycline in the sputum (0-07 to 2-10 mug/ml, mean 0-34 mug/ml). During the course of treatment there was a progressive increase in sputum levels and sputum/serum concentration ratios. There was no correlation between sputum concentration and degree of purulence. The clinical efficacy of doxycycline does not appear to be related to sputum concentration, although the progressive increase in sputum doxycycline levels may be relevant in preventing recurrence of acute infection when the drug is administered as long-term prophylactic therapy.
TI  - Polysaccharides of the genus Bacillus cross-reactive with the capsular polysaccharides of Diplococcus pneumoniae type 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis group A.
AB  - We studied 174 strains of the genus Bacillus for cross-reacting antigens to the capsular polysaccharides of groups A and C meningococcus, types I and III pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Cross-reactions were detected by immunodiffusion in agarose gel by using type-specific antisera and confirmed by absorption and inhibition experiments. Of 20 Bacillus pumilis strains, six had an antigen cross-reacting with group A meningococcal polysaccharide. Other cross-reactions included one strain of B. pumilis with H. influenzae type b, one of B. cereus var. mycoides with pneumococcus type III, and one of B. alvei with both type b and SIII polysaccharides. These cross-reacting antigens are polysaccharides of vegetative cells and may be extracellular in location. Because these bacilli have antigens cross-reacting with the virulence factors of pyogenic bacteria, they may, as normal flora, be an antigenic stimulus for "natural" serum anti-capsular antibodies to the type b Haemophilus and group A meningococcus polysaccharides.
TI  - Tetracycline levels in bronchial secretions.
AB  - The excretion of tetracycline HCl in sputum was studied in 42 hospital patients suffering from various respiratory disorders who were receiving oral tetracycline therapy of 1.0 gram daily in divided doses.The tetracycline levels were estimated biologically by a cup-plate agar diffusion method using B. cereus. Two separate methods of sputum homogenization are described: enzymic liquefaction with pronase, a powerful proteolytic enzyme, and ultracentrifugation at 103,000 g for three hours which sediments the viscous mucoids leaving 80-90% as a clear, non-viscous supernatant. The two methods allowed duplicate assays on sputum samples and generally showed close agreement. The ultracentrifugation technique is favoured for normal purposes because of its simplicity and the avoidance of any biochemical interference.A close correlation was shown between the tetracycline levels in sputum samples and the average serum level for each patient. Over the serum tetracycline range 1.0-5.0 mug/ml, the mean sputum tetracycline levels after centrifugation were 23-18%, and the average level was 0.50 mug/ml.The levels found in sputum were compared with the minimum inhibitory concentration of tetracycline for strains of H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae. Eighty-six percent of 29 H. influenzae strains tested and all Strep. pneumoniae strains tested were sensitive to 0.5 mug/ml tetracycline. The remaining H. influenzae strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 mug/ml or higher, a tetracycline level in sputum which appeared to be outside the mean range at the oral dosage of 1.0 gram daily. Hence it is suggested that a small proportion of patients with lower respiratory tract infections due to H. influenzae would be unresponsive, or only partially responsive, to this usual therapeutic range of tetracycline.

TI  - Ultraviolet irradiation of DNA in vitro and in vivo produces a 3d thymine-derived product.
AB  - A new thymine-derived product was separated from DNA irradiated with utlraviolet  light in vitro and in vivo. This compound was mistaken to be thymine homodiner (T=T) by other workers because it is chromatographically indistinguishable from T=T in most eluents. It has absorbancy maximums at 312, 312, and 300 millimicrons in neutral, pH 2, and pH 11 aqueous solutions, respectively. When it is irradiated in aqueous solution with wavelengths of 360 and 313 millimicrons its spectrum reverts to one similar to that of thymine. Therefore, at least three thymine-derived products can be detected in ultraviolet irradiated DNA, namely the homodimer, a material with absorbancy maximum at 312 millimicrons, and a "minor" product suggested by others to be a dimer of cytosine and thymine. In cells, the latter two are formed in aboult equal amounts. While these three products were shown to exist in the acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet irradiated DNA, a material with absorbancy maximum at about 310 millimicrons was demonstrated to form in ultraviolet irradiated DNA without further treatment. The magnitude of this spectral increase varied directly with the incrcase in the adenine-thymine contents in the DNA as shlown by differential transmittance spectra of the irradiated Micrococcus lysodeikticus, calf thymus, Bacillus cereus, and Hemophilus influenzae DNA.

Bacteriol. 86:713-716. 1963.-The 3- and 5- nucleotidase activity in various bacterial species was investigated. Both enzymes were found in bacterial extracts in varying proportions. The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.
