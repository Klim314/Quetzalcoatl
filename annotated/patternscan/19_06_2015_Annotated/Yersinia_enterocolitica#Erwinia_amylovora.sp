TI  == intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with entamoeba histolytica by eric-pcr.
AB  == enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric)-pcr was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with entamoeba histolytica. the dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were  also tested. the intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of eric-pcr bands in the control healthy rabbit  was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. eric-pcr bands of orally  inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). the numbers of the eric-pcr bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i.  were above 95 % with sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, erwinia amylovora and salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 %  with xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, yersinia enterocolitica subsp., shigella flexneri, s. meliloti enterobacterial, yersinia pestis, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and escherichia coli. the prominent bacteria had changed after e. histolytica infection. the dnastar of staple of eric-pcr showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (e. coli, shigella, and salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with e. histolytica.

TI  == detection of type iii secretion genes as a general indicator of bacterial virulence.
AB  == type iii secretion systems of gram-negative bacteria are specific export machineries for virulence factors which allow their translocation to eukaryotic cells. since they correlate with bacterial pathogenicity, their presence is used  as a general indicator of bacterial virulence. by comparing the genetic relationship of the major type iii secretion systems we found the family of genes encoding the inner-membrane channel proteins represented by the yersinia enterocolitica lcrd (synonym yscv) and its homologous genes from other species an ideal component for establishing a general detection approach for type iii secretion systems. based on the genes of the lcrd family we developed gene probes for gram-negative human, animal and plant pathogens. the probes comprise lcrd from y. enterocolitica, sepa from enteropathogenic escherichia coli, inva from salmonella typhimurium, mxia from shigella sonnei, as well as hrcv from erwinia amylovora. in addition we included as a control probe the flha gene from e. coli  k-12 to validate our approach. flha is part of the flagellar export apparatus which shows a high degree of similarity with type iii secretions systems, but is  not involved in pathogenicity. the probes were evaluated by screening a series of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. the probes detected type iii secretion in pathogens where such systems were either known or were expected to be present, whereas no positive hybridization signals could be found in non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. gram-positive bacteria were devoid of known type iii secretion systems. no interference due to the genetic similarity between the type iii secretion system and the flagellar export apparatus was observed. however, potential type iii secretion systems could be detected in bacteria where no such systems have been described yet. the presented approach provides therefore a useful tool for the assessment of the virulence potential of bacterial isolates of human, animal and plant origin. moreover, it is a powerful  means for a first safety assessment of poorly characterized strains intended to be used in biotechnological applications.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == yscu, a yersinia enterocolitica inner membrane protein involved in yop secretion.
AB  == pathogenic yersiniae secrete antihost yop proteins by a recently discovered secretion pathway which is also encountered in several animal and plant pathogens. the components of the export machinery are encoded by the vira (lcra), virb (lcrb), and virc (lcrc) loci of the 70-kb pyv plasmid. in the present paper  we describe yscu, the last gene of the virb locus. we determined the dna sequence and mutated the gene on the pyv plasmid. after inactivation of yscu, the mutant strain was unable to secrete yop proteins. the topology of yscu was investigated  by the analysis of yscu-phoa translational fusions generated by tnphoa transposition. this showed that the 40.3-kda yscu product contains four transmembrane segments anchoring a large cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain to  the inner membrane. yscu is related to spa40 from shigella flexneri, to spas from salmonella typhimurium, to flhb from bacillus subtilis, and to hrpn from pseudomonas solanacearum.

TI  == homology between the hrpo protein of pseudomonas solanacearum and bacterial proteins implicated in a signal peptide-independent secretion mechanism.
AB  == a region of approximately 22 kb of dna defines the large hrp gene cluster of strain gmi1000 of pseudomonas solanacearum. the majority of mutants that map to this region have lost the ability to induce disease symptoms on tomato plants and are no longer able to elicit a hypersensitive reaction (hr) on tobacco, a non-host plant. in this study we present the complementation analysis and nucleotide sequence of a 4772 bp region of this hrp gene cluster. three complete  open reading frames (orfs) are predicted within this region. the corresponding putative proteins, hrpn, hrpo and hpap, have predicted sizes of 357, 690 and 197  amino acids, respectively, and predicted molecular weights of 38,607, 73,990 and  21,959 dalton, respectively. hrpn and hrpo are both predicted to be hydrophobic proteins with potential membrane-spanning domains and hpap is rich in proline residues. a mutation in hpap (for hrp associated) does not affect the hr on tobacco or the disease on tomato plants. none of the proteins is predicted to have an n-terminal signal sequence, which would have indicated that the proteins  are exported. considerable sequence similarities were found between hrpo and eight known or predicted prokaryotic proteins: lcrd of yersinia pestis and y. enterocolitica, flbf of caulobacter crescentus, flha of bacillus subtilis, mxia and virh of shigella flexneri, inva of salmonella typhimurium and hrpc2 of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. these homologies suggest that certain hrp genes of phytopathogenic bacteria code for components of a secretory system, which is related to the systems for secretion of flagellar proteins, ipa proteins of shigella flexneri and the yersinia yop proteins. furthermore, these homologous proteins have the common feature of being implicated in a distinct secretory mechanism, which does not require the cleavage of a signal peptide. the sequence  similarity between hrpo and hrpc2 is particularly high (66% identity and 81% similarity) and the amino acid sequence comparison between these two proteins presented here reveals the first such sequence similarity to be shown between hrp proteins of p. solanacearum and x. campestris. an efflux of plant electrolytes was found to be associated with the interactions between p. solanacearum and both tomato and tobacco leaves. this phenomenon may be part of the mechanism by which  hrp gene products control and determine plant-bacterial interactions, since hrpo  mutants induced levels of leakage which were significantly lower than those induced by the wild type on each plant.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of polygalacturonic acid by yersinia and klebsiella species in relation to clinical laboratory procedures.
AB  == as scored by several specified plating procedures, clinical and environmental strains of yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and klebsiella pneumoniae "oxytocum" showed detectable, albeit generally weak, ability to digest polygalacturonic (pectic) acid. none of these bacterial strains had the vigorous  and rapid pectolytic activity on these polygalacturonic acid-containing media that is typical of soft-rot erwinia species, although some of the oxytocum strains came fairly close. analyses of the pectolytic enzyme contents of the cells and culture supernatants of the yersinia and klebsiella species revealed that readily detectable quantities of cell-bound polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase and hydrolytic polygalacturonase were formed by the yersinia and  klebsiella species; however, the total units of enzyme activity produced by these bacteria were, in general, lower than were produced by soft-rot erwinia species.  furthermore, unlike the situation in soft-rot erwinia cultures, these pectolytic  enzymes of yersinia and klebsiella species were not excreted rapidly and massively into the growth medium. cultures of other enterobacteria (citrobacter species, enterobacter species, erwinia amylovora, erwinia herbicola, escherichia  coli, proteus species, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens) showed no pectolytic ability whatsoever by any of the plating procedures used and (to the extent they were so examined) produced no pectolytic enzymes detectable either in their cells or culture supernatants. this slow or weak release of pectolytic enzymes by yersinia and klebsiella species has a bearing on clinical laboratory procedures suitable for detecting their pectolytic activity; methods adequate for this purpose are detailed.
