TI  == comparison of phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the objective of this work is to compare the phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis. the bacterial examination of 50 livers of individual broilers, marketed by four major outlets,  revealed a high recovery of p. mirabilis (66%), and a low recovery frequency of salmonella spp. (4%), serratia odorifera (2%), citrobacter brakii (2%), and providencia stuartii (2%). the phenotypic biochemical characterization of the recovered 33 chicken isolates of p. mirabilis were compared to 30 human isolates  (23 urinary and six respiratory isolates). the comparison revealed significant differences in the presence of gelatinase enzyme (100% presence in chicken isolates versus 91.3 and 83.3% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the h(2)s production occurred in 100% of chicken isolates versus 95.6 and 66.7% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the other 17 biochemical characteristics did not differ significantly among the three groups of isolates (p.0.05). two virulence genes, the mrpa and flil, were having a typical 100% presence in randomly selected isolates of p. mirabilis recovered from chicken livers (n510) versus isolates recovered from urinary (n55) and respiratory specimens of humans (n55) (p.0.05). the average percentage similarity of mrpa gene nucleotide sequence of poultry isolates to human urinary and respiratory isolates was 93.2 and 97.5-%, respectively. the high similarity in phenotypic characteristics, associated with  typical frequency of presence of two virulence genes, and high similarity in sequences of mrpa gene among poultry versus human p. mirabilis isolates justifies future investigations targeting the evaluation of adaptable pathogenicity of avian proteus mirabilis isolates to mammalian hosts.

TI  == degradation of raw or film-incorporated beta-cyclodextrin by enzymes and colonic  bacteria.
AB  == beta-cyclodextrin (beta-cd) is a suitable excipient for peroral use, which improves the solubility of lipophilic drugs, as well as for colon-specific drug release when it is mixed with coating polymers. the first aim of this work was to examine the suitability of various enzymes as a simple in vitro model for the glycolytic activity in the human colon. alpha-amylase (source aspergillus oryzae) and taka diastase (source a. oryzae) showed remarkable degradation capacity of free beta-cd, whereas other alpha-amylases (sources bacillus subtilis or hog pancreas) were found to be unsuitable. the next aim was to find out if film-incorporated beta-cd is also degraded by these enzymes. therefore, diffusion studies of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) through eudragit rs or eudragit ne films containing beta-cd were performed with taka diastase present in the buffer medium. pronounced diffusion of the drug through the eudragit rs film was found only when swelling excipients like crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cmc-cl sodium) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp 25) were present in the film, indicating enhanced accessibility of beta-cd by the enzyme. films containing cmc-cl without beta-cd showed even higher permeability, which also points to enzymatic degradation of cmc-cl. permeabilization by taka diastase of eudragit ne films without swelling agents correlated with the beta-cd content, whereas control films containing talcum remained impermeable upon enzyme action. furthermore, the beta-cd degradation capacity of colonic bacteria like escherichia fergusonii, serratia odorifera or proteus mirabilis was examined with beta-cd coatings on tablets, which contained bisoprolol as a model drug. tablets  with beta-cd-containing eudragit rs coatings showed the highest drug release upon incubation with p. mirabilis. the moderate drug release by e. fergusonii could be increased almost to the same level when the bacteria were pre-incubated for 24 h  in medium containing 2.5 mg/ml beta-cd, indicating the induction of glycolytic enzymes by beta-cd in this colonic bacteria strain.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
