TI  - Treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: To examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (AOM), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. METHODS: During this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and LC705, Bifidobacterium breve 99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. Clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. Parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI) in a diary. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, OR=1.48, 95% CI 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of AOM episodes (18% vs. 17%, OR=1.04, 95% CI 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). The median duration of AOM episodes was 5.6 (IQR 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (IQR 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). There was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (OR for 4 URIs: 0.56, 95%CI 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; OR for 6 URIs: 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). Probiotics did not affect the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of Moraxella catarrhalis (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of AOM or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. A tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
