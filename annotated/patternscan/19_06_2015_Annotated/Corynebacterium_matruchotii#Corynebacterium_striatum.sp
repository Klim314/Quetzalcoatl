TI  == [antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria isolated from the reproductive tract of women].
AB  == the species composition, antilysozyme activity and antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria, isolated from the reproductive tract of women with microecological disturbances, were studied. sixty six women without microecological disturbances and 102 female patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract were examined. the study showed that corynebacterium minutissimum, c. amycolatum, c. group jk, c. bovis and c. pseudodiphtheriticum prevailed in the healthy women. in the patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract c. vitarumen, c. matruchotii, c. striatum, c. renale and c. urealyticum were detected in addition  to the above species. the average antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria isolated from the healthy women was 1.32 +/- 0.47. in the patients with  microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract it was 1.84 +/- 0.38. the  in vitro susceptibility of the coryneform bacteria to antimicrobial agents was determined. high prevalence of resistance to beta-lactams (oxacillin and penicillin), erythromycin and co-trimoxazole was detected. thus, the species variety and the antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria in the reproductive tract of the women with microecological disturbances were found to be higher. the high prevalence of resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole in the coryneform bacteria isolated from the patients with the microecological disturbances did not differ from that in the healthy women.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  == cellular fatty acid (cfa) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees c. the organisms could be divided into two groups. in the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform cdc groups a-3, a-4, and a-5; some strains of b-1 and b-3; "corynebacterium aquaticum"; brevibacterium liquefaciens; rothia dentocariosa; and listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (ca17:0) acids. other species with these types  of cfa included b. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (ca13:0) acids. cfas useful for distinguishing among jonesia denitrificans, oerskovia spp., some strains of cdc groups b-1 and b-3, kurthia spp., and propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (c 16:0) acid,  isopentadecanoic (ci15:0) acid, and ca15:0). the second group (straight-chained type), which included actinomyces pyogenes; arcanobacterium haemolyticum; c. bovis; c. cystitidis; c. diphtheriae; c. flavescens, "c. gentalium"; c. jeikeium; c. kutscheri; c. matruchotii; c .minutissimum; c. mycetoides; c. pilosum; c. pseudodiphtheriticum; "c. pseudogenitalium"; c. pseudotuberculosis; c. renale; cdc groups 1, 2, anf-1, d-2, e, f-1, f-2, g-1, g-2, and i-2; c. striatum; "c. tuberculostearicum"; c. ulcerans; c. vitarumen; c. xerosis; and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (c16:0) and oleic acids (c18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (c18:2), stearic acid (c18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. cfa composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.
