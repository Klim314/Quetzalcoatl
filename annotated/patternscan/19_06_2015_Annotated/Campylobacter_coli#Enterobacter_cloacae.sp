TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == [gut translocation septicemia in infant].
AB  == intestinal microbiotype necessary for life is a source of complications in childhood. bacterial translocation is responsible of endogenous septicaemia and invasive complications. we report five cases of severe invasive infections associated with diarrhoea, digestive bleeding or sepsis. biological parameters for inflammation are highly positive, and blood cultures reveal bacterial identification: salmonella enteridis, enterobacter cloacae, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli or clostridium difficile. we describe the predisposing factors and susceptibility status to develop translocation: invasive diarrhoea, asplenia, gasto-intestinal disease... all invasive infections in children require etiological approach with the possibility of an endogenous septicaemia (bacterial translocation). this approach minimises the nosocomial features undercurrent in these invasive infections, and leads also to other alternative preventive measures: antibiotic association, maintaining an enteral nutrition, pre or probiotic use, specific digestive decontamination.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  == 'enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain salmonella serotypes, notably: salmonella typhi, a gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, salmonella paratyphi a, b and c. in addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". brucella sp., campylobacter sp., edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia alcalifaciens, pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens, francisella sp. and yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of citrobacter to be reported  presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in thailand.

TI  == [bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study].
AB  == bact-alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. first argentine multicentre study. between january and december 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the bact-alert system (14,960 fan aerobics, 3,855 fan anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 fan pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of buenos aires city, one of la plata city and three  of the buenos aires province. a total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; enterococcus faecalis 1; streptococcus pneumoniae 2; campylobacter spp 1; escherichia coli 1; enterobacter cloacae 1; enterobacteraerogenes 1; citrobacter freundii 1; klebsiella pneumoniae 1; proteus mirabilis 1; serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of  cryptococcus neoformans). of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the  anaerobic standard (65% were propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the fan aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by fan pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and  1.4% by fan anaerobic bottle. our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the bact-alert system is unnecessary.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. the ph decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the od of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. the counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. the antimicrobial activity of kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. staphylococcus aureus, shigella sonnei, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, helicobacterpylori, and listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to kombucha. according to the literature on kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and  this is also valid in the present study. however, in this study, kombucha proved  to exert antimicrobial activities against e. coli, sh. sonnei, sal. typhimurium,  sal. enteritidis, and cm. jejuni, even at neutral ph and after thermal denaturation. this finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in kombucha.

TI  == investigation of helicobacter pylori ascorbic acid oxidating activity.
AB  == helicobacter pylori sonicate was shown to oxidize ascorbic acid. ascorbic acid oxidation was determined by chromatography combined with electrochemical detection. water soluble ascorbic acid oxidase activity was rather independent of ph with a ph optimum around 2. by gel filtration the oxidizing activity co-eluted with an absorbency peak at 408 nm. the relative molecular mass (mr) was approximately 14,000. it is suggested that this oxidating activity was caused by  a cytochrome c-like molecule. ascorbic acid oxidating activity could also be extracted from bacterial membranes by detergents. gel filtration showed several forms, the major one with a mr = 19,000. ph optimum was 6-7. other oxidase-positive bacterial strains like campylobacter coli, enterobacter cloacae  and pseudomonas aeruginosa could degrade ascorbic acid. since ascorbic acid oxidation by helicobacter pylori whole bacterial lysates has a ph optimum in the  acidic range corresponding to ph in gastric fluid, the activity of the cytochrome c-like water soluble oxidant of helicobacter pylori seems to be primarily important for the destruction of ascorbic acid in the gastric juice of infected patients.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
