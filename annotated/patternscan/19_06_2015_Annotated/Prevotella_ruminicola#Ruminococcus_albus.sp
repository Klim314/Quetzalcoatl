TI  == study of rumen metagenome community using qpcr under different diets.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the major bacteria present in rumen microbiota. here, we performed qpcr based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to roughage diets. animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 100:00 (t1), 75:25 (t2), 50:50 (t3) and 25:75 (t4) respectively for 30 days. at the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h and 2 h after feeding. it was found that among fibrolytic bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.22 x 10(8) copies/ml) were highest in t2 group and followed by 1.11 x 10(8) copies/ml for fibrobacter succinogenes (t2), 2.56 x 10(7) copies/ml for prevotella ruminicola (t1) and 1.25 x 10(7) copies/ml for ruminococcus albus (t4). in non-fibrolytic bacteria, the selenomonas ruminantium  (2.62 x 10(7) copies/ml) was predominant in group t3 and followed by treponema bryantii (2.52 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1, ruminobacter amylophilus (1.31 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1 and anaerovibrio lipolytica (2.58 x 10(6) copies/ml)  in group t4. it is most notable that r. flavefaciens were the highest in population in the rumen of surti buffalo fed wheat straw as roughage source.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) from nujiang  region, china.
AB  == the rumen content of four yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 otu (operational taxonomy unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. similarity analysis revealed that yunnan yellow cattle had 12 sequences (10 otu) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succiniclasticum ruminis, ruminococcus bromii, clostridium proteoclasticum, ruminococcus flavefaciens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total otu). the further 12 sequences (9 otu) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, schwartzia succinivorans, prevotella ruminicola, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus albus, and clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of  the total otu). the remaining 105 sequences (90 otu) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total otu). according to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low g+c subdivision (accounting for  72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively) and cfb subdivision (cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively). among the examined clones, rare bacteria jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  == high concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. the ability of 22 strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (ruminococcus albus sy3, ruminococcus flavefaciens rf1,prevotella ruminicola ar20) and the ruminal phycomycete neocallimastix patriciarum cx to digest the tropical grass heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the b. fibrisolvens strains h17c, a38, lp92-1-1, 49,r. albus sy3 and n. patriciarum. hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except b. fibrisolvens strains gs113, ob156 and lp1028 and p. ruminicola ar20. the ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different  strains of butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for ar 51 to 0.16 for a38. butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (h17c and a38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (lp 91-4-1 and ar 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when butyrivibrio spp. strains h17c, a38 and e14 and the ruminococcus spp. were grown  on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with n. patriciarum. this is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus ruminococcus. the fungus n. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. the study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == real-time pcr detection of the effects of protozoa on rumen bacteria in cattle.
AB  == a real-time pcr approach was used in this study to clarify the populations of major bacterial species in the rumens of faunated and unfaunated cattle. the sensitivity of this novel real-time pcr assay was evaluated by using 10(1) to 10(8) plasmid copies of target bacteria. the numbers of plasmid copies of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella ruminicola, and the cur-e cluster were higher in the unfaunated than in the faunated rumens. the cur-e cluster belongs to the clostridium group. in contrast, fibrobacter succinogenes was higher in the faunated than in the unfaunated rumens. although it is well known that an absence of protozoa brings about an increase in the bacterial population, it was clarified here that an absence of protozoa exerted differential effects on the populations of cellulolytic bacteria in cattle rumens (i.e., f. succinogenes, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens). in addition, real-time pcr analysis suggested that the cur-e cluster was more prevalent in the unfaunated rumens.

TI  == activity and properties of fumarate reductase in ruminal bacteria.
AB  == fumarate-reducing bacteria were sought from the main ruminal bacteria. fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium subsp. ruminantium, selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica, and veillonella parvula reduced fumarate by using h(2) as an electron donor. ruminococcus albus, prevotella ruminicola, and anaerovibrio lipolytica consumed fumarate, although they did not oxidize h(2). of these bacteria, v. parvula, two strains of selenomonas, and f. succinogenes had a high capacity to reduce fumarate. in all the fumarate-reducing bacteria examined, fumarate reductase existed in the membrane fraction. based on the activity per cell mass and the affinity of fumarate reductase to fumarate, these bacteria were divided into two groups, which corresponded to the capacity to use h(2): a group  of bacteria with higher activity and affinity were able to use h(2) as an electron donor for fumarate reduction. the bacteria in this group should gain an  advantage over the bacteria in another group in fumarate reduction in the rumen.  cellulose digestion by r. albus was improved by fumarate reduction by s. lactilytica as a result of an increased growth of r. albus, which may have been caused by the fact that s. lactilytica immediately consumed h(2) produced by r. albus. thus fumarate reduction may play an important role in keeping a low partial pressure of h(2) in the rumen.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == microbial perspective on fiber utilization by swine.
AB  == dietary fiber may contribute up to 30% of the maintenance energy needs of growing pigs. higher energy contributions may be obtained from dietary fiber fed to sows, along with some improvements in reproduction, health, and well-being. as long as  cereal grain supplies and high-quality protein supplements are abundant, the use  of fibrous feeds for swine most likely will be limited. however, as the human demand for cereal grains increases, swine producers, especially those with reproductive animals, may be economically forced to incorporate alternative feedstuffs. these feedstuffs might include lignified plant cell wall material such as grasses and legumes, and feed-milling and distillery by-products that contain a high level of fiber residues. the microflora in swine large intestine will be able to adapt to these lignified forages and by-product feeds much better than the microflora in humans. swine microflora contain highly active ruminal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacterial species, which include fibrobacter succinogenes (intestinalis), ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio spp., and prevotella ruminicola. additionally, a new highly active cellulolytic bacterium, clostridium herbivorans, has been recently isolated from  pig large intestine. the populations of these microorganisms are known to increase in response to the ingestion of diets high in plant cell wall material.  the numbers of cellulolytic bacteria from adult animals are approximately 6.7 times greater than those found in growing pigs. none of these highly active cellulolytic bacterial species are found in the human large intestine. thus, the  pig large intestinal fermentation of fiber seems to more closely resemble that of ruminants than that of humans.

TI  == utilization of xylooligosaccharides by selected ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the ability of ruminal bacteria to utilize xylooligosaccharides was examined. xylooligosaccharides were prepared by partially hydrolyzing oat spelt xylan in phosphoric acid. this substrate solution was added (0.2%, wt/vol) to a complex medium containing yeast extract and trypticase that was inoculated with individual species of ruminal bacteria, and growth and utilization were monitored over time. all of the xylanolytic bacteria examined were able to utilize this oligosaccharide mixture as a growth substrate. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium ruminantium, and ruminococcus albus used xylooligosaccharides and whole, unhydrolyzed xylan to similar extents, while prevotella ruminicola used twice as much xylooligosaccharides as xylan (76 versus 34%). strains of selenomonas ruminantium were the only nonxylanolytic species that were able to grow on xylooligosaccharides. the ability of individual s. ruminantium strains to utilize xylooligosaccharides was correlated with the presence of xylosidase and arabinosidases activities.

TI  == interactions between proteolytic and cellulolytic rumen bacteria during hydrolysis of plant cell wall protein.
AB  == during the degradation of the plant cell wall protein of dried alfalfa, interactions may occur between hydrolytic activities of cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus or fibrobacter succinogenes) and proteolytic (prevotella ruminicola or butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) bacteria. in vitro the hydrolysis of these protein compounds begins after the depolymerization of the cell wall polysaccharides has started. maximal degradation of cell wall protein of dried alfalfa (37.2%) was obtained with cocultures of prevotella ruminicola and ruminococcus albus.
