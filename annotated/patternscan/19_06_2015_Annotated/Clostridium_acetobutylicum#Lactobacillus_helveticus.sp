TI  == a general method for cloning reca genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == an internal fragment of the reca gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. the internal 348- or 360-bp reca dna segments from bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, leuconostoc mesanteroides, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the g + c contents of the dna from these species range from 28 to 52%. the sequences of the bacterial reca genes show strong relatedness. this method is particularly useful  for the recovery of the reca genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.
