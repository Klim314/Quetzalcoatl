TI  == role of metal resistant plant growth promoting bacteria in ameliorating fly ash to the growth of brassica juncea.
AB  == in this study, we have shown that the plant growth promoting bacterial strain nbri k24 and strain nbri k3 from fly ash (fa) contaminated soil reduce the toxicity of ni and cr in brassica juncea (indian mustard) and promote plant growth under pot culture experiments. isolated strains nbri k24 and nbri k3 were  characterized based on the 16s rdna sequencing and identified as enterobacter aerogenes and rahnella aquatilis respectively. both the strains were siderophore  producing and found capable of stimulating plant biomass and enhance phytoextraction of metals (ni and cr) from fa by metal accumulating plant i.e. b. juncea. concurrent production of siderophores, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc) deaminase, indole acetic acid (iaa) and phosphate solubilization revealed their plant growth promotion potential.

TI  == dna based classification of food associated enterobacteriaceae previously identified by biolog gn microplates.
AB  == enterobacteriaceae are frequently isolated from food products and it is essential to have methods for correct identification for both food hygiene and epidemiology reasons. phenotypic methods are not always sufficient and have to be supplemented by dna based methods. in the present study, 70 strains of enterobacteriaceae derived from milk, fish and meat that had previously been identified by biolog gn microplates were genomically classified together with 15 representative type strains of species of enterobacteriaceae. the field strains were dominated by hafnia alvei, serratia liquefaciens and rahnella aquatilis. all strains were subjected to temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) analysis using amplicons encompassing the v3, v4 and v9 variable regions of the 16s rrna gene. selected strains were analysed by ribotyping and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the type strains were differentiated into 10 different ttge groups. two of the groups contained two type strains. enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella planticola were not distinguished due to their identical sequences and yersinia ruckeri and citrobacter freundii showed the same migration pattern. the 70 food strains could be differentiated into 14 ttge groups where 33 strains (47.1%) could be assigned  to ttge groups including type or reference strains. rahnella strains were dispersed into three ttge groups of which one group corresponded to rahnella genomospecies 1 and one to genomospecies 3. the grouping of rahnella strains was  supported by ribotyping and phylogenetic analysis. ttge can be a useful additional tool for identification on the species level of food related enterobacteriaceae.
