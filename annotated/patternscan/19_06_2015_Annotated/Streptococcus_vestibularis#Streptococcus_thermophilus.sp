TI  == genomics of streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  == the salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. this group consists of three genetically similar species, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus thermophilus. s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas s. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in  dairy production. we developed multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and comparative  genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. these analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of s. salivarius sensu stricto. s. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. by  contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. the species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7mb for s. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3mb for s. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for s. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of s. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. however, although the s. salivarius strains  studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (crisprs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.
AB  == numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. crispr structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. in silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with crispr structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1b, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. sequence analysis of crispr structures from 24 strains of streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. phage sensitivity of s. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the crispr locus the strain carries. the authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign dna expression, by coding an anti-sense rna. the presence of gene fragments in crispr structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that crispr formation involves a dna degradation step.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) for identification of streptococcus species.
AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
