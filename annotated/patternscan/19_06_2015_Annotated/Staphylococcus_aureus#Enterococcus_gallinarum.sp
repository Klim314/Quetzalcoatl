TI  == bioprotective potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococcus gallinarum strains isolated from some nigerian fermented foods, and of their bacteriocins.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strains isolated from some nigerian fermented foods were  found to produce bacteriocins. the bacteriocins had a broad spectrum of activity  against both gram-positive and negative bacteria. the effects of the bacteriocins and bacteriocinogenic organ- isms on staphylococcus aureus infections in rats were evaluated. sprague-dawley rats were infected with s. aureus mtcc 737 and treated with e. gallinarum t71 and different concentrations of the bacteriocins from e. gallinarum w211 and t71. staphylococcus aureus infection caused significant upregulation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in sera of the infected rats. moreover, gelatin zymography revealed that infected gastric tissues showed elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. bacteriocin treatments reduced the mmp-9 activity and inhibited the expressions of both tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) dose dependently, pointing to a potential role  of the bacteriocins in attenuating inflammatory responses to staphylococcus aureus infec- tion. gastric and git damage caused by staphylococcal infection were reduced in the enterococcus gallinarum t71 and bacteriocin-treated groups also dose dependently. we conclude that these bacteriocins may have useful biomedical applications.

TI  == glucose triggers atp secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == objectives: to determine the trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci between the hospital and community as well as the occurrence of co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). subjects and methods: from november  2005 to april 2006, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcons)-positive patients at the salmaniya medical complex, bahrain were assessed for vre co-colonization. characterization of vancomycin resistance genotype by pcr was carried out. close family contacts were screened for mrsa and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis of mrsa isolates from patient-family member pairs was conducted. results: one hundred and eighty-two patients (93 mrsa; 89 mrcons)  and 356 family members were enrolled. seven mrsa and 41 mrcons strains were isolated from the family members. pfge analysis revealed the presence of variants of a single mrsa clone among patients and their relatives. a total of 112 patients (62 mrsa; 50 mrcons) provided stool for vre screening. of these 13 stool specimens (11.6%) were vre-positive. all the vre isolates were from mrsa-positive patients, thus positivity rate among mrsa patients was 20.9% (n/n = 13/62). these were predominantly enterococcus gallinarum with vanc1 genotype and one strain was enterococcus faecium (vanb genotype). two e. gallinarum isolates harbored an additional vanb gene. the majority of vre isolates were from patients in medical  and surgical units (n/n = 10/13; 77%). male gender, prolonged hospitalization and presence of co-morbidities were significantly associated with mrsa/vre co-colonization (p < 0.05). conclusion: mrsa/vre co-colonization with mrsa trafficking between the hospital and community environment is a public health concern occurring in our setting.

TI  == aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (gp-bsi(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. between october 2000 and september 2006, 42 episodes of gp-bsi(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, enterococcus species in 42.9% (e faecalis, eight; e faecium, seven; e avium, two; e gallinarum, one) and staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for gp-bsi (odds ratio [or], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.089 to 0.715; p = .009). thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and s aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. it is noteworthy that all the isolates of s aureus were methicillin-resistant. ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of e faecium and 50% of e avium isolates, but active against all e faecalis and e gallinarum strains. all the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. no significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. gp-bsi, the only independent risk factor for death (or, 0.262; 95% ci, 0.106 to 0.643; p = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first  year posttransplant. in conclusion, gp-bsi(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. control measures are required to reduce the incidence of gp-bsi(s) in liver transplant recipients. these findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.

TI  == granular layer in the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria and fine structures of enterococcus gallinarum and streptococcus gordonii septa revealed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections.
AB  == high-resolution structural information on optimally preserved bacterial cells can be obtained with cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. with the help of  this technique, the existence of a periplasmic space between the plasma membrane  and the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus was recently shown. this raises questions about the mode of polymerization of peptidoglycan. in the present study, we report the structure of the cell envelope of three gram-positive bacteria (b. subtilis, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus gallinarum). in the three cases, a previously undescribed granular layer adjacent to the plasma membrane is found in the periplasmic space. in order to better understand how nascent peptidoglycan is incorporated into the mature peptidoglycan, we investigated cellular regions known to represent the sites of cell wall production. each of these sites possesses a specific structure. we propose a hypothetic model of peptidoglycan polymerization that accommodates these differences: peptidoglycan precursors could be exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space, where they could diffuse until they would interact with the interface between the granular layer and the thick peptidoglycan layer. they could then polymerize with mature peptidoglycan. we report cytoplasmic structures at the e. gallinarum septum that  could be interpreted as cytoskeletal elements driving cell division (ftsz ring).  although immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy studies have demonstrated the septal and cytoplasmic localization of ftsz, direct visualization of in situ ftsz filaments has not been obtained in any electron microscopy study of fixed and dehydrated bacteria.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == [susceptibilities of enterococcus faecium, prsp and mrsa to rp59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

TI  == comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, e-test, disk diffusion, and automated vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  == an evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the synergy quad plate (remel, lenexa, kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (bhi) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared mueller-hinton (mh) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (sensititre just one strip; accumed international, inc., west lake, ohio) with bhi or cation-adjusted mh broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (e test; ab biodisk, solna, sweden) with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or  48 h; and the automated vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility staphylococcus aureus card and r02.03 software (biomerieux, inc., hazelwood, mo.). growth failures occurred with mh media (n = 6) but not with bhi media. one  growth failure occurred with the vitek method. results for each testing method for each enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2/3). for all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. the following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with bhi media incubated for 24 h, agar  dilution with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and e test with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h. unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which mh media were used. minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. these minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with enterococcus strains with vanc genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (mic < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to enterococcus strains which possessed vana or vanb genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (mic > or = 64 microg/ml). modification of nccls breakpoints, especially for motile enterococcus spp. (e. casseliflavus, e.  flavescens, and e. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one e. faecalis strain and one e. faecium strain carried only the vanc gene. the agar screen method may also require reformulation. the current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanc genotypes. nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == characteristics of enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the crop and caecum of japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions.
AB  == ten selected strains of enterococci and staphylococci were isolated from the crop and caecum of japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions. isolates were allotted to the species enterococcus gallinarum, ent. avium, ent. faecium, staphylococcus gallinarum and staph. aureus. isolated strains were facultatively  anaerobic, non-motile, gram-positive cocci, occurring in pairs, short chains or irregular clusters. isolates utilized most of the soluble sugars tested and produced bacteriocin-like substances. enterococci and staphylococci were resistant to monensin (50 mg/l) and sensitive to tylosin and virginiamycin (10 mg/l).

TI  == [determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the e-test method].
AB  == e-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 e. facalis and 1 e. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate e. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible e. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 s. aureus, 1 s. epidermidis and 2 s. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 s. epidermidis, 2 s. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 s. aureus, 1 s. epidermidis and 1 s. hominis). repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the  case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. e-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.

TI  == occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. type a (high-level) resistance was described in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. it is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. type b (low-level) resistance described in e. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of  a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. type c resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to e. gallinarum. among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. they produce an approximately 39-kda cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. the era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.

TI  == [the effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  == some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. staphylococcus cohnii sc7, staphylococcus sp. ztj 151, s. saprophyticus ss 877, enterococcus faecium ef1 and e. faecalis efg2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves  and fallow deer, enterococcus gallinarum eg10 and e. avium ea12 were isolated from the caecum of japanese quail. the tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and  urease activity (tab. iii). these culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and vl agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (zag, zal, vlg, vll), agar for isolation  of faecal streptococci (sa) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (ka4, ka2). the strains streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and staphylococcus aureus oxford 209 p were used as indicator bacteria. tables i and ii show the results of these  tests. the tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on sa medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. on zag medium, the zones of enterococci with the ao 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. all strains with the 209p indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. the larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the zal medium with the ao24/85 strain. the production of tested strains was balanced on vlg agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
