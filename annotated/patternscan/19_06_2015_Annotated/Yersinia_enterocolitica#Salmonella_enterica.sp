TI  == protozoan cysts act as survival niche and protective shelter for foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the production of cysts, an integral part of the life cycle of many free-living protozoa, allows these organisms to survive adverse environmental conditions. given the prevalence of free-living protozoa in food-related environments, it is  hypothesized that these organisms play an important, yet currently underinvestigated role in the epidemiology of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. intracystic bacterial survival is highly relevant, as this would allow bacteria to survive the stringent cleaning and disinfection measures applied in food-related environments. the present study shows that strains of widespread and important foodborne bacteria (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and listeria monocytogenes) survive inside cysts of the ubiquitous amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii, even when exposed to either antibiotic treatment (100 mug/ml gentamycin) or to highly acidic conditions (ph 0.2) and resume active growth in broth media following excystment. strain- and species-specific differences in survival period were observed, with salmonella enterica surviving up to three weeks inside amoebal cysts. up to 53% of the cysts were infected with pathogenic bacteria, which were located in the cyst cytosol. our study suggests that the role of free-living protozoa and especially their cysts in the persistence and epidemiology of foodborne bacterial pathogens in food-related environments may be much more important than hitherto assumed.

TI  == activity of a bacterial cell envelope stress response is controlled by the interaction of a protein binding domain with different partners.
AB  == the bacterial phage shock protein (psp) system is a highly conserved cell envelope stress response required for virulence in yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica. in non-inducing conditions the transcription factor pspf is  inhibited by an interaction with pspa. in contrast, pspa associates with the cytoplasmic membrane proteins pspbc during inducing conditions. this has led to the proposal that pspbc exists in an off state, which cannot recruit pspa, or an  on state, which can. however, nothing was known about the difference between these two states. here, we provide evidence that it is the c-terminal domain of y. enterocolitica pspc (pspc(ct)) that interacts directly with pspa, both in vivo and in vitro. site-specific photocross-linking revealed that this interaction occurred only during psp-inducing conditions in vivo. importantly, we have also discovered that pspc(ct) can interact with the c-terminal domain of pspb (pspc(ct).pspb(ct)). however, the pspc(ct).pspb(ct) and pspc(ct).pspa interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro. furthermore, in vivo, pspc(ct) contacted pspb(ct) in the off state, whereas it contacted pspa in the on state. these findings provide the first description of the previously proposed pspbc off and on states and reveal that the regulatory switch is centered on a pspc(ct) partner-switching mechanism.

TI  == the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
AB  == propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and  the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == flagellin-induced nlrc4 phosphorylation primes the inflammasome for activation by naip5.
AB  == the nlrc4 inflammasome contributes to immunity against intracellular pathogens that express flagellin and type iii secretion systems, and activating mutations in nlrc4 cause autoinflammation in patients. both naip5 and phosphorylation of nlrc4 at ser533 are required for flagellin-induced inflammasome activation, but how these events converge upon inflammasome activation is not known. here, we showed that nlrc4 phosphorylation occurs independently of naip5 detection of flagellin because naip5 deletion in macrophages abolished caspase-1 activation, interleukin (il)-1beta secretion, and pyroptosis, but not nlrc4 phosphorylation by cytosolic flagellin of salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica. asc speck formation and caspase-1 expression also were dispensable for nlrc4 phosphorylation. interestingly, helicobacter pylori flagellin triggered robust nlrc4 phosphorylation, but failed to elicit caspase-1 maturation, il-1beta secretion, and pyroptosis, suggesting that it retained nlrc4 ser533 phosphorylating-activity despite escaping naip5 detection. in agreement, the flagellin d0 domain was required and sufficient for nlrc4 phosphorylation, whereas deletion of the s. typhimurium flagellin carboxy-terminus prevented caspase-1 maturation only. collectively, this work suggests a biphasic activation mechanism for the nlrc4 inflammasome in which ser533 phosphorylation prepares nlrc4 for subsequent activation by the flagellin sensor naip5.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from schiff bases of zein.
AB  == pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. in an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, chemical modification of zein through forming schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. the chemical structure of the schiff bases films were characterized by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. an increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). an increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. as shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. surface topography also varied by forming schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. the antibacterial activities of zein and schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica). it was found that the antibacterial activity of the schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.

TI  == pathogenic enterobacteria in lemurs associated with anthropogenic disturbance.
AB  == as human population density continues to increase exponentially, speeding the reduction and fragmentation of primate habitat, greater human-primate contact is  inevitable, making higher rates of pathogen transmission likely. anthropogenic effects are particularly evident in madagascar, where a diversity of endemic lemur species are threatened by rapid habitat loss. despite these risks, knowledge of how anthropogenic activities affect lemur exposure to pathogens is limited. to improve our understanding of this interplay, we non-invasively examined six species of wild lemurs in ranomafana national park for enteric bacterial pathogens commonly associated with diarrheal disease in human populations in madagascar. patterns of infection with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, and yersinia spp. (enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis) were compared between lemurs inhabiting intact forest and lemurs inhabiting degraded habitat with frequent exposure to tourism and other human activity. fecal samples acquired from humans, livestock,  and rodents living near the degraded habitat were also screened for these bacteria. remarkably, only lemurs living in disturbed areas of the park tested positive for these pathogens. moreover, all of these pathogens were present in the human, livestock, and/or rodent populations. these data suggest that lemurs residing in forests altered or frequented by people, livestock, or peridomestic rodents, are at risk for infection by these diarrhea-causing enterobacteria and other similarly transmitted pathogens.

TI  == epidemiology of pathogenic enterobacteria in humans, livestock, and peridomestic  rodents in rural madagascar.
AB  == background: among the families of enteric bacteria are globally important diarrheal agents. despite their potential for zoonotic and environmental transmission, few studies have examined the epidemiology of these pathogens in rural systems characterized by extensive overlap among humans, domesticated and peridomestic animals. we investigated patterns of infection with enterotoxigenic  escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, and yersinia spp. (enterocolitica, and pseudotuberculosis) in southeastern madagascar where the potential for the aforementioned interactions is high. in this pilot project we conducted surveys to examine behaviors potentially associated with risk of infection and if infection with specific enterobacteria species was associated with diarrheal disease. methodology/principal findings: pcr was conducted on dna from human, livestock, and rodent fecal samples from three villages. overall, human prevalence was highest (77%), followed by rodents (51%)  and livestock (18%). rodents were approximately 2.8 times more likely than livestock to carry one of the bacteria. the incidence of individual species varied between villages, with the observation that, e. coli and shigella spp. were consistently associated with co-infections. as an aggregate, there was a significant risk of infection linked to a water source in one village. individually, different pathogens were associated with certain behaviors, including: those who had used medication, experienced diarrhea in the past four weeks, or do not use toilets. conclusions/significance: different bacteria were associated with an elevated risk of infection for various human activities or characteristics. certain bacteria may also predispose people to co-infections. these data suggest that a high potential for transmission among these groups, either directly or via contaminated water sources. as these bacteria were most prevalent in humans, it is possible that they are maintained in humans and that transmission to other species is infrequent. further studies are needed to understand bacterial persistence, transmission dynamics, and associated consequences in this and similar systems.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == [sensitivity of three inmunocromathographic tests in faeces samples for campylobacter and salmonella detection in comparison to culture].
AB  == introduction: campylobacter sp. and salmonella enterica are two of the main organisms causing gastroenteritis in our environment. immunochromatographic tests for antigen detection performed directly on stool samples for its simplicity and  rapid results may make them useful diagnostic elements in the context of primary  care. method: during october 2012 we selected all feces in which enteropathogenic bacteria are isolated from those received for stool culture in the laboratory of  microbiology of the university hospital virgen de las nieves of granada. after standard management of faeces samples and isolation of any enteropathogen, the commercial kits: campy leti, ridaquick campylobacterscreen and salmonella leti were tested for simultaneous research of campylobacter and salmonella antigens. sensitivity and specificity were determined. results: two hundred and thirty five stool samples were received in which 8 salmonella enterica (7 b serogroup and 1 d serogroup), 7 campylobacter jejuni, 4 aeromonas hydrophila and 1 yersinia enterocolitica were isolated. campy leti, ridaquick campylobacterscreen and salmonella leti presented a sensitivity of 100%, 100% and 75%, respectively. specificities corresponded to 46%, 69% and 100%, respectively. conclusion: immunocromatographic tests can be useful for a first screening of enteropathogen  in primary care.

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  == most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. the list of targets include, among the others, listeria spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., escherichia coli spp., campylobacter spp., clostridium spp. and staphylococcus aureus. the accuracy of detection was determined by using atcc strains as positive and negative controls. the achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic dna, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. the working ranges of the taqman((r)) real-time pcr assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of listeria spp., listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, salmonella enterica, shigella boydii, e. coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter sakazakii and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. no matrix interferences were observed.

TI  == biophysical characterization of the type iii secretion tip proteins and the tip proteins attached to bacterium-like particles.
AB  == bacterium-like particles (blps), derived from lactococcus lactis, offer a self-adjuvanting delivery vehicle for subunit protein vaccines. proteins can be specifically loaded onto the blps via a peptidoglycan anchoring (pa) domain. in this study, the tip proteins ipad, sipd, and lcrv belonging to type iii secretion systems of shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, were fused to the pa and loaded onto the blps. herein, we biophysically characterized these nine samples and condensed the spectroscopic results into three-index empirical phase diagrams (epds). the epds show distinctions between the ipad/sipd and lcrv subfamilies of tip proteins, based on their physical stability, even upon addition of the pa. upon attachment to the blps, the blps become defining moiety in the spectroscopic measurements, leaving  the tip proteins to have a subtle yet modulating effect on the structural integrity of the tip proteins-blps binding. in summary, this work provides a comprehensive view of physical stability of the tip proteins and tip protein-blps and serves as a baseline for screening of excipients to increase the stability of the tip protein-blps for future vaccine formulation.

TI  == green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  == this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated  by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == rabbit monoclonal antibodies directed at the t3ss effector protein yopm identify  human pathogenic yersinia isolates.
AB  == the yersinia outer protein m (yopm) is a type 3 secretion system (t3ss)-dependent effector protein of yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia pestis. although yopm is indispensable for full virulence, its molecular functions still remain largely elusive. recently, we could identify the recombinant yopm (ryopm) protein derived from the y. enterocolitica strain 8081 (jb580) as a cell-penetrating protein, which down-regulates the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnfalpha. in this study, we have generated rabbit monoclonal anti-yopm antibodies (rabmabs). rabmabs were characterized by sds-page and western blotting using various truncated versions of ryopm to identify epitope-containing domains. rabmabs recognizing either the n- or c-terminus of yopm were characterized further and validated using a collection of 61 pathogenic and non-pathogenic yersinia strains as well as exemplary strains of major intestinal bacterial pathogens such as salmonella enterica ssp. enterica, shigella flexneri and intestinal pathogenic escherichia coli. rabmab 41.3 directed at the n-terminus of yopm of y. enterocolitica strain  8081 recognized all yopm-expressing pathogenic yersinia strains analyzed in this  study but failed to recognize non-pathogenic isolates. thus, rabmab 41.3 might be applicable for the detection of pathogenic yersinia strains.

TI  == disease-outcome trees, eq-5d scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (qalys) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the united states.
AB  == measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. they provide a means of  comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. we present detailed disease-outcome trees and eq-5d scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the united states (campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, cryptosporidium parvum, cyclospora cayetanensis, escherichia coli o157:h7, shiga toxin-producing e. coli non-o157, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella, toxoplasma gondii, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera vibrio, and yersinia enterocolitica). we estimate over 5800 qalys lost per 1000 cases of l. monocytogenes and v. vulnificus, compared to 125 qalys lost per 1000 cases of t.  gondii, 26 for e. coli o157:h7, 16 for salmonella and campylobacter, and 14 for y. enterocolitica. the remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 qalys lost per 1000 cases. in total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in qaly loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total qaly loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. these estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research  is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. this study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.

AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test  was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica inhibits salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes cellular uptake.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1b employs two type three secretion systems (t3ss), ysa and ysc, which inject effector proteins into macrophages to prevent phagocytosis. conversely, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium uses a t3ss encoded by salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (spi1) to actively invade cells that are normally nonphagocytic and a second t3ss encoded by spi2 to survive within macrophages. given the distinctly different outcomes that occur with regard to host cell uptake of s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica, we investigated how each pathogen influences the internalization outcome of the other. y. enterocolitica reduces s. typhimurium invasion of hela and caco-2 cells to a level similar to that observed using an s. typhimurium spi1 mutant alone. however, y. enterocolitica had no effect on s. typhimurium uptake by j774.1 or raw264.7 macrophage-like cells. y. enterocolitica was also able to inhibit the invasion of epithelial and macrophage-like cells by listeria monocytogenes. y. enterocolitica mutants lacking either the ysa or ysc t3ss were partially defective, while double mutants were completely defective, in blocking s. typhimurium uptake by epithelial cells. s. typhimurium encodes a luxr homolog, sdia, which detects n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) produced by y. enterocolitica and upregulates the expression of an invasin (rck) and a putative  t3ss effector (srge). two different methods of constitutively activating the s. typhimurium sdia regulon failed to reverse the uptake blockade imposed by y. enterocolitica.

AB  == campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, and yersinia enterocolitica are common causes of foodborne infections in humans with pork as a potential source. monitoring programs at farm level are, to date, only implemented for s. enterica, while epidemiological knowledge of the other two pathogens is still lacking. this study aimed to assess the pathogen load (in the pigs' environment) in fattening pig herds, their simultaneous occurrence, and the occurrence of campylobacter spp. and y. enterocolitica in herds in different salmonella risk categories. in 50 fattening pig herds in northern germany, four pooled fecal samples and 10 swab samples from the pigs' direct environment (pen walls, nipple drinkers), indirect  environment (hallways, drive boards), and flies and rodent droppings were collected from each herd and submitted for cultural examination. campylobacter spp. were detected in 38.1% of fecal, 32.7% of direct environment, 5.3% of indirect environment, and 4.6% of flies/pests samples collected, and y. enterocolitica in 17.1, 8.1, 1.2, and 3.1% and s. enterica in 11.2, 7.7, 4.1, and 1.5%, respectively. for campylobacter spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. enterica, 80, 48, and 32% of herds were positive, respectively; 22 herds were positive for  both campylobacter spp. and y. enterocolitica, 12 for campylobacter spp. and s. enterica, and 7 for y. enterocolitica and s. enterica. there was no significant association between the pathogens at herd level. campylobacter spp. and y. enterocolitica were found more often in samples from the low salmonella risk category (odds ratio, 0.51; confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.73, and 0.3, 0.17 to 0.57), and this was also the case for y. enterocolitica at herd level (odds ratio, 0.08; confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.3). this study provides evidence that the pigs' environment should be accounted for when implementing control measures  on farms against campylobacter spp. and y. enterocolitica. an extrapolation from  the current salmonella monitoring to the other two pathogens does not seem feasible.

TI  == effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in yersinia, proteus, shigella, and salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
AB  == objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial  resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic  bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.

AB  == the influence of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of several chemical poultry decontaminants was assessed. a total of 765 poultry legs were inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, or brochothrix thermosphacta) or gram-negative bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, or pseudomonas fluorescens). samples were dipped for 15 min in solutions (wt/vol) of trisodium phosphate (12%), acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm), citric acid (2%), peroxyacids (220 ppm), chlorine dioxide (50 ppm), or tap water or were left untreated (control). the temperatures of the dipping solutions were 4, 20, or 50  degrees c. microbiological analyses and ph determinations were carried out after  0, 1, 3, and 5 days of storage at 4 degrees c. in comparison with the control samples, all chemical solutions were effective for reducing microbial loads. the  temperature of treatment affected the microbial reductions caused by all chemicals (p < 0.001). the lowest average bacterial reductions caused by trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids were observed at 4 degrees c, all sampling days and microbial groups being considered  simultaneously. the highest and the lowest effectiveness for chlorine dioxide were observed at 4 and 50 degrees c, respectively. these results may be of use to meat processors for selecting the best conditions for decontamination treatments  and may help the european regulatory authorities make their decisions for authorization of poultry decontamination treatments.

TI  == prevalence, characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility of salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter in italy.
AB  == in 2005-2008, 1152 samples (451 faecal samples, 451 carcass swabs and 250 tonsils) were collected from 451 finishing pigs slaughtered in three abattoirs of northern italy. in two abattoirs, 34 scalding water samples were collected. the aim of this study was to investigate the faecal and palatine tonsil carriage rate of salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter and the degree of carcass contamination by these bacteria. typing of the isolates, virulence characterization and antimicrobial testing were also performed. s. enterica was isolated from 21.5% of the faecal samples, 10.9% of the carcasses and 10.4% of the tonsils, but not from scalding water. nineteen different serovars were identified among 172 s. enterica isolates. the prevalent serovars were derby (41.3%), rissen (12.2%), typhimurium (11%), 4,[5],12:i:- (8.7%) and give (4.1%). s. enterica ser. typhimurium and s. enterica ser. 4,[5],12:i:- isolates were phage-typed and pt dt120 was the most common (23.5%). y. enterocolitica was detected in 17.1% of the faecal samples, 2.4% of the carcasses, 10.8% of the tonsils and 11.8% of the scalding water samples. a total  of 119 isolates were found, four of them in water. of the 115 y. enterocolitica isolates of pig origin, 24 (20.9%) were 4/o:3 and 4 (3.5%) were 2/o:9. y. enterocolitica 4/o:3 represented 85.7% of the pathogenic isolates found in all types of samples and 100% of those found in tonsils. in 4/o:3 isolates the most common virulence-associated genes were ysta (100%), inv (95.8%), ail (87.5%) and  yada (54.2%). in 2/o:9 isolates the prevalent genes were ail (100%), inv (100%) and ysta (100%), followed by ystb (25.0%). the majority (75.7%) of y. enterocolitica isolates was biotype 1a, belonging to 13 serotypes (o:3; o:5; o:4,32-4,33; o:6,30-6,31; o:7,8-8; o:7,8-8-8,19; o:7,13; o:8; o:9; o:13; o:16-16,29; o:41,42-41,43; o:52). the most common virulence genes in 1a isolates  were inv (95.4%) and ystb (72.4%). the antimicrobial resistance test showed that  all salmonella isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefalothin, gentamicin and enrofloxacin. resistances to tetracycline (56%), sulphonamide compounds (42%) and streptomycin (34%) were the most common. all y.  enterocolitica isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamicin and neomycin. most isolates were resistant to cefalothin (92%) and ampicillin (89%). apparently, carcass contamination by s. enterica and y. enterocolitica was more likely attributable to cross-contamination than to self-contamination, suggesting that good hygienic measures and slaughtering procedures can control transmission  of these pathogens to pork meat.

TI  == differential modulation of intracellular survival of cytosolic and vacuolar pathogens by curcumin.
AB  == curcumin, a principal component of turmeric, acts as an immunomodulator regulating the host defenses in response to a diseased condition. the role of curcumin in controlling certain infectious diseases is highly controversial. it is known to alleviate symptoms of helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbate that of leishmania infection. we have evaluated the role of curcumin in modulating the fate of various intracellular bacterial pathogens. we show that pretreatment of macrophages with curcumin attenuates the infections caused by shigella flexneri (clinical isolates) and listeria monocytogenes and aggravates those caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18 (a clinical isolate), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica. thus, the antimicrobial nature of curcumin is not a general phenomenon. it modulated the intracellular survival of cytosolic (s. flexneri and l. monocytogenes) and vacuolar (salmonella spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. aureus) bacteria in distinct ways. through colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that curcumin prevented the active phagosomal escape of cytosolic pathogens and enhanced the active inhibition of lysosomal fusion by vacuolar pathogens. a chloroquine resistance assay confirmed that curcumin retarded the escape of the cytosolic pathogens, thus reducing their inter- and intracellular spread. we have demonstrated that the membrane-stabilizing activity of curcumin is crucial for its differential effect on the virulence of the bacteria.

TI  == human alpha-defensin 6 promotes mucosal innate immunity through self-assembled peptide nanonets.
AB  == defensins are antimicrobial peptides that contribute broadly to innate immunity,  including protection of mucosal tissues. human alpha-defensin (hd) 6 is highly expressed by secretory paneth cells of the small intestine. however, in contrast  to the other defensins, it lacks appreciable bactericidal activity. nevertheless, we report here that hd6 affords protection against invasion by enteric bacterial  pathogens in vitro and in vivo. after stochastic binding to bacterial surface proteins, hd6 undergoes ordered self-assembly to form fibrils and nanonets that surround and entangle bacteria. this self-assembly mechanism occurs in vivo, requires histidine-27, and is consistent with x-ray crystallography data. these findings support a key role for hd6 in protecting the small intestine against invasion by diverse enteric pathogens and may explain the conservation of hd6 throughout hominidae evolution.

TI  == recent findings about the yersinia enterocolitica phage shock protein response.
AB  == the phage shock protein (psp) system is a conserved extracytoplasmic stress response in bacteria that is essential for virulence of the human pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. this article summarizes some recent findings about y. enterocolitica psp system function. increased psp gene expression requires the transcription factor pspf, but under non-inducing conditions pspf is inhibited by an interaction with another protein, pspa, in the cytoplasm. a psp-inducing stimulus causes pspa to relocate to the cytoplasmic membrane, freeing pspf to induce psp gene expression. this pspa relocation requires the integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins, pspb and pspc, which might sense an inducing trigger and sequester pspa by direct interaction. the subsequent induction of psp gene expression increases the pspa concentration, which also allows it to contact the membrane directly, perhaps for its physiological function. mutational analysis of the pspb and pspc proteins has revealed that they both positively and negatively regulate psp gene expression and has also identified pspc domains associated with each function. we also compare the contrasting physiological roles of the psp system in the virulence of y. enterocolitica and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium (s. typhimurium). in s. typhimurium, pspa maintains the  proton motive force, which provides the energy needed to drive ion importers required for survival within macrophages. in contrast, in the extracellular pathogen y. enterocolitica, pspb and pspc, but not pspa, are the psp components needed for virulence. pspbc protect y. enterocolitica from damage caused by the secretin component of its type 3 secretion system, an essential virulence factor.

TI  == emergence and stability of high-pressure resistance in different food-borne pathogens.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) processing is becoming a valuable nonthermal food pasteurization technique, although there is reasonable concern that bacterial hhp resistance could compromise the safety and stability of hhp-processed foods. while the degree of natural hhp resistance has already been shown to vary greatly among and within bacterial species, a still unresolved question remains as to what extent different food-borne pathogens can actually develop hhp resistance. in this study, we therefore examined and compared the intrinsic potentials for hhp resistance development among strains of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri,  salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria innocua using a selective enrichment approach. interestingly, of all strains examined, the acquisition of extreme hhp resistance could be detected in only some of the e. coli strains, indicating that a specific genetic predisposition might be required for resistance development. furthermore, once acquired, hhp resistance proved to be a very stable trait that was maintained for >80 generations in the absence of hhp exposure. finally, at the mechanistic level, hhp resistance was not necessarily linked to derepression of the heat shock genes and was not related to the phenomenon of persistence.

TI  == long-term trends in the epidemiology and resistance of childhood bacterial enteropathogens in crete.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. the study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at heraklion university general hospital on the island of crete during the 18-year period from january 1993 to december 2010. stool specimens were tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), yersinia, and aeromonas species. of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. the 1,597 isolates from children were identified as s. enterica (42.3%), campylobacter spp. (33.6%), epec (17.4%), y. enterocolitica (5.82%), a. hydrophila (0.44%), and shigella spp. (0.38%). a decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. during the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. these changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management.

AB  == salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis are the two predominant serogroups, responsible for about 80% of all human cases of salmonelosis in poland. therefore we compared the usefulness of lipopolysaccharides antigens extracted by phenol (westphal method) and trichloroacetic acid (boivine method) from salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis in elisa method for the determination of antibodies. we used one home - made lps antigen and two others commercially available antigens from sigma - aldrich. our study showed that the presence of antibodies was found in 35 (74.5%) sera from 47 samples from patients with suspected salmonelosis. there was no significant statistical differences of frequency of appearance of antibodies to all three salmonella antigens in sera from patients with salmonelosis and in sera from control group. this study showed that all three antigens are useful for determination of iga, igg, igm antibodies  for salmonella serogroup b and d in routine serological diagnosis of salmonelosis. however, it should be considered possibility of cross-reaction between lps antigen of salmonella and antibodies to yersinia enterocolitica which could be correlated with similarity between somatic antigens of these two pathogens.

TI  == acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == the endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. for this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in acanthamoeba polyphaga. our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. we can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in a. polyphaga. the first type, showed by y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. the  second type, showed by e. faecalis and s. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. the extracellular count in presence of a. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of e. faecalis, s. aureus, l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila. our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with a. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

AB  == objective: enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis  (jia-era) clinically resembles reactive arthritis (rea). in patients with rea the immune response is targeted at the outer membrane protein (omp) of salmonella typhimurium. we studied the immune response in jia-era to s. typhimurium omp. methods: synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were isolated from blood and sf of patients with jia-era. lymphocyte transformation test was done with s. typhimurium omp and crude bacterial lysates  of yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, and s. typhimurium. igg and iga elisa were performed in serum and sf using s. typhimurium omp as antigen and compared with sera from healthy controls. results: in pbmc samples (n = 25) an antigen-specific proliferative response was seen in 13 patients and a cross-reactive response in 6. among these 19 patients, 12 showed response to omp. in sfmc (n = 15) antigen-specific responses were seen in 3 patients and cross-reactive responses in 9. among these 12 patients, 11 showed response to omp. the igg and iga anti-omp antibody concentrations in serum and sf were similar in patients and controls. conclusion: in jia-era, omp is the major antigenic target recognized by both sfmc and pbmc. response to omp is independent of specific bacterial response, suggesting that omp is the immunodominant antigen. in these patients, absence of significant humoral response suggests response to omp is mainly t cell mediated.

TI  == rapid multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis of shigella spp. using multicolour capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == the multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (mlva) method for genotyping has proven to be a fast and reliable typing tool in several bacterial  species. mlva is in our laboratory the routine typing method for salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli (two assays), listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. the gram-negative invasive enteropathogenic bacterium shigella is the most common cause of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) worldwide, and is a global human health problem. it was of great interest to develop a rapid and robust mlva-assay for this important pathogen. though not common in norway, we do receive isolates mostly associated with foreign travel and thus an outbreak may be possible. the resulting mlva-assay is based on seven polymorphous vntrs found by search in the published  genomes of all shigella species. the assay is fast (one multiplexed pcr reaction), robust and show high divergence among the shigellae. a total of 235 shigella spp. were typed with 194 distinct mlva-genotypes. an outbreak cluster of shigella sonnei was additionally identified during manuscript preparation.

TI  == foodborne proportion of gastrointestinal illness: estimates from a canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  == the study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of the  foodborne attributable proportion for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens  in canada. it was based on a similar study conducted in the united states and focused on campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella spp., vibrio spp., yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium parvum, and norwalk-like virus. for each pathogen, experts were asked to provide their best estimate and low and high limits for the proportion of foodborne illness relative to total cases. in addition, they provided background information with regard to food safety experience, including self-evaluated expertise for each pathogen on a 5-point scale. a snowball approach was used to identify 152 experts within canada. the experts' background details were summarized using descriptive statistics. factor  analysis was used to determine whether the variability in best estimates was related to self-assessed level of expertise or other background information. cluster analysis followed by beta function fitting was undertaken on best estimates from experts who self-evaluated their expertise 3 or higher. in parallel, monte carlo resampling was run using triangular distributions based on  each expert's best estimate and its limits. sixty-six experts encompassing various academic backgrounds, fields of expertise, and experiences relevant to food safety provided usable data. considerable variation between experts in their estimated foodborne attributable proportions was observed over all diseases, without any relationship to the expert's background. uncertainty about their estimate (measured by the low and high limits) varied between experts and between pathogens as well. both cluster analysis and monte carlo resampling clearly indicated disagreement between experts for campylobacter, e. coli o157, l. monocytogenes, salmonella, vibrio, and y. enterocolitica. in the absence of more  reliable estimates, the observed discrepancy between experts must be explored and understood before one can judge which opinion is the best.

TI  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli, samonella, shigella and yersinia: cellular aspects of host-bacteria interactions in enteric diseases.
AB  == a successful infection of the human intestine by enteropathogenic bacteria depends on the ability of bacteria to attach and colonize the intestinal epithelium and, in some cases, to invade the host cell, survive intracellularly and disseminate from cell to cell. to accomplish these processes bacteria have evolved an arsenal of molecules that are mostly secreted by dedicated type iii secretion systems, and that interact with the host, subverting normal cellular functions. here we overview the most important molecular strategies developed by  enteropathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella flexneri, and yersinia enterocolitica to cause enteric infections. despite having evolved different effectors, these four microorganisms share common host cellular targets.

TI  == human complement factor h binds to outer membrane protein rck of salmonella.
AB  == serum resistance, or resistance to complement-mediated killing, is a key virulence property of microbial pathogens. rck is a 17-kda outer membrane protein encoded on the virulence plasmid of salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and  enteritidis. when expressed in either escherichia coli or s. enterica typhimurium, rck confers serum resistance independent of lps length. recently, the rck homolog from yersinia enterocolitica, ail, has been shown to bind the complement regulatory protein factor h (fh). based on these observations, we hypothesized that rck may also possess this ability. using both flow cytometery and direct binding analysis, we demonstrate that rck expressed in e. coli binds fh. we observed fh binding to rck from human serum and also using the purified protein. expression of rck protected bacteria from alternative pathway-mediated killing and was associated with a reduction in c3b, bb, and membrane attack complex deposition. fh bound to rck promoted c3b cleavage in the presence of factor i. binding was specific and mediated by two regions in fh, the short consensus repeats 5-7 and 19 to 20. these results suggest that fh recruitment by  rck is functional and can protect a normally serum-sensitive heterologous host against complement attack. binding and exploitation of fh may thus contribute to  rck-mediated serum resistance.

TI  == high bacterial contamination of pig tonsils at slaughter.
AB  == food-borne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrial countries. campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes are high-risk food-borne zoonotic hazards in finishing pigs. the objectives of this work were (1) to study the isolation rate of pathogenic y. enterocolitica, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and l. monocytogenes in the tonsils and feces and (2) to determine the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria  (mab) and escherichia coli in the tonsils of fattening pigs at slaughter. the samples, which were collected from one slaughterhouse on five occasions, originated from 50 pigs and 15 farms. the number of mab varied from 6.40 to 7.82  log(10) cfu/g and e. coli from 4.38 to 6.53 log(10) cfu/g. additionally, 31 (62%) of the tonsils were colonized with y. enterocolitica and 16 (32%) with l. monocytogenes. campylobacter spp. were more frequently excreted in feces and only 3 (6%) of the pigs carried campylobacter spp. in the tonsils. no salmonella spp.  were isolated. the pig tonsils were shown to be colonized with a high number of bacteria including e. coli, which is the most important indicator for fecal contamination, and with y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes, which are important food-borne pathogens. this study demonstrates that the tonsils are highly contaminated with micro-organisms and can be a very important source of contamination in the slaughterhouse.

AB  == given the central role of intestinal dendritic cells (dcs) in the regulation of gut immune responses, it is not surprising that several bacterial pathogens have  evolved strategies to prevent or bypass recognition by dcs. in this article, we will review recent findings on the interaction between intestinal dcs and prototypical bacterial pathogens, such as salmonella, yersinia, or helicobacter.  we will discuss the different approaches with which these pathogens seek to evade dc recognition and subsequent t cell activation. these diverse strategies span to include mounting irrelevant immune responses, inhibition of ag presentation by dcs, and stretch as far as to manipulate the th1/th2 balance of cd4(+) t cells in the bacteria's favor.

TI  == rankl is necessary and sufficient to initiate development of antigen-sampling m cells in the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == microfold cells (m cells) are specialized epithelial cells situated over peyer's  patches (pp) and other organized mucosal lymphoid tissues that transport commensal bacteria and other particulate ags into intraepithelial pockets accessed by apcs. the tnf superfamily member receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) is selectively expressed by subepithelial stromal cells in pp domes. we found that rankl null mice have <2% of wild-type levels of pp m cells and markedly diminished uptake of 200 nm diameter fluorescent beads. ab-mediated  neutralization of rankl in adult wild-type mice also eliminated most pp m cells.  the m cell deficit in rankl null mice was corrected by systemic administration of exogenous rankl. treatment with rankl also induced the differentiation of villous m cells on all small intestinal villi with the capacity for avid uptake of salmonella and yersinia organisms and fluorescent beads. the rank receptor for rankl is expressed by epithelial cells throughout the small intestine. we conclude that availability of rankl is the critical factor controlling the differentiation of m cells from rank-expressing intestinal epithelial precursor cells.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium can detect acyl homoserine lactone production by yersinia enterocolitica in mice.
AB  == luxr-type transcription factors detect acyl homoserine lactones (ahls) and are typically used by bacteria to determine the population density of their own species. escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cannot synthesize ahls but can detect the ahls produced by other bacterial species using the luxr homolog, sdia. previously we determined that s. typhimurium did not detect ahls during transit through the gastrointestinal tract of a guinea pig, a  rabbit, a cow, 5 mice, 6 pigs, or 12 chickens. however, sdia was activated during transit through turtles colonized by aeromonas hydrophila, leading to the hypothesis that sdia is used for detecting the ahl production of other pathogens. in this report, we determined that sdia is activated during the transit of s. typhimurium through mice infected with the ahl-producing pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. sdia is not activated during transit through mice infected with a yeni mutant of y. enterocolitica that cannot synthesize ahls. however, activation of sdia did not confer a fitness advantage in yersinia-infected mice. we hypothesized that this is due to infrequent or short interactions between s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica or that the sdia regulon members do not function in mice. to test these hypotheses, we constructed an s. typhimurium strain that synthesizes ahls to mimic a constant interaction with y. enterocolitica. in this background, sdia(+) s. typhimurium rapidly outcompetes the sdia mutant in mice. all known members of the sdia regulon are required for this phenotype. thus, all members of the sdia regulon are functional in mice.

AB  == the use of live recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines (rasv) synthesizing yersinia proteins is a promising approach for controlling infection by yersinia species. in this study, we constructed attenuated salmonella strains which synthesize a truncated form of lcrv, lcrv196 and evaluated the immune response and protective efficacy elicited by these strains in mice against two other major species of yersinia: yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. surprisingly, we found that the rasv strain alone was sufficient to afford nearly full protection against challenge with y. pseudotuberculosis, indicating the likelihood that salmonella produces immunogenic cross-protective antigens. in contrast, lcrv196 expression was required for protection against challenge with y. enterocolitica strain 8081, but was not sufficient to achieve significant protection against challenge with y. enterocolitica strain wa, which expressed a  divergent form of lcrv. nevertheless, we are encouraged by these findings to continue pursuing our long-term goal of developing a single vaccine to protect against all three human pathogenic species of yersinia.

TI  == insights into the evolution of sialic acid catabolism among bacteria.
AB  == background: sialic acids comprise a family of nine-carbon amino sugars that are prevalent in mucus rich environments. sialic acids from the human host are used by a number of pathogens as an energy source. here we explore the evolution of the genes involved in the catabolism of sialic acid. results: the cluster of genes encoding the enzymes n-acetylneuraminate lyase (nana), epimerase (nane), and kinase (nank), necessary for the catabolism of sialic acid (the nan cluster), are confined 46 bacterial species, 42 of which colonize mammals, 33 as pathogens  and 9 as gut commensals. we found a putative sialic acid transporter associated with the nan cluster in most species. we reconstructed the phylogenetic history of the nana, nane, and nank proteins from the 46 species and compared them to the species tree based on 16s rrna. within the nana phylogeny, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria do not form distinct clades. nana from yersinia and vibrio species was most closely related to the nana clade from eukaryotes. to examine this further, we reconstructed the phylogeny of all nana homologues in the databases. in this analysis of 83 nana sequences, bacteroidetes, a human commensal group formed a distinct clade with verrucomicrobia, and branched with the eukaryotes and the yersinia/vibrio clades. we speculate that pathogens such as v. cholerae may have acquired nana from a commensal aiding their colonization  of the human gut. both the nane and nank phylogenies more closely represented the species tree but numerous incidences of incongruence are noted. we confirmed the  predicted function of the sialic acid catabolism cluster in members the major intestinal pathogens salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, v. vulnificus, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pestis. conclusion: the nan cluster among bacteria is confined to human pathogens and commensals conferring them the ability to utilize a ubiquitous carbon source in mucus rich surfaces of the human body. the  nan region shows a mosaic evolution with nana from bacteroidetes, vibrio and yersinia branching closely together with nana from eukaryotes.

AB  == gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens are a worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. the ability to carry out epidemiological investigations to determine the primary sources of bacterial contamination is important to improve  public health. multiple methods are available for bacterial source tracking and to determine the distribution of pathogens isolated from sick patients. the molecular based typing methods available fall into three general categories: those based on restriction analysis of the bacterial dna; those based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of particular genetic targets; and  those based on the identification of dna sequence polymorphisms. the techniques that are examined in this review include: plasmid analysis, restriction fragment  length polymorphism methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, pcr-based genotyping, variable number of tandem repeat analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. these methods are described along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques for genotyping the major gram-negative foodborne pathogens--campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, shigella spp., escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica.

AB  == forty-two representative strains of native bacteria associated with fresh peeled  baby carrots were isolated and characterized. two of these strains, identified as pseudomonas fluorescens ag3a (pf ag3a) and bacillus yd1, were evaluated in conjunction with another known antagonist, p. fluorescens 2-79 (pf 2-79), for their potential as biocontrol agents of human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7) and soft-rot bacteria (erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, pseudomonas marginalis,  and pseudomonas viridiflava). when grown on iron-deficient agar media, all three  antagonists produced inhibition zones up to 25 mm in diameter against the growth  of human pathogens and soft-rot bacteria. however, when grown on iron-rich agar media, only pf 2-79 and bacillus yd1 exhibited antimicrobial activity. treatment  of bell pepper disks with pf 2-79 or bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogen  by 1.4 to 4.1 log units, depending upon the ratio of the number of antagonist cells to pathogen cells (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1). the greatest reduction was observed when 10- to 100-fold higher number of antagonists than pathogens was applied. pf ag3a and bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogens on pepper disks at 20 degrees c but not at 10 degrees c. however, pf 2-79 reduced the growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica by up to 4 log units at either 20 or 10 degrees c. treatment of pepper disks with pf 2-79 also reduced the incidence of soft rot induced by soft-rot bacteria by 40 to 70%. pf 2-79 is the most effective of the three antagonists tested for control of spoilage bacteria and human pathogens on bell pepper.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for bacterial food-borne zoonotic hazards in slaughter pigs: a review.
AB  == the hygiene package and regulation ec-2160/2003 require information flow from farm to slaughterhouse to enhance european consumers protection in a 'farm to fork' approach. this obligation especially concerns food-borne zoonotic hazards transmitted to humans through pork consumption, such as thermophilic campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica. prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure. individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage (from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding (from faeces).  among risk factors described in the literature, poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio-security measures are of major significance. moreover, whereas wet feed increases the risk of pig infection by l. monocytogenes, dry feed is a risk factor for salm. enterica. mixing batches of pigs, notably in fattening herds, represents a risk for the transmission of salm. enterica and y. enterocolitica. whereas small herds are more infected by thermophilic campylobacters and y. enterocolitica, higher prevalence of salmonella is observed in large herds due to a more frequent mixing of batches. antibiotic treatment during the finishing period increases the risk of transmission of salm. enterica. the forenamed elements should be taken into account to characterize farms in a risk assessment approach and to improve zoonotic hazard management in the pork food chain.

TI  == bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  == bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. to focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in caco-2bbe and nci-h292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and  transmission electron microscopy revealed that staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae particles. endocytosed staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for yersinia, suggesting that  cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. interestingly,  when staphylococcus and yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of nci-h292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked  uptake of both yersinia and staphylococcus in nci-h292 and caco-2bbe cells. our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  == use of hog (sus scrofa) manure as a fertilizer is a practical solution for waste  re-utilization, however, it may serve as a vehicle for environmental and domestic animal contamination. work was conducted to determine whether pathogens, naturally present in hog manure could be detected in cattle (bos taurus) grazed on the manure-treated pasture, and whether forage contamination occurred. during  two 3 mo summer trials manure was applied to yield < or = 124 kg available n per  hectare in a single spring or split spring and fall application. samples of hog manure, forage, soil, and cattle feces were analyzed for naturally occurring salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli. to follow movement of  salmonella in the environment isolates were identified to serovar and serotyped.  transfer of e. coli from hog manure to soil and cattle was examined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis of >600 e. coli isolates. while y. enterocolitica was absent from all samples, in both years s. enterica derby and s. enterica krefeld were found in most hog manure samples, but were only on forage samples in the second year. salmonella enterica typhimurium, absent from hog manure was present on some forage in the first year. cattle feces and soil samples were consistently salmonella negative. these contaminations could not be  traced to manure application. during this study, salmonella and e. coli found in  hog manure had different rapd genomic profiles from those found in the feces of cattle grazing on manure-treated pasture.

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

AB  == background & aims: hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif-1) is the key transcriptional  regulator during adaptation to hypoxia. recent studies provide evidence for hif-1 activation during bacterial infections. however, molecular details of how bacteria activate hif-1 remain unclear. here, we pursued the role of bacterial siderophores in hif-1 activation during infection with enterobacteriaceae. methods: in vivo, hif-1 activation and hif-1-dependent gene induction in peyer's  patches were analyzed after orogastric infection with yersinia enterocolitica. the course of an orogastric y enterocolitica infection was determined using mice  with a deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestine. in vitro, the mechanism of hif-1  activation was analyzed in infections with y enterocolitica, salmonella enterica  subsp enterica, and enterobacter aerogenes. results: infection of mice with y enterocolitica led to functional activation of hif-1 in peyer's patches. because  mice with deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestinal epithelium showed a significantly higher susceptibility to orogastric y enterocolitica infections, bacterial hif-1 activation appears to represent a host defense mechanism. additional studies with y enterocolitica, s enterica subsp enterica, or e aerogenes, and, moreover, application of their siderophores (yersiniabactin, salmochelin, aerobactin) caused a robust, dose-dependent hif-1 response in human  epithelia and endothelia, independent of cellular hypoxia. hif-1 activation occurs most likely because of inhibition of prolylhydroxylase activity and is abolished upon infection with siderophore uptake deficient bacteria. conclusions: taken together, this study reveals what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role of bacterial siderophores for hypoxia-independent activation of hif-1 during infection with human pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == foodborne zoonoses due to meat: a quantitative approach for a comparative risk assessment applied to pig slaughtering in europe.
AB  == foodborne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrialised countries. new european food safety regulations were issued to apply risk analysis to the food chain. the severity of foodborne zoonoses and the exposure of humans to biological hazards transmitted by food must be assessed. for meat, inspection at  the slaughterhouse is historically the main means of control to protect consumers. however, the levels of detection of biological hazards during meat inspection have not been established in quantitative terms yet. pork is the most  frequently consumed meat in europe. the aim of this study was to provide elements for quantifying levels of risk for pork consumers and lack of detection by meat inspection. information concerning hazard identification and characterisation was obtained by the compilation and statistical analysis of data from 440 literature  references. the incidence and severity of human cases due to pork consumption in  europe were assessed in order to calculate risk scores. a ratio of non-control was calculated for each biological hazard identified as currently established in  europe, i.e. the incidence of human cases divided by the prevalence of hazards on pork. salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter spp. were characterised by high incidence rates. listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum and mycobacterium spp. showed the highest severity scores. the three main high risk hazards involved in foodborne infections, y. enterocolitica, s. enterica and campylobacter spp. are characterised by high non-control ratios and  cannot be detected by macroscopic examination of carcasses. new means of hazard control are needed to complement the classical macroscopic examination.

TI  == influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  == despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. we have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric h(+)/k(+)-atpase (proton pump) gene were infected with yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter rodentium, or clostridium perfringens cells or spores. significantly greater numbers of yersinia, salmonella, and citrobacter cells (p < or = 0.006) and clostridium spores (p = 0.02) survived in  hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. apart from establishing the role of  gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.

TI  == inhibition of foodborne pathogens by native microflora recovered from fresh peeled baby carrot and propagated in cultures.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of fresh peeled baby carrot and associated microflora on the viability and growth of listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and pseudomonas marginalis was investigated. the population of viable l. monocytogenes was reduced by more than  2 logs following the dipping of sliced baby carrots in the bacterial suspension for 2 min. however, other pathogens subjected to the same treatment showed no reduction in the population. surface sanitization of baby carrots reduced the number of native microflora and in turn increased the growth of each pathogen on  this commodity by 2 to 3 logs. filter-sterilized carrot homogenates exhibited no  antimicrobial activity and were capable of supporting the growth of each pathogen to a density of over 2 x 10(9) cfu/ml. however, the growth of each pathogen in carrot homogenates containing microflora recovered from baby carrot and propagated in tryptic soy broth was reduced 2 to 3 logs after incubation at 28 degrees c for 2 d. on pepper disks, which have no antilisterial activity and very low levels of background microflora, the addition of carrot microflora also reduced the growth of each pathogen 2 to 4 logs after 2 d at 20 degrees c. the reduction was dependent upon the ratio between the number of carrot microflora and pathogen tested. the growth of l. monocytogenes or y. enterocolitica on pepper disks containing carrot microflora was almost completely stopped after storage at 8 degrees c for 8 d. the inhibitory effect of baby carrots on pathogens is in part due to the antimicrobial activity of carrot tissue and in part due to the antagonistic action of associated microflora.

TI  == recombining population structure of plesiomonas shigelloides (enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa,  leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains  from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position  of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

TI  == study of predominant bacterial antigens triggering antibody response in salmonella reactive arthritis: apropos of a case.
AB  == reactive arthritis (rea) is a sterile arthritis triggered by distal mucosal infection, which suggests a contribution from bacterial products. the pathogenesis of rea is unclear. there are no international standards for the serological methods used to confirm rea. in the present work, we analyzed the predominant bacterial component that triggered an immune response in a 24-year-old woman with acute rea. the candidate bacterial trigger was investigated by measuring the antibacterial antibodies (all immunoglobulin classes and iga) to salmonella enteritidis, shigella flexneri and yersinia enterocolitica. elisa for salmonella gave a positive result. to identify the bacterial component triggering rea, antibodies to crude lysate, outer membrane proteins (omp), cytosolic fraction, supernatant proteins and lipopolysaccharide of s. enteritidis were analyzed in sera and synovial fluid (sf) by elisa, dot blot, and western blot. among the antigen preparations, the antibody response to  omp was dominant in both serum and sf; a strong reaction to seven omp bands (50-21 kda) was observed. we concluded that omp were the main bacterial antigens  that trigged rea in the reported case. determining the triggering bacterial components in each case can help elucidate the precise causes of rea and will contribute to the designing of a specific serological diagnostic method for this  arthritis.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == a rapid multiplexed chemiluminescent immunoassay for the detection of escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes pathogen bacteria.
AB  == a simple and rapid multiplexed sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the simultaneous detection of escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes. to achieve the multiplexed detection of the four pathogens, a new polystyrene 96 well microtiter plate format has been designed, in which each main well contains  four subwells in the bottom. the monoclonal antibodies specific for each bacteria were separately immobilized in each subwell. when the samples were added to the main wells, the bacteria able to specifically bind to the corresponding monoclonal antibody were captured in one of the four subwells. subsequently, a mixture of peroxidase-labeled polyclonal antibodies against the four bacteria was added and the peroxidase activity of the bound polyclonal labeled antibodies in each well was measured by an enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent cocktail using a low-light charge-coupled imaging device. the assay was simple and fast, and the limit of quantification was in the order of 104-105 cfu/ml for all bacterial species. the accuracy of the method, evaluated by comparison of the results with a conventional culturing methodology, was satisfactory, with recovery values ranging from 90 to 120%. this method can be used as a screening test to evaluate the presence of these pathogen bacteria in different foodstuffs.

TI  == general and specific host responses to bacterial infection in peyer's patches: a  role for stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3) during salmonella enterica infection.
AB  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) and yersinia enterocolitica are enteric pathogens capable of colonizing and inducing inflammatory responses in peyer's patches (pps) and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns). although the tissue colonization pattern is similar between these two pathogens, their pathogenic lifestyles are quite different. for example, while s. typhimurium is primarily an intracellular pathogen, y. enterocolitica survives primarily extracellularly. we determined and compared the transcriptional changes occurring in response to s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica colonization of pp  using affymetrix genechip technology. both pathogens elicited a general inflammatory response indicated by the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines.  however, specific differences were also observed, most notably in the transcriptional regulation of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and ifn-gamma-regulated genes in response to s. typhimurium but not y. enterocolitica. of particular note, a group of genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) had increased transcript numbers in the pps following infection with both pathogens. the experiments described here compare oral s. typhimurium or y. enterocolitica infection in stromelysin-1 (mmp-3)-deficient mice (mmp-3(-/-)) with mice possessing functional mmp-3 (mmp-3(+/+)). there was little difference in the survival of mmp-3-deficient mice infected with y. enterocolitica when compared with littermate controls. surprisingly though, mmp-3(-/-) mice were markedly more resistant to s. typhimurium infection than the control mice. s. typhimurium was able to colonize mmp-3(-/-) mice, albeit in a delayed fashion, to equivalent levels as mmp-3(+/+) mice. nevertheless, significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected in tissues and serum in the mmp-3(-/-) mice in comparison with mmp-3(+/+) mice. we hypothesize that mmp-3 is involved in initiating an early and lethal cytokine response to s.  typhimurium colonization.

TI  == blockade of catecholamine-induced growth by adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor  antagonists in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == background: the ability of catecholamines to stimulate bacterial growth was first demonstrated just over a decade ago. little is still known however, concerning the nature of the putative bacterial adrenergic and/or dopaminergic receptor(s) to which catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) may bind and exert their effects, or even whether the binding properties of such a receptor are similar between different species. results: use of specific catecholamine receptor antagonists revealed that only alpha, and not beta, adrenergic antagonists were capable of blocking norepinephrine and epinephrine-induced growth, while antagonism of dopamine-mediated growth was achieved with the use of a dopaminergic antagonist. both adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists were highly specific in their mechanism of action, which did not involve blockade of catecholamine-facilitated iron-acquisition. use of radiolabeled norepinephrine suggested that the adrenergic antagonists could be acting by inhibiting catecholamine uptake. conclusion: the present data demonstrates that the ability  of a specific pathogen to respond to a particular hormone is dependent upon the host anatomical region in which the pathogen causes disease as well as the neuroanatomical specificity to which production of the particular hormone is restricted; and that both are anatomically coincidental to each other. as such, the present report suggests that pathogens with a high degree of exclusivity to the gastrointestinal tract have evolved response systems to neuroendocrine hormones such as norepinephrine and dopamine, but not epinephrine, which are found with the enteric nervous system.

TI  == specificity of catecholamine-induced growth in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the present study demonstrates that catecholamine responsiveness in yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterial pathogen whose infectious spectrum is principally limited to the gut, is limited to norepinephrine and dopamine, and not epinephrine; this behavior contrasts with observations for two pathogens with a wider extra-gastrointestinal spectrum, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica, which respond to all three catecholamines. epinephrine showed lower potency than norepinephrine and dopamine in inducing growth of e. coli and s. enterica, and was a potent antagonist of norepinephrine and dopamine growth responsiveness in y. enterocolitica. given that only norepinephrine and dopamine  and not epinephrine-containing neurons are found with the enteric nervous system, the results suggest that certain of the more exclusive enteric pathogens may have developed response systems preferentially for those neuroendocrine hormones that  are produced by the enteric nervous system as host-derived signals by which to sense the environment and initiate pathogenic processes.

TI  == joint spatial analysis of gastrointestinal infectious diseases.
AB  == a major obstacle in the spatial analysis of infectious disease surveillance data  is the problem of under-reporting. this article investigates the possibility of inferring reporting rates through joint statistical modelling of several infectious diseases with different aetiologies. once variation in under-reporting can be estimated, geographic risk patterns for infections associated with specific food vehicles may be discerned. we adopt the shared component model, proposed by knorr-held and best for two chronic diseases and further extended by  (held l, natario i, fenton s, rue h, becker n. towards joint disease mapping. statistical methods in medical research 2005b; 14: 61-82) for more than two chronic diseases to the infectious disease setting. our goal is to estimate a shared component, common to all diseases, which may be interpreted as representing the spatial variation in reporting rates. additional components are  introduced to describe the real spatial variation of the different diseases. of course, this interpretation is only allowed under specific assumptions, in particular, the geographical variation in under-reporting should be similar for the diseases considered. in addition, it is vital that the data do not contain large local outbreaks, so adjustment based on a time series method recently proposed by (held l, hohle m, hofmann m. a statistical framework for the analysis of multivariate infectious disease surveillance data. statistical modelling 2005a; 5: 187-99) is made at a preliminary stage. we will illustrate our approach through the analysis of gastrointestinal diseases notification data obtained from the german infectious disease surveillance system, administered by the robert koch institute in berlin.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

AB  == seven monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7, one of  the major causes of haemorrhagic colitis in humans, were produced by immunising balb/c mice with the strain e. coli o157:h7. these monoclonal antibodies do not cross-react with other bacteria such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium,  e. coli o14, e. coli jm109, s. enterica serovar enteritidis, s. panama, s. saintpaul, s. derby, s. muenchen, s. bredeney, s. hadar, yersinia enterocolitica, proteus vulgaris, shigella flexneri, listeria ivanovii, l. monocytogenes 13m, l.  innocua, enterobacter cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. amnigenus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia fergussoni or klebsiella pneumoniae. of the seven mabs obtained, mab 8b8c3 was selected to prepare a high-sensitivity sandwich elisa method specific for o157:h7.

TI  == a survey of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk and raw milk consumption among  farm families in pennsylvania.
AB  == a 2-part study was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to human pathogens from raw milk. the first part of the study focused on determining raw milk consumption habits of dairy producers. a total of 248 dairy producers from 16 counties in pennsylvania were surveyed. overall, 105 (42.3%) of the 248 dairy producers consumed raw milk and 170 (68.5%) of the 248 dairy producers were aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk. dairy producers who were not aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk were 2-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with dairy producers who were aware of foodborne pathogens. the majority of dairy producers who consumed raw milk indicated that taste (72%) and convenience (60%) were the primary factors for consuming raw milk. dairy producers who resided on the dairy farm were nearly 3-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with those who lived elsewhere. in the second part of the study, bulk tank milk from the 248 participating dairy herds was examined for foodborne pathogens. campylobacter jejuni (2%), shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (2.4%), listeria monocytogenes (2.8%), salmonella (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (1.2%) were detected in the milk samples. salmonella isolates were identified as s. enterica serotype typhimurium (n = 10) and s. enterica serotype  newport (n = 5). of the 248 bulk tank milk samples, 32 (13%) contained > or = 1 species of bacterial pathogens. the findings of the study could assist in developing farm community-based educational programs on the risks of consuming raw milk.

TI  == an outer membrane enzyme encoded by salmonella typhimurium lpxr that removes the  3'-acyloxyacyl moiety of lipid a.
AB  == the salmonella and related bacteria modify the structure of the lipid a portion of their lipopolysaccharide in response to environmental stimuli. some lipid a modifications are required for virulence and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. we now demonstrate that membranes of salmonella typhimurium contain a novel hydrolase that removes the 3'-acyloxyacyl residue of lipid a in the presence of 5 mm ca2+. we have identified the gene encoding the s. typhimurium lipid a 3'-o-deacylase, designated lpxr, by screening an ordered s. typhimurium genomic dna library, harbored in escherichia coli k-12, for expression of ca2+-dependent 3'-o-deacylase activity in membranes. lpxr is synthesized with an  n-terminal type i signal peptide and is localized to the outer membrane. mass spectrometry was used to confirm the position of lipid a deacylation in vitro and the release of the intact 3'-acyloxyacyl group. heterologous expression of lpxr in the e. coli k-12 w3110, which lacks lpxr, resulted in production of significant amounts of 3'-o-deacylated lipid a in growing cultures. orthologues of lpxr are present in the genomes of e. coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, and vibrio cholerae. the function of lpxr is unknown, but it could play a role in pathogenesis because it might modulate the cytokine response of an infected animal.

AB  == a rapid bead assay for detecting pathogenic bacteria with a simple microfluidic chip-based system was developed. five oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the 16s rrna of the targeted bacteria were coupled covalently to fluorescent beads. four species of bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, and bacillus cereus) were used as representative food-borne pathogenic bacteria. the rnas extracted from pure cultures of these microorganisms were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the oligonucleotide probes-immobilized fluorescent beads (bead assay). the duplexes of rnas and the probes-immobilized beads were analyzed with the commercially available microfluidic chip-based system. this bead assay provided results within 3 h following rna extraction from bacterial cells.

TI  == multiple promoters control expression of the yersinia enterocolitica phage-shock-protein a (pspa) operon.
AB  == the widely conserved phage-shock-protein a (pspa) operon encodes an extracytoplasmic stress response system that is essential for virulence in yersinia enterocolitica, and has been linked to other important phenotypes in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and shigella flexneri. regulation of pspa operon expression is mediated through a promoter upstream of pspa that depends on sigma factor rpon (sigma(54)) and the enhancer binding protein pspf. pspa, pspb and pspc, encoded within the pspa operon, also regulate expression by participating in a putative signal transduction pathway that probably serves to modulate pspf activity. all of this suggests that appropriate expression of the pspa operon is critical. previous genetic analysis of the y. enterocolitica pspa  operon suggested that an additional level of complexity might be mediated by pspf/rpon-independent expression of some psp genes. here, an rpon null mutation and interposon analysis were used to confirm that pspf/rpon-independent gene expression does originate within the psp locus. molecular genetic approaches were used to systematically analyse the two large non-coding regions within the psp locus. primer extension, control region deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments led to the identification of rpon-independent promoters both upstream and downstream of pspa. the precise location of the pspf/rpon-dependent promoter  upstream of pspa was also determined. the discovery of these rpon-independent promoters reveals yet another level of transcriptional complexity for the y. enterocolitica pspa operon that may function to allow low-level constitutive expression of psp genes and/or additional regulation under some conditions.

TI  == is the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis a form of chronic reactive arthritis?
AB  == objective: enteric organisms are known to trigger reactive arthritis. the enthesitis-related arthritis (era) form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) clinically resembles reactive arthritis. therefore, we looked for a role of enteric bacteria in era. methods: synovial fluid (sf) was obtained from 26 patients with era and 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). blood specimens were also obtained from patients with era and from 10 normal individuals. lymphocyte proliferation assays were done on whole blood and sf mononuclear cells using as antigens crude lysates of the enteric bacteria salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri and campylobacter jejuni. crude lysate of escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. hla-b27 typing was done using  the polymerase chain reaction. homing of gut-specific t cells (cd103+) to the synovial compartment was studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. the antigen-specific cytokine profile was determined by flow cytometry. results: antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were observed in 14 of 26 patients. among these patients, 12 showed a response in sf (four each to s. typhimurium and c. jejuni, and in two each to s. flexneri and y. enterocolitica), and two patients in blood (s. typhimurium in both). none of the healthy controls  showed a response in the blood. lymphoproliferative responses in sf were more frequent in patients with jia (12/26) than in controls with ra (1/10, p < 0.05).  patients with an antigen-specific response had a higher ratio of sf/blood cd103+  t cells compared with those with no antigen-specific response (p < 0.01). antigen-specific as well as mitogen-stimulated cytokine production showed a th1 bias. conclusion: enteric bacteria may have a role in exacerbation of disease in  patients with era. the immune response in patients with era is th1-dominant.

TI  == pspb and pspc of yersinia enterocolitica are dual function proteins: regulators and effectors of the phage-shock-protein response.
AB  == the phage-shock-protein (psp) stress-response system is conserved in many bacteria and has been linked to important phenotypes in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and also yersinia enterocolitica, where it is essential for virulence. it is activated by specific extracytoplasmic stress events such as the mislocalization of secretin proteins. from studies of the psp system in e. coli,  the cytoplasmic membrane proteins pspb and pspc have only been proposed to act as positive regulators of psp gene expression. however, in this study we show that pspb and pspc of y. enterocolitica are dual function proteins, acting both as regulators and effectors of the psp system. consistent with the current model, they positively control psp gene expression in response to diverse inducing cues. pspb and pspc must work together to achieve this regulatory function, and bacterial two-hybrid (bacth) analysis demonstrated a specific interaction between them, which was confirmed by in vivo cross-linking. we also show that pspb and pspc play a second role in supporting growth when a secretin protein is overexpressed. this function is independent from their role as regulators of psp  gene expression. furthermore, whereas pspb and pspc must work together for their  regulatory function, they can apparently act independently to support growth during secretin production. this study expands the current understanding of the roles played by pspb and pspc, and demonstrates that they cannot be considered only as positive regulators of psp gene expression in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == foodborne bacterial infection and hospitalization: a registry-based study.
AB  == background: foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections are important causes  of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and despite successful control programs in  some developed countries, these infections continue to have a major impact on public health and economy. methods: on the basis of data from 3 national registries, we determined short- and long-term risks of hospitalization due to gastroenteritis, short-term complications, and long-term sequelae after infections with nontyphoid salmonella enterica, campylobacter species, yersinia enterocolitica, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, and shigella species. results: among 52,121 patients, 7524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis within 90 days after microbiological diagnosis. a total of 4941 patients (17.7%) with infections due to s. enterica and 1937 (10.8%) with infections due to campylobacter species were admitted to the hospital. complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation and invasive illness, occurred in 647 patients (1.2%). the risk of invasive illness was > 6-fold higher in patients with infections due to s. enterica (odds ratio [or] compared with the general population, 30.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 26.2-35.1) than in those  with infections due to campylobacter species (or, 4.9; 95% ci, 3.5-6.8) (p < .001). long-term sequelae were seen in 865 patients (1.7%). among 1000 patients with infections due to s. enterica, 1820 days of hospital stay were attributable  to gastroenteritis, complications, and long-term sequelae. the corresponding figure for campylobacter infections was 714 days. conclusions: infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne cause considerable morbidity, in terms of severe gastroenteritis that requires admission to hospital, as well as complications and long-term sequelae. the risk of complications and sequelae depends on bacterial species, and nontyphoid salmonella is particularly associated with a burden of severe morbidity.

TI  == sensitivities of foodborne pathogens to pressure changes.
AB  == eight foodborne pathogens were suspended in ultrahigh-temperature whole milk and  treated at pressure levels of 0.1 to 690 mpa at 21.5 degrees c for 10 min. there  was no clear trend in pressure resistance between gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the order of the single strains tested, from most to least pressure sensitive, was vibrio parahaemolyticus < yersinia enterocolitica < listeria monocytogenes < salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium < s. enterica serovar enteritidis < escherichia coli o157:h7 approximately equal to staphylococcus aureus < shigella flexneri. for each organism there existed a pressure range in which log(number of survivors) had a near linear relationship when plotted versus treatment pressure level. in this study, a decimal reduction pressure (dp) value  was defined and used to measure the sensitivity of these pathogens to pressure changes. l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive to pressure changes, and s. flexneri was most resistant. the d(p) values were 16.3 mpa for l. monocytogenes, 21.7 mpa for v. parahaemolyticus, and 127.0 mpa for s. flexneri. the most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, s. flexneri, and most pressure-resistant gram-positive bacterium, s. aureus, were treated at 50 degrees c and pressures of 0.1 to 650 mpa for 10 min. high temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two organisms and affected their sensitivities to pressure changes. the effect of treatment time on the d(p) values of l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus was also determined, and it was found that it did not significantly affect their d(p) values.

TI  == the phage-shock-protein response.
AB  == the phage-shock-protein (psp) system responds to extracytoplasmic stress that may reduce the energy status of the cell. it is conserved in many different bacteria  and has been linked to several important phenotypes. escherichia coli psp mutants have defects in maintenance of the proton-motive force, protein export by the sec and tat pathways, survival in stationary phase at alkaline ph, and biofilm formation. yersinia enterocolitica psp mutants cannot grow when the secretin component of a type iii secretion system is mislocalized, and have a severe virulence defect in animals. a salmonella enterica psp mutation exacerbates some  phenotypes of an rpoe null mutant and the psp genes of s. enterica and shigella flexneri are highly induced during macrophage infection. pspa, the most abundant  of the psp proteins, is required for most of the phenotypes associated with the psp system. therefore, pspa is probably an effector that may play a role in maintaining cytoplasmic membrane integrity and/or the proton-motive force. however, pspa is not required for the ability to tolerate secretin mislocalization, which suggests an important physiological role for other psp proteins. this article summarizes our current understanding of the psp system: inducing signals, the underlying signal transduction mechanisms, the physiological roles it may play, and a genomic analysis of its conservation.

TI  == comparative genomics of the kdgr regulon in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  == in the plant-pathogenic enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi, almost all known genes involved in pectin catabolism are controlled by the transcriptional regulator kdgr. in this study, the comparative genomics approach was used to analyse the kdgr regulon in completely sequenced genomes of eight enterobacteria, including erw. chrysanthemi, and two vibrio species. application of a signal recognition procedure complemented by operon structure and protein sequence analysis allowed identification of new candidate genes of the kdgr regulon. most  of these genes were found to be controlled by the camp-receptor protein, a global regulator of catabolic genes. at the next step, regulation of these genes in erw. chrysanthemi was experimentally verified using in vivo transcriptional fusions and an attempt was made to clarify the functional role of the predicted genes in  pectin catabolism. interestingly, it was found that the kdgr protein, previously  known as a repressor, positively regulates expression of two new members of the regulon, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene ppsa and an adjacent gene, ydia, of unknown function. other predicted regulon members, namely chmx, dhfx, gntb, pykf, spix, sota, tpfx, yeeo and yjgk, were found to be subject to classical negative regulation by kdgr. possible roles of newly identified members of the erw. chrysanthemi kdgr regulon, chmx, dhfx, gntdbmnac, spix, tpfx, ydia, yeeo, ygjv and yjgk, in pectin catabolism are discussed. finally, complete reconstruction of the kdgr regulons in various gamma-proteobacteria yielded a metabolic map reflecting a globally conserved pathway for the catabolism of pectin and its derivatives with variability in transport and enzymic capabilities among species. in particular, possible non-orthologous substitutes of isomerase kdui and a new oligogalacturonide transporter in the vibrio species were detected.

AB  == a 27-year-old female lowland gorilla developed an asymmetric oligoarthritis 3 months post-partum. there was no evidence of an antecedent gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. serum was negative for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody. synovial fluid revealed 2000 white blood cells with negative cultures and polarized microscopy. studies on synoviocytes were the following: (1) facs analysis revealed surface expression of a b27-like epitope of the cells. (2) analysis of intracellular clearance kinetics of arthritogenic organisms showed peak intracellular colony-forming units at 48 hours after bacterial invasion, and clearance by 13 days post-invasion. (3) interferon-y (0.1-10.0 ng/ml)accelerated  intracellular microbicidal pathways in a dose-dependent fashion. these findings closely parallel those seen in human synoviocytes of patients with spondyloarthropathy. primate and human seronegative arthritis share clinical and  immunologic features, as well as aspects of host:pathogen defense mechanisms. the interplay of genetic and microbial factors underlying this arthritis appears to be conserved across these species boundaries.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica leads to transient induction of tnf-alpha and activates nf-kappab in synovial fibroblasts.
AB  == objective: the importance of the presence of bacterial antigen or even living bacteria for the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis has been discussed increasingly ever since bacterial antigen was found in inflamed joints. bacteria  may persist in the body and drive the local immune response, maintaining arthritis. cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) are essential for bacterial elimination. in reactive arthritis, the course of the disease is influenced by several cytokines, including tnf-alpha. tnf-alpha expression can be mediated by transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab). moreover, tnf-alpha is also one of the strongest activators of nf-kappab. methods: in vitro expression of tnf-alpha and activation of nf-kappab  in synovial fibroblasts after infection with yersinia enterocolitica or salmonella enteritidis was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, western blot assay and real-time pcr. results: we found that infection of synovial fibroblasts with yersinia and salmonellae lead to the transient expression of tnf-alpha mrna and induction of nf-kappab. conclusion: induction of tnf-alpha in synovial fibroblasts after infection with yersiniae or salmonellae might be insufficient to eliminate bacteria, and this could allow the intracellular persistence of these bacteria. our results therefore support the hypothesis that a permissive cytokine pattern might contribute to the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis.

AB  == the transcriptional enhancer protein rfah positively regulates production of virulence factors in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium via a cis element, ops. genes coding for rfah orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including vibrio and yersinia spp. we cloned the rfah genes from vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae into e. coli expression vectors. purified rfah orthologs, including the most divergent one from v. cholerae, were readily recruited to the e. coli transcription elongation complex. postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to e. coli rfah. v. cholerae rfah was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. when overexpressed episomally, all of the rfah genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the e. coli gene. thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the rfah proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the e. coli system.

TI  == the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 interferes with invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by different enteroinvasive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 (mutaflor) of serotype o6:k5:h1 was reported to protect gnotobiotic piglets from infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. an important virulence property of salmonella is invasion of host epithelial cells. therefore, we tested for interference of e. coli strain nissle 1917 with salmonella invasion of int407 cells. simultaneous administration of e. coli strain nissle 1917 and salmonella resulted in up to 70% reduction of salmonella invasion efficiency. furthermore, invasion of yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, legionella pneumophila and even of listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by the probiotic e. coli strain nissle 1917 without  affecting the viability of the invasive bacteria. the observed inhibition of invasion was not due to the production of microcins by the nissle 1917 strain because its isogenic microcin-negative mutant sk22d was as effective as the parent strain. reduced invasion rates were also achieved if strain nissle 1917 was separated from the invasive bacteria as well as from the int407 monolayer by  a membrane non-permeable for bacteria. we conclude e. coli nissle 1917 to interfere with bacterial invasion of int407 cells via a secreted component and not relying on direct physical contact with either the invasive bacteria or the epithelial cells.

TI  == inhibition of foodborne bacteria by the lactoperoxidase system in a beef cube system.
AB  == biopreservatives are being developed to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens and thus improve food safety. the lactoperoxidase system (lps) is a naturally occurring system that has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in foods. growth of single strains of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa and beef microflora were assessed on lps-treated meat surfaces in an experimental system.  beef cubes inoculated with approximately 10(4) cfu cm(-2) of bacteria were treated with the lps and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 12 degrees c for 7 days or in a chilling regime: 12 to -1 degrees c over 1 week and held at -1 degrees c for 4 weeks. treatment with lps was more effective at storage temperatures non-permissive for rapid bacterial growth with strong inhibition of  growth achieved on lps-treated cubes at 12 degrees c and reduction in pathogen viable counts at chilling temperatures. at chilling temperatures, the lps inhibited the growth of native pseudomonads but did not prevent the development of native lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == bubonic and pneumonic plague are caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis. the v antigen of y. pestis is a protective antigen against plague. in this study, an aroa attenuated strain of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (sl3261) has been used to deliver the y. pestis v antigen as a candidate oral plague vaccine.  sl3261 was transformed with the expression plasmid ptrc-lcrv, containing the lcrv gene encoding v antigen. immunoblot analysis showed v antigen expression in sl3261 in vitro and intragastric immunisation of mice with the recombinant salmonella resulted in the induction of v antigen-specific serum antibody responses and afforded protection against y. pestis challenge. however, the antibody responses induced by the recombinant salmonella did not correlate with the protection afforded, indicating that immune responses other than antibody may play a role in the protection afforded against plague by this candidate vaccine.

TI  == autodisplay: development of an efficacious system for surface display of antigenic determinants in salmonella vaccine strains.
AB  == to optimize antigen delivery by salmonella vaccine strains, a system for surface  display of antigenic determinants was established by using the autotransporter secretion pathway of gram-negative bacteria. a modular system for surface display allowed effective targeting of heterologous antigens or fragments thereof to the  bacterial surface by the autotransporter domain of aida-i, the escherichia coli adhesin involved in diffuse adherence. a major histocompatibility complex class ii-restricted epitope, comprising amino acids 74 to 86 of the yersinia enterocolitica heat shock protein hsp60 (hsp60(74-86)), was fused to the aida-i autotransporter domain, and the resulting fusion protein was expressed at high levels on the cell surface of e. coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. colonization studies in mice vaccinated with salmonella strains expressing aida-i fusion proteins demonstrated high genetic stability of the generated vaccine strain in vivo. furthermore, a pronounced t-cell response against yersinia hsp60(74-86) was induced in mice vaccinated with a salmonella vaccine strain expressing the hsp60(74-86)-aida-i fusion protein. this was shown  by monitoring yersinia hsp60-stimulated ifn-gamma secretion and proliferation of  splenic t cells isolated from vaccinated mice. these results demonstrate that the surface display of antigenic determinants by the autotransporter pathway deserves special attention regarding the application in live attenuated salmonella vaccine strains.

AB  == objective: to define the candidate bacterial trigger and cytokine profile of synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) in patients with sporadic enteric reactive arthritis (rea) and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (uspa). methods: the study group comprised 10 patients with rea and 23 with uspa who fulfilled european spondylarthropathy study group criteria. ten patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) served as disease controls. igg, iga, and igm antibodies to shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were measured in sera and sf by elisa. peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) and sfmc proliferation assays were done in the presence or absence of crude bacterial lysates. bacterial antigens and dna in synovial cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. interferon-g (ifn-g), interleukin 10 (il-10), and il-4 were measured in 18 h sfmc culture supernatants in presence of bacterial lysate. results: antibodies to s. typhimurium were significantly elevated in the sera of  8 of 25 patients compared to controls (0/22; p < 0.05). the ratio of sf:serum anti-salmonella iga was significantly higher in patients compared to controls (p  < 0.0002). the ratio of sf:serum iga antibodies to s. typhimurium was higher than that for s. flexneri (p < 0.007) and y. enterocolitica (p < 0.05). out of 25 patients, 8, 2, and none had elevated antigen-specific sfmc proliferation response to s. typhimurium, s. flexneri, and y. enterocolitica, respectively, whereas no control had elevated response. salmonella antigens were detected in the synovial cells of 4 out of 14 patients. there was significantly higher ifn-g  production from sfmc of patients who had increased proliferative response to salmonella (ltt+) in the presence of salmonella antigens compared to antigen control. the mean +/- sd of the ratio of ifn-g:il-10 in the ltt+ patients was significantly lower compared to controls. conclusion. s. typhimurium is probably  one of the triggers for enteric rea and uspa in our cohort of patients, and the immune response is characterized by increased production of both il-10 and ifn-g.

TI  == identification of substrates and chaperone from the yersinia enterocolitica 1b ysa type iii secretion system.
AB  == all pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica strains carry the pyv plasmid encoding the ysc-yop type iii secretion (tts) system, which operates at 37 degrees c. in addition, biovar 1b y. enterocolitica strains possess a second, chromosomally encoded, tts system called ysa, which operates, at least in vitro, under low-temperature and high-salt (lths) conditions. six open reading frames, sycb, yspb, yspc, yspd, yspa, and acpy, neighbor the ysa genes encoding the ysa tts apparatus. here we show that yspa, yspb, yspc, and yspd are secreted by the ysa tts system under lths conditions. sycb is a chaperone for yspb and yspc and stabilizes yspb. yspb, yspc, and sycb share some similarity with tts substrates and the chaperone encoded by the mxi-spa locus of shigella flexneri and spi-1 of  salmonella enterica. in addition, ysa also secretes the pyv-encoded yope under lths conditions, indicating that yope is a potential effector of both y. enterocolitica tts systems. yspc could also be secreted by s. flexneri, but no functional complementation of ipac was observed, which indicates that despite their similarity the ysa and the mxi-spa systems are not interchangeable. when expressed from the yope promoter, yspb and yspc could also be secreted via the ysc injectisome. however, they could not form detectable pores in eukaryotic target cells and could not substitute for yopb and yopd for translocation of yop  effectors.

TI  == detection of a novel repeated sequence useful for epidemiological typing of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == strains (n = 203) of yersinia species were used in genotyping and pcr experiments in order to evaluate the genotyping potential of the yeo:3rs probe. this probe comprises a 12.5 kb genomic fragment of the y. enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide o-antigen gene cluster cloned into plasmid pbr322. the genotyping potential of yeo:3rs was shown to reside in the region upstream of the o-antigen gene cluster, i.e., in the first 1.65 kb of the cloned genomic fragment that contains a repeated sequence (rs) present in multiple copies in the genome.  in genotyping, the yeo:3rs probe was hybridised to dna of yersinia enterocolitica isolates (n = 112) from humans, animals and food, along with strains of other yersinia species (n = 5) and salmonella enterica strains (n = 3). the yeo:3rs probe efficiently detected and subtyped all european pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica isolates of the serobiotypes o:3/4, o:9/2 and o:5,27/2 studied (n  = 87), whereas it hybridised only weakly or not at all with the other strains. within yersinia enterocolitica serobiotype o:3/4 strains, yeo:3rs genotyping was  as discriminatory as genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of xbai-noti digested genomic dna. when these two methods were combined, yeo:3rs genotyping divided both of the two predominant pfge types into six subtypes, thus increasing the discrimination. in pcr screening of additional 86 yersinia strains, the 1.65 kb region was detected in european pathogenic serotypes o:1 and o:2 in addition to serotypes o:3, o:5,27 and o:9, indicating that it can be exploited in detecting and typing of european pathogenic serotypes in general.

TI  == interaction of human hematopoietic stem cells with bacterial pathogens.
AB  == primitive hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) in the bone marrow are rare pluripotent cells with the capacity to give rise to all lineages of blood cells. during commitment, progenitor cells are composed mainly of cells with the potential for  differentiation into 1 or 2 lineages. this commitment involves the acquisition of specific growth factor receptors and the loss of others. viral and bacterial infections may lead to profound disturbance of hematopoiesis, which is possibly due to different susceptibility of hscs to infectious agents. here, we show that  quiescent human hscs are fully resistant to infection by the intracellular bacteria, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enterica serovariation typhimurium, and the extracellular pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. during myeloid/monocytic differentiation induced by incubation with stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, and flt-3 ligand, partially differentiated hscs emerge, which readily take up these pathogens and also latex beads by macropinocytosis. after further monocytic differentiation, bacterial uptake by macropinocytosis still occurs but internalization of the pathogens is now mainly achieved by receptor-mediated phagocytosis. these results suggest that in the case of hscs uptake mechanisms for bacteria develop sequentially.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide desensitization of macrophages provides protection against yersinia enterocolitica-induced apoptosis.
AB  == pathogenic yersinia spp. uncouple an array of signal transduction pathways in macrophages to disrupt their response to infection. this compels the macrophage to undergo apoptosis. our study shows that macrophages that had acquired tolerance to yersinia infection by preexposure to lipopolysaccharide were considerably protected against y. enterocolitica-induced apoptosis. the desensitization of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide, which is thought to be a self-protective, adaptive response to sustained bacterial stimulation, may represent an immune mechanism that aids in overcoming yersinia-mediated apoptosis and infection.

TI  == characterization of the ysa pathogenicity locus in the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica and phylogeny analysis of type iii secretion systems.
AB  == several gram negative bacteria use a complex system called "type iii secretion system" (ttss) to engage their host. the archetype of ttss is the plasmid-encoded "yop virulon" shared by the three species of pathogenic yersinia (y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica). a second ttss, called ysa (for yersinia secretion apparatus) was recently described in y. enterocolitica 8081, a strain from serotype o:8. in this study, we describe the ysa locus from a127/90,  another strain of serotype o:8, and we extend the sequence to several new genes encoding ysp proteins which are the substrates of this secretion system, and a putative chaperone sycb. according to the deduced protein sequences, the ysa system from a127/90 is identical to that of 8081. it is different from the chromosome-encoded ttss of y. pestis but is instead closely related to the mxi-spa ttss of shigella and to the spi-1 encoded ttss of salmonella enterica. we further demonstrated that the ysa locus is only present in biotype ib strains of  y. enterocolitica. including this new ysa system, a phylogenetic analysis of the  26 known ttsss was carried out, based on the sequence analysis of three conserved proteins. all the ttsss fall into five different clusters. the phylogenetic tree  of these ttsss is completely different from the evolutionary tree based on 16s rna, indicating that ttsss have been distributed by horizontal transfer.

TI  == neutrophil elastase targets virulence factors of enterobacteria.
AB  == shigellae cause bacillary dysentery, a bloody form of diarrhoea that affects almost 200 million people and causes nearly 2 million deaths per year. shigella invades the colonic mucosa, where it initiates an acute inflammation, rich in neutrophils, that initially contributes to tissue damage and eventually resolves  the infection. neutrophils are phagocytic cells that kill microorganisms but it is unclear how neutrophils control pathogenic bacteria expressing virulence factors that manipulate host cells. in contrast to other cells, neutrophils prevent the escape of shigella from phagocytic vacuoles in which the bacteria are killed. here we identify human neutrophil elastase (ne) as a key host defence protein: ne degrades shigella virulence factors at a 1,000-fold lower concentration than that needed to degrade other bacterial proteins. in neutrophils in which ne is inactivated pharmacologically or genetically, shigella escapes from phagosomes, increasing bacterial survival. ne also preferentially cleaves virulence factors of salmonella and yersinia. these findings establish ne as the first neutrophil factor that targets bacterial virulence proteins.

AB  == although helicobacter pylori has generally been considered an extracellular pathogen, a number of in vitro infection experiments and biopsy examinations have shown that it is capable of occasionally entering mammalian host cells. here, we  characterized this entry process by using ags cells as a host cell model. in gentamicin protection-invasion assays, the number of h. pylori colonies recovered was lower than that for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium x22, escherichia  coli expressing inva, and yersinia enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 25 degrees c but  higher than that for neisseria gonorrhoeae vp1 and y. enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 37 degrees c. at the ultrastructural level, the entry process was observed to  occur via a zipper-like mechanism. internalized h. pylori was bound in tight lamp-1-containing vacuoles in close association with condensed filamentous actin  and tyrosine phosphorylation signals. wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calphostin c, an inhibitor of protein kinase c, both inhibited the entry of h. pylori in a sensitive and dose-dependent manner; however, the level of entry was enhanced by sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases and atpases. furthermore, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonized the entry of h. pylori into ags cells. collectively, these results demonstrate that the entry of h. pylori into ags cells occurs via a zipper-like mechanism which involves various host signal transduction events.

TI  == efficient insertion mutagenesis strategy for bacterial genomes involving electroporation of in vitro-assembled dna transposition complexes of bacteriophage mu.
AB  == an efficient insertion mutagenesis strategy for bacterial genomes based on the phage mu dna transposition reaction was developed. incubation of mua transposase  protein with artificial mini-mu transposon dna in the absence of divalent cations in vitro resulted in stable but inactive mu dna transposition complexes, or transpososomes. following delivery into bacterial cells by electroporation, the complexes were activated for dna transposition chemistry after encountering divalent metal ions within the cells. mini-mu transposons were integrated into bacterial chromosomes with efficiencies ranging from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/microg of input transposon dna in the four species tested, i.e., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and yersinia enterocolitica. efficiency of integration was influenced mostly by the competence status of a given strain or batch of bacteria. an accurate 5-bp target site duplication flanking the transposon, a hallmark of mu transposition, was generated upon mini-mu integration into the genome, indicating that a genuine dna transposition reaction was reproduced within the cells of the bacteria studied. this insertion mutagenesis strategy for microbial genomes may be applicable to a  variety of organisms provided that a means to introduce dna into their cells is available.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  == interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. however, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. the induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. nf(kappa)b or map-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the  infected cell. host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. however, in some infections, apoptosis of  mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.

TI  == unusual molecular architecture of the yersinia pestis cytotoxin yopm: a leucine-rich repeat protein with the shortest repeating unit.
AB  == many gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ a contact-dependent (type iii) secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of animal or plant cells. collectively, these effectors enable the bacteria to evade the immune response of the infected organism by modulating host-cell functions. yopm, a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein superfamily, is an effector produced by the bubonic plague bacterium, yersinia pestis, that is essential for virulence. here, we report crystal structures of yopm at 2.4 and 2.1 a resolution. among all leucine-rich repeat family members whose atomic coordinates have been reported, the repeating unit of yopm has the least canonical secondary structure. in both crystals, four yopm monomers form a hollow cylinder with an inner diameter of 35  a. the domain that targets yopm for translocation into eukaryotic cells adopts a  well-ordered, alpha-helical conformation that packs tightly against the proximal  leucine-rich repeat module. a similar alpha-helical domain can be identified in virulence-associated leucine-rich repeat proteins produced by salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri, and in the conceptual translation products of  several open reading frames in y. pestis.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the escherichia coli tus protein: dna-protein interactions alone can not account for tus activity.
AB  == the tus protein of escherichia coli is capable of arresting dna replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called ter sites. arrest of dna replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between tus and some component of the replication fork. a previous mutational analysis of tus suggested that the amino acids in the l1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the l1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of tus was performed to identify residues that affected tus function. one mutant, e47q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the ter site  (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type tus) but a reduced ability  to arrest dna replication in vivo. in addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of salmonella, klebsiella, and yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in e. coli to assess their ability to arrest dna replication. the results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in tus function, and suggest that residues e47 and e49 participate in replication fork arrest.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == evaluation of thin agar layer method for recovery of acid-injured foodborne pathogens.
AB  == the thin agar layer (tal) method of kang and fung was used to enumerate acid-injured foodborne pathogens. this method involves overlaying 14 ml of nonselective medium (tryptic soy agar [tsa]) onto a prepoured and solidified pathogen-specific, selective medium in a petri dish. after surface plating, injured cells resuscitated and grew on tsa during the first few hours of incubation; then, the selective agents from the selective medium diffused to the  top layer, interacted with the recovered microorganisms, and started to produce typical reactions. foodborne pathogens were exposed to 2% acetic acid for 1, 2, or 4 min, and the recovery rate with the tal method was compared with the rate of tsa and pathogen-specific, selective media. no significant difference occurred between tsa and tal (p > 0.05) for enumeration of acid-injured escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica, and both recovered significantly higher numbers than the selective medium for each respective pathogen (p < 0.05). for recovery of acid-injured listeria monocytogenes, no difference (p > 0.05) occurred among tsa, tal, and selective media. however, fewer cells were recovered in the selective media. the tal method is a one-step, convenient procedure for recovery of acid-injured cells.

TI  == genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == antibodies against listerial protein 60 act as an opsonin for phagocytosis of listeria monocytogenes by human dendritic cells.
AB  == human-monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modc) are very efficient in the uptake of listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive bacterium which is an important pathogen  in humans and animals causing systemic infections with symptoms such as septicemia and meningitis. in this work, we analyzed the influence of blood plasma on the internalization of l. monocytogenes into human modc and compared the uptake of l. monocytogenes with that of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica. while human plasma did not significantly influence the uptake of serovar typhimurium and y. enterocolitica by human modc,  the efficiency of the uptake of l. monocytogenes by these phagocytes was strongly enhanced by human plasma. in plasma-free medium the internalization of l. monocytogenes was very low, whereas the addition of pooled human immunoglobulins  resulted in the internalization of these bacteria to a degree comparable to the highly efficient uptake observed with human plasma. all human plasma tested contained antibodies against the 60-kda extracellular protein of l. monocytogenes (p60), and anti-p60 antibodies were also found in the commercially available pooled immunoglobulins. strikingly, in contrast to l. monocytogenes wild type, an iap deletion mutant (totally deficient in p60) showed only a minor difference in  the uptake by human modc in the presence or the absence of human plasma. these results support the assumption that antibodies against the listerial p60 protein  may play an important role in fc-receptor-mediated uptake of l. monocytogenes by  human modc via opsonization of the bacteria. this process may have a major impact in preventing systemic infection in l. monocytogenes in immunocompetent humans.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == yersinia outer protein p of yersinia enterocolitica simultaneously blocks the nuclear factor-kappa b pathway and exploits lipopolysaccharide signaling to trigger apoptosis in macrophages.
AB  == exposure of macrophages to bacteria or lps mediates activation of signaling pathways that induce expression of self defense-related genes. pathogenic yersinia species impair activation of transcription factor nf-kappab and trigger  apoptosis in macrophages. in this study, we dissected the mechanism of apoptosis  induction by yersinia. selectively, yersinia enterocolitica strains producing the effector protein yersinia outer protein p (yopp) hampered nf-kappab activation and subsequently conferred apoptosis to j774a.1 macrophages. thereby, yopp bound  and inhibited the macrophage nf-kappab-activating kinase ikkbeta. yopp- and yersinia-, but not salmonella-induced apoptosis was specifically prevented by transient overexpression of nf-kappab p65, giving evidence that yopp mediates cell death by disrupting the nf-kappab signaling pathway. transfection of j774a.1 macrophages with yopp induced a moderate, but significant degree of apoptosis (40-50% of transfected cells). this effect was strongly enhanced by additional initiation of lps signaling (80-90%), indicating a synergism between lps-induced  signal transduction and inhibition of nf-kappab by yopp. this reflects a strategy of a bacterial pathogen that takes advantage of lps, serving as cofactor, to impair the macrophage.

AB  == growth of the pathogens yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and strains of salmonella were compared in ground beef packed in modified atmospheres of 60% co2/40% n2/0.4% co (high co2/low co mixture), 70% o2/30% co2 (high o2 mixture) and in chub packs (stuffed in plastic  casings). the ground beef was inoculated with rifampicin-resistant or nalidixic acid/streptomycin-resistant strains of the pathogens (final concentration 10(2) - 10(3) bacteria/g) and stored at 4 and 10 degrees c for up to 14 days. at 4 degrees c the shelf life, based on colour stability and background flora development, was prolonged for the high co2/low co mixture compared to the two other packaging methods, but at 10 degrees c the shelf life was < 8 days for all  the packaging methods. growth of y. enterocolitica was nearly totally inhibited both at 4 and 10 degrees c in the high co2/low co mixture, while the bacterial numbers in the samples packed in the high o2 mixture increased from about 5 x 10(2) bacteria/g at day 0 to about 10(4) at day 5 at 4 degrees c and to 10(5) at  10 degrees c. growth in the chub packs was even higher. l. monocytogenes showed very little growth at 4 degrees c in all treatments. at 10 degrees c there was slow growth from about 5 x 10(3) bacteria/g to about 10(4) at day 5 in the high co2/low co mixture, while the numbers in the high o2 mixture and the chub packs were about 10 times higher. growth of e. coli o157:h7 at 10 degrees c in the ground beef was nearly totally inhibited in both the high co2/low co mixture and  the high o2 mixture. growth in the chub packs was higher, as the number of bacteria increased 3 log in 5 days. the salmonella strains (s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. enteritidis and s. enterica 61:k:1,5,(7)) in the ground beef stored at 10 degrees c for 5 and 7 days grew to a higher number in the high co2/low co mixture than in the high o2 mixture. this study shows that the growth of y. enterocolitica and l. mononcytogenes in ground beef stored in the high co2 /low co mixture was not increased as a result of prolonging the shelf life. however, the observed growth of strains of salmonella at 10 degrees c in this mixture and  in chub packs does emphasise the importance of temperature control during storage.

TI  == delivery of protein antigens and dna by virulence-attenuated strains of salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == two different plasmid-vector systems were developed which allow the efficient production and presentation of protein antigens in antigen-presenting cells (apc) by means of virulence-attenuated bacteria. the first antigen-delivery system is based on the secretion machinery of the escherichia coli hemolysin (hlya-type i secretion system), which transports proteins, possessing the specific hlya secretion signal (hlya(s)) at the c-terminus, across both membranes of gram-negative bacteria. this system functions in all gram-negative bacteria that  possess the tolc-analogous protein in the outer membrane. this outer membrane protein is necessary for the stable anchoring of the type i secretion apparatus in the cell envelope. suitable hlya(s)-fused antigens are secreted with high efficiency by e. coli and by virulence-attenuated strains of salmonella, shigella, vibrio cholerae and yersinia enterocolitica. the other vector system expresses the heterologous antigen under the control of an eukaryotic promoter in a similar fashion as in plasmids commonly used for vaccination with naked dna. this plasmid dna is introduced into apcs with the help of virulence-attenuated self-destructing listeria monocytogenes mutants. after synthesis of the heterologous protein, epitopes of the antigen are presented by the apc together with mhc class i molecules. this system functions in macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro and can also be used in a modified form in animal models.

AB  == the use of a rapid surface adhesion immunofluorescent (saif) technique for the isolation of three pathogens using a single enrichment step from broth and enriched meat cultures was investigated. buffered peptone water (bpw, 225 ml) was inoculated with listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis and yersinia enterocolitica to a level of 10 cfu ml(-1) and incubated overnight at 30 degrees  c. minced beef samples (25 g) were inoculated with the three pathogens to a level of 100 cfu g(-1) and incubated overnight at 30 degrees c in bpw (225 ml). pathogens were isolated by surface adhesion to a polycarbonate membrane which was immersed in the enriched culture. the pathogens were detected using membrane counts (rinse and immunofluorescent) and standard plate counts. it was noted that the attachment of the three pathogens to the membrane was considerably enhanced when compared with single inoculum experiments and the reasons and implications of this for the rapid method are discussed. a small selection of naturally contaminated retail samples (n = 60) was tested for the presence of l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis using a simultaneous enrichment step with saif detection and a standard cultural method of detection. a good correlation was found between both methods for l. monocytogenes (r2 = 0.91, rsd = 0.26) and s. enteritidis (r2 = 0.89, rsd = 0.28). this indicates that simultaneous analysis of these two pathogens could be carried out using the saif assay.

TI  == extraintestinal dissemination of salmonella by cd18-expressing phagocytes.
AB  == specialized epithelia known as m cells overlying the lymphoid follicles of peyer's patches are important in the mucosal immune system, but also provide a portal of entry for pathogens such as salmonella typhimurium, mycobacterium bovis, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica and reoviruses. penetration of  intestinal m cells and epithelial cells by salmonella typhimurium requires the invasion genes of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (spi1). spi1-deficient s. typhimurium strains gain access to the spleen following oral administration and cause lethal infection in mice without invading m cells or localizing in peyer's  patches, which indicates that salmonella uses an alternative strategy to disseminate from the gastrointestinal tract. here we report that salmonella is transported from the gastrointestinal tract to the bloodstream by cd18-expressing phagocytes, and that cd18-deficient mice are resistant to dissemination of salmonella to the liver and spleen after oral administration. this cd18-dependent pathway of extraintestinal dissemination may be important for the development of  systemic immunity to gastrointestinal pathogens, because oral challenge with spi1-deficient s. typhimurium elicits a specific systemic igg humoral immune response, despite an inability to stimulate production of specific mucosal iga.

AB  == cistern-collected rain water which is used as process water for toilet flushing,  cleaning purposes, garden irrigation and linen washing, was experimentally contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, salmonella enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni. the longevity of those pathogens was investigated considering different temperatures and contents of organic materials. neither salmonella enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica nor campylobacter jejuni are able to grow at temperatures of 5 degrees c, 15 degrees  c, 20 degrees c or 37 degrees c. the most sensitive pathogen was campylobacter jejuni which showed rapidly decreasing of colony counts at 15 degrees c as compared with yersinia enterocolitica or salmonella enteritidis. for salmonella enteritidis the decrease of bacterial concentrations was higher at 37 degrees c than at 5 degrees c. increasing the concentrations of organic compounds by addition of bacteriological pepton or addition of extreme++ amounts of pidgeon feces lowers the rate of bacterial death but an increase in colony counts could not be observed at the different temperatures investigated. the elimination of salmonella is supported if the cisterns are layered with a biofilm and sediment.  so it could be confirmed, that raised amounts of organic material, pidgeon feces  together with optimal temperatures which can be observed accidentally in rain water cisterns can not enhance growth of enteropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == ubiquicidin, a novel murine microbicidal protein present in the cytosolic fraction of macrophages.
AB  == previously we have identified and characterized three murine microbicidal proteins purified from the granule fraction of cells from the murine macrophage cell line raw264.7. during these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional antimicrobial protein in the cytosolic fraction of raw264.7 cells that had been activated with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). in this study we have purified this protein, designated ubiquicidin, to apparent homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a cationic, small (mr 6654) protein. ubiquicidin displayed marked antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that  the protein also displays activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and an avirulent strain of yersinia enterocolitica. aminoterminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of purified ubiquicidin indicated  that it is most likely identical to the ribosomal protein s30. this protein is produced by posttranslational processing of the fau protein, a 133-amino-acid fusion protein consisting of s30 linked to an unusual peptide with significant homology to ubiquitin. the fau gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in humans and various animal species. the presence of ubiquicidin in the cytosol of macrophages may serve to restrict the intracellular growth of microorganisms. in addition, because macrophage disintegration will likely lead to release of ubiquicidin into the extracellular environment, it may  contribute to host defense after macrophage death.

AB  == major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i expression is reduced in several viral infections, but it is not known whether the same happens during infections  caused by intracellular enterobacteria. in this study, the expression of mhc class i antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from 16 patients with salmonella, yersinia, or klebsiella infection was investigated. during or after the acute infection, the expression of mhc class i antigens was markedly decreased in eight patients, all with genotype hla-b27, and six out of eight with reactive arthritis (rea). a significant decrease of monomorphic mhc class i was found in three patients, of hla-b27 in eight (p<0.05) and of hla-a2 in two. however, patients negative for the hla-b27 genotype, or healthy hla-b27-positive  individuals, did not have a significant decrease of mhc class i antigens. during  the decreased expression on the cell surface, intracellular retention of mhc class i antigens was observed, whereas hla-b27 mrna levels did not vary significantly. this is the first evidence that enterobacterial infection may down-regulate expression of mhc class i molecules in vivo and that down-regulation is predominant in patients with the hla-b27 genotype.

TI  == invf is required for expression of genes encoding proteins secreted by the spi1 type iii secretion apparatus in salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == the expression of genes encoding proteins secreted by the spi1 (salmonella pathogenicity island) type iii secretion apparatus is known to require the transcriptional activators sira and hila. however, neither sira nor hila is believed to directly activate the promoters of these genes. invf, the first gene  of the inv-spa gene cluster, is predicted to encode an arac-type transcriptional  activator and is required for invasion into cultured epithelial cells. however, the genes which are regulated by invf have not been identified. in this work, an  in-frame deletion in invf was constructed and tested for the expression of phi(sigd-laczya), sipc::tn5laczy, and a plasmid-encoded phi(sica-laczya). sigd (salmonella invasion gene) is a secreted protein required for the efficient invasion of salmonella typhimurium into cultured eucaryotic cells. sica (salmonella invasion chaperone) is the first gene of a putative operon encoding the sip/ssp (salmonella invasion/salmonella secreted proteins) invasion proteins  secreted by the spi1 type iii export apparatus. invf was required for the expression of the sigd, sica, and sipc fusions. this is the first demonstration that there is a functional promoter in the intergenic sequence between spas and sica. in addition, several proteins were either absent from or found in reduced amounts in the culture supernatants of the invf mutant. therefore, invf is required for the optimal expression of several genes encoding spi1-secreted proteins. genetic evidence is also presented suggesting there is hila-dependent readthrough transcription from the invf promoter at least through sipc.

TI  == differential regulation of salmonella typhimurium type iii secreted proteins by pathogenicity island 1 (spi-1)-encoded transcriptional activators invf and hila.
AB  == salmonella enterica encodes a type iii protein secretion system within a pathogenicity island (spi-1) that is located at centisome 63 of its chromosome. this system is required for the ability of these bacteria to stimulate cellular responses that are essential for their pathogenicity. expression of components and substrates of this system is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms. these  mechanisms involve the function of hila and invf, two transcriptional regulatory  proteins encoded within spi-1. in this study, we examined the functional relationship between these two regulatory proteins. we found that strains carrying loss-of-function mutations in either hila or invf differ in their ability to stimulate cellular responses. an s. typhimurium hila mutant strain retained considerable signaling capacity that resulted in significant levels of internalization into host cells. in contrast, introduction of a nonpolar loss-of-function mutation in invf rendered s. typhimurium significantly impaired  in its ability to enter host cells. consistent with these different phenotypes, we found that hila and invf control the expression of different genes. hila regulates the expression of components of the type iii secretion machinery, whereas invf controls the expression of type iii secreted proteins encoded outside of spi-1. we also found that the expression of secreted proteins encoded  within spi-1 are under the control of both hila and invf. our results therefore indicate that invf and hila differentially control the expression of components and substrates of the invasion-associated type iii secretion system.

TI  == functional expression of nramp1 in vitro in the murine macrophage line raw264.7.
AB  == mutations at the nramp1 locus in vivo cause susceptibility to infection by unrelated intracellular microbes. nramp1 encodes an integral membrane protein abundantly expressed in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment of macrophages and is recruited to the phagosomal membrane following phagocytosis. the mechanism by which nramp1 affects the biochemical properties of the phagosome to control microbial replication is unknown. to devise an in vitro assay for nramp1 function, we introduced a wild-type nramp1(g169) cdna into raw 264.7 macrophages  (which bear a homozygous mutant nramp1(d169) allele and thus are permissive to replication of specific intracellular parasites). recombinant nramp1 was expressed in a membranous compartment in raw264.7 cells and was recruited to the  membrane of salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica containing phagosomes. evaluation of the antibacterial activity of raw264.7 transfectants showed that expression of the recombinant nramp1 protein abrogated intracellular  replication of s. typhimurium. studies with a replication-defective s. typhimurium mutant suggest that this occurs through an enhanced bacteriostatic activity. the effect of nramp1 expression was specific, since (i) it was not seen in raw264.7 transfectants overexpressing the closely related nramp2 protein, and  (ii) control raw264.7 cells, nramp1, and nramp2 transfectants could all efficiently kill a temperature-sensitive, replication-defective mutant of s. typhimurium. finally, increased antibacterial activity of the nramp1 raw264.7 transfectants was linked to increased phagosomal acidification, a distinguishing  feature of primary macrophages expressing a wild-type nramp1 allele. together, these results indicate that transfection of nramp1 cdnas in the raw264.7 macrophage cell line can be used as a direct assay to study both nramp1 function  and mechanism of action as well as to identify structure-function relationships in this protein.

AB  == shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the  pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the  mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase  expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the  organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.

TI  == hla-b27 does not affect invasion of arthritogenic bacteria into human cells.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of hla-b27 expression on entry of salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica into human cells. methods: we performed standard bacterial invasion assays with s. typhimurium and y enterocolitica to analyze isogenic pairs of hela (epithelial), u937 (promonocyte), c1r (b lymphocyte), and jurkat (t lymphocyte) human cell lines and their respective hla-b27 transfectants. invasion of peripheral blood derived t lymphocytes, monocytes, and b lymphocytes/dendritic cell fraction (corresponding to peripheral blood cells depleted of monocytes and t lymphocytes) from patients with ankylosing spondylitis and healthy donors was also analyzed. the percentage of internalized bacteria was quantified, and the differences between hla-b27 positive and negative samples were compared. results: the percentages of intracellular s. typhimurium and y enterocolitica in hela, u937, and c1r with or  without b27 were not statistically different (independent t test). we also found  that the percentage of internalized bacteria did not differ significantly between hla-b27 positive and negative samples in the different populations of peripheral  blood derived cells. conclusion: the presence of hla-b27 on the surface of human  cells does not alter the degree of bacterial invasion into either cultured human  cell lines or peripheral blood derived human cells, and the influence of hla-b27  expression on bacterial invasion should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of  reactive arthritis related to salmonella and yersinia.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to  the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt  starters.

TI  == the regulated outer membrane protein omp21 from comamonas acidovorans is identified as a member of a new family of eight-stranded beta-sheet proteins by its sequence and properties.
AB  == omp21, a minor outer membrane protein of the soil bacterium comamonas acidovorans, was purified from a spontaneous mutant lacking a surface layer and long-chain lipopolysaccharide. omp21 synthesis is enhanced by oxygen depletion, and the protein has a variable electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis due to its heat-modifiable behavior. the structural gene omp21 encodes a precursor of 204 amino acids with a putative  signal peptide of 21 amino acids. mature omp21 is a typical outer membrane protein with a high content of beta structure as determined by infrared spectroscopy. sequence comparisons show that it belongs to a new outer membrane protein family, characterized by eight amphipathic beta strands, which includes virulence proteins, such as the neisserial opacity proteins, salmonella typhimurium rck, and yersinia enterocolitica ail, as well as the major outer membrane proteins ompa from escherichia coli and oprf from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == phylogenetic relationships of salmonella based on dna sequence comparison of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase.
AB  == dna sequences covering 57% of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase were determined for 16 strains of salmonella enterica, two strains of s. bongori, and  one strain each of citrobacter freundii and yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes sequences. the phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of s. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies ii which were unsupported by a common node. the two serotypes of s. bongori were separated from s. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies ii. a tight relationship was found between s. enterica subspecies iiia consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies iiib consisting of diphasic serotypes. this is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping  genes and the 23s rrna gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.

TI  == prevalence of the "high-pathogenicity island" of yersinia species among escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans.
AB  == the fyua-irp gene cluster contributes to the virulence of highly pathogenic yersinia (yersinia pestis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica 1b). the cluster encodes an iron uptake system mediated by the siderophore yersiniabactin and reveals features of a pathogenicity island. two evolutionary lineages of this "high pathogenicity island" (hpi) can be distinguished on the basis of dna sequence comparison: a y. pestis group and a y. enterocolitica group. in this study we demonstrate that the hpi of the y. pestis  evolutionary group is disseminated among species of the family enterobacteriaceae which are pathogenic to humans. it prevails in enteroaggregative escherichia coli and in e. coli blood culture isolates (93 and 80%, respectively), but is rarely found in enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, and enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates. in contrast, the hpi was absent from enterohemorrhagic e. coli, shigella, and salmonella enterica strains investigated. polypeptides encoded by the fyua, irp1, and irp2 genes located on the hpi could be detected in e. coli strains pathogenic to humans. however, these e. coli strains showed a reduced sensitivity to the bacteriocin pesticin, whose uptake is mediated by the fyua receptor. escherichia strains do not possess the hms gene locus thought to be a part of the hpi of y. pestis. deletions of the jua-irp gene cluster affecting solely the fyua part of the hpi were identified in 3% of the e. coli strains tested. these results suggest horizontal transfer of the hpi between y. pestis and some pathogenic e. coli strains.

TI  == a novel model of bacterially-induced acute anterior uveitis in rats and the lack  of effect from hla-b27 expression.
AB  == background: humans with the major histocompatibility antigen b27 (hla-b27) are especially at risk for developing rheumatic disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and reiter's syndrome. acute anterior uveitis (aau) often occurs in association with these diseases or in hla b27 positive individuals without joint  disease. methods: we induced acute anterior uveitis in lewis rats by a standard model, the intraperitoneal injection of 200 micrograms of escherichia coli endotoxin. we also developed a novel model of uveitis secondary to gram-negative  infection. results: transgenic rats that expressed a low copy number of the b27 gene did not differ statistically from litter mate controls in the intensity of anterior uveitis as judged by histology, enumeration of cells in aqueous humor, protein in aqueous humor, or slit lamp examination. the majority of rats exposed  to live salmonella enteritidis or yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 using either an oral or intravenous route of infection developed anterior uveitis. in contrast to the disease induced by endotoxin that is most intense 24 hours after the endotoxin challenge, uveitis induced by live bacteria usually began 7 to 9 days after exposure to bacterial products, was more often unilateral, persisted for as long as 3 weeks, and was sometimes recurrent. the expression of hla-b27 did not appear to influence the incidence or severity of uveitis in b27+ low copy heterozygous animals. conclusion: this rat model of aau should facilitate evaluation of bacterial antigenic component(s) involved in the pathogenesis of live gram-negative bacteria induced aau.

TI  == enterobacteria-infected t cells as antigen-presenting cells for cytotoxic cd8 t cells: a contribution to the self-limitation of cellular immune reactions in reactive arthritis?
AB  == in enterobacteria-induced reactive arthritis (rea), different t cell subsets play a role in the induction and maintenance of the synovitic process. synovial fluid-derived alphabeta cd4, alphabeta cd8, and gammadelta t lymphocyte clones (tlc) that recognize yersinia or salmonella antigens on professional antigen-presenting cells (apc) have been characterized, and t cells themselves can function as nonprofessional apc. t cells were infected with the facultatively intracellular, arthritogenic enterobacterium yersinia enterocolitica o:3. a cd8 tlc isolated from a patient with yersinia-induced rea recognized and efficiently  lysed autologous and allogeneic yersinia-infected t cells. infected cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) had a reduced lytic capacity against syngeneic and allogeneic infected target cells, suggesting that the infection of ctl by bacteria may represent a mechanism of immune escape. in rea, antigen presentation by t cells may modify the antibacterial immune response and may also contribute to network control mechanisms of t cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

TI  == induction of alternative splicing of hla-b27 by bacterial invasion.
AB  == objective: alternative splicing of certain class i major histocompatibility complex pre-messenger rna (pre-mrna) is known to lead to generation of a cell-free soluble protein analog. this study was undertaken to examine whether this process occurs with hla-b27, whether the process is modified by arthritis-causing bacteria, and whether the assembly of the soluble molecules follows the same pathway as the integral parent molecules. methods: alternative splicing of pre-mrna was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and assembly of soluble hla-b27 by immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. results: there was alternative splicing of the pre-mrna of hla-b27. the process could be amplified by invasion with salmonella or yersinia bacteria. the soluble  hla-b27 was assembled in a pathway similar to that of the parent molecule. conclusion: the association between arthritis-causing bacteria and hla-b27 positive cells is a complex event. soluble hla-b27 is a potential key player.

TI  == genetic map of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis and nucleotide sequence of its replicons.
AB  == partial sequencing of a genomic library of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis has been used to localize in the restriction map of this plasmid the  genetic loci already described in other salmonella plasmids. the comparison of the vestigial tra region with the corresponding genes in the f plasmid allowed us to define the extent of the deletions that the s. enteritidis plasmid should have suffered. the putative replicons of the plasmid, repb and repc, were isolated and both proved to be functional in escherichia coli, but repc was segregationally unstable. the nucleotide sequence of repb showed the typical organization of repfiia replicons, although the similarity was lower than usual in this group of  replicons. the highest homology was found with the replicon of the virulence plasmid pyve439-80 from yersinia enterocolitica (72.5%). replicon repc also showed a maximum identity of 72.6% with known replicons, namely the repfib of pcolv-k30 and p307, both virulence plasmids isolated from e. coli. we conclude that the s. enteritidis plasmid could arise from the s. typhimurium plasmid through deletions, and that they are evolutionary distant from other incfi and incfii plasmids.

TI  == identification and characterization of the dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis and transfer genes of the lipopolysaccharide-related rfb locus in leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni.
AB  == immunity to leptospirosis is principally humorally mediated and involves opsonization of leptospires for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. the  only protective antigen identified to date is the leptospiral lipopolysaccharide  (lps), which biochemically resembles typical gram-negative lps but has greatly reduced endotoxic activity. little is known about the structure of leptospiral lps. a 2.1-kb ecori fragment from the chromosome of serovar copenhageni was cloned in puc18 in escherichia coli, after which flanking regions were cloned from a genomic library constructed in bacteriophage lambda gem12. sequence analysis identified four open reading frames which showed similarity to the rfbc, rfbd, rfbb, and rfba genes, transcribed in that order, which encode the four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dtdp-rhamnose for the assembly of lps in  salmonella enterica, e. coli, and shigella flexneri. an additional open reading frame downstream of the rfbcdba locus showed similarity with the rhamnosyltransferase genes of shigella and yersinia enterocolitica but not salmonella. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences showed up to 85% similarity of the leptospiral proteins with those of other gram-negative bacteria. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of recombinant clones identified the putative rfbcdba proteins, while reverse transcriptase-mediated pcr analysis indicated that the rfbcdba gene cluster was expressed in leptospira. moreover, it could restore normal lps phenotype to a defined rfbb::tn5 mutant of s. flexneri which was deficient in all four genes, thereby confirming the functional identification of a part of the leptospiral rfb locus.

TI  == critical roles of neutrophils in host defense against experimental systemic infections of mice by listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == this study shows that neutrophils are critical for combating experimental systemic infections of mice by the bacterial pathogens listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica. it shows that mice rendered  neutropenic by treatment with the granulocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody rb6-8c5 are far more susceptible than immunocompetent mice to infection with each of these three pathogens. compared to immunocompetent mice, neutropenic mice exhibit several defects in their antibacterial capabilities. firstly, the immediate inactivation of listeria, salmonella, or yersinia that initially implants in the livers and spleens that occurs in immunocompetent mice is abolished in these organs in neutropenic mice. secondly, unlike immunocompetent mice, neutropenic mice neither control the subsequent proliferation of the inoculated bacteria in the livers and spleens nor prevent dissemination of infection to other organs. thirdly, mice rendered neutropenic develop a generalized leukopenia in response to these three infections. overall, this study indicates that neutrophils perform diverse antimicrobial functions that, combined, severely restrict the rate at which listeria, salmonella, and yersinia  multiply in the tissues during the preimmune phase of infection and thereby provide the host with the opportunity to develop and express more efficient specific protective immunity.

AB  == the is200-like insertion sequence (is) is a 708-bp element recently found in yersinia pestis. its nucleotide sequence is 85% identical to that of is200 recovered in most salmonella enterica isolates. it is also present in multiple copies in y. pseudotuberculosis. in contrast, this is is found in some (biotype 1b strains) but not other y. enterocolitica strains and is absent in the nonpathogenic yersiniae: y. frederiksenii, y. kristensenii, y. intermedia, y. bercovieri, and y. mollaretii. the number and locations of the iss in the y. pseudotuberculosis genome vary among strains, resulting in a high degree of polymorphism, but is fingerprints are stable after multiple subcultures of clinical isolates. the discriminative power of is typing is better than that of ribotyping and almost as good as that of the time-consuming method of pulsotyping. overall, is200-like is a useful molecular marker in determining the  epidemiology of y. pseudotuberculosis infections.

TI  == identification of a domain in rck, a product of the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid, required for both serum resistance and cell invasion.
AB  == rck is encoded on the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid and is a member of a family of related 17- to 19-kda outer membrane proteins of enterobacteriaceae,  including ail (yersinia enterocolitica) and pagc (s. typhimurium). structural models for these proteins predict eight membrane-spanning domains alternating with hydrophilic inner and outer loops. when expressed in escherichia coli, rck and ail, but not pagc, confer high-level resistance to the bactericidal activity  of complement as well as the ability to adhere to and invade mammalian cell lines. to identify functional domains of rck, we made and screened random mutations in rck for decreased bioactivity. we found that a single amino acid substitution (glycine to aspartic acid) in the putative third outer loop greatly  reduced rck-mediated serum resistance and eukaryotic cell invasion. we then constructed two chimeric proteins between rck and pagc. substitution of the c-terminal half of rck with the corresponding pagc fragment containing both the third and the fourth outer loops abolishes the rck-mediated serum resistance and  invasion phenotypes. substitution of rck with a smaller c-terminal portion of pagc containing the fourth outer loop did not affect the invasive phenotype or serum resistance. these data reveal that the third putative outer membrane loop region is important for the virulence-associated properties of the rck protein and suggest a similarity between the mechanism of serum resistance and epithelial cell invasion involving the same domain of rck.

AB  == identification of the t-cell receptors (tcr) used by synovial cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) of patients with reactive arthritis (rea) may be crucial to better understanding the pathogenetic mechanism underlying the hla-b27 association of spondylarthropathies. the authors, therefore, sequenced 25 tcrb chains from hla-b27-restricted cd8+ ctl clones and two clonal lines specific for  self- or yersinia enterocolitica antigen isolated from synovial fluids of 3 hla-b27+ patients with rea and pbl of one healthy hla-b27+ individual. fourteen non-hla-b27-restricted ctl served as controls. both autoreactive and y. enterocolitica specific hla-b27-restricted ctl used a highly limited set of vb genes with preferential rearrangement of three closely related vb families (vb 13, 14, 17), suggesting that these families contain a preferred site for contact  with the hla-b27 molecule. in addition, the presence of limited tcrbj usage, limited heterogeneity in cdr3 sequences and dominant clones from individual donors among these ctl indicate that tcrb chain usage is further restricted by a  limited set of peptides bound to the hla-b27 molecule. limited tcr usage by sf ctl of rea patients may lay a basis for therapeutical manipulation of the t-cell  response in the spondylarthropathies.

AB  == the in vitro interactions of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium and  escherichia coli with polarized human colonic carcinoma (caco-2) cells are described. invasion of a confluent caco-2 cell monolayer by yersinia and salmonella took place within 4 h after contact, which was in marked contrast to e. coli which did not invade caco-2 cells. cytoplasmic extrusions developed on the apical membrane and indicated the site of entrance of bacteria into the caco-2 cells. intracellular yersinia and salmonella were surrounded by a vacuolar membrane. single as well as multiple bacteria were enclosed within a single vacuole. at 6 h after contact some of the intracellular yersiniae were found free in the cytoplasm. furthermore, morphological signs of degeneration of caco-2 cells such as vacuolization and autophagy were observed. caco-2 cells infected with salmonella also showed degenerative changes but the salmonellae resided within membrane-bound vacuoles in contrast to yersinia. these observations are in contrast to those described for the invasion of other cells lines (not derived from intestinal epithelium) by yersinia and may reflect more closely the interactions between yersinia and the intestinal epithelium during gastrointestinal infection.

TI  == phop/phoq transcriptional repression of salmonella typhimurium invasion genes: evidence for a role in protein secretion.
AB  == previously, the phop-repressed locus prgh was identified as important for signalling epithelial cells to endocytose salmonella typhimurium. characterization of prgh revealed that it is an operon of four genes encoding polypeptides of 392 (prgh), 80 (prgi), 101 (prgj) and 252 amino acid residues (prgk). synthesis of the 2.6 kb prghijk transcript was repressed in bacteria that activate phop/phoq, indicating that phop/phoq regulates prghijk by transcriptional repression. the prgi, prgj and prgk predicted gene products were  similar to shigella flexneri and yersinia enterocolitica proteins required for secretion of ipa and yop virulence factors. analysis of the culture supernatants  from wild-type s. typhimurium demonstrated that at least 25 polypeptides larger than 14 kda could be detected. in contrast, prgh1::tnphoa, phop-constitutive and  hil-deletion mutants had significant defects in their supernatant protein profiles. the invasion and supernatant protein profile defects of the prgh1::tnphoa mutant were both complemented by a 5.1 kb plasmid that included prghijk. these results suggest that phop/phoq regulates extracellular transport of proteins by transcriptional repression of secretion determinants and that secreted proteins may be involved in signalling epithelial cells to endocytose bacteria.

TI  == metabolic activity of pathogenic bacteria during semicontinuous anaerobic digestion.
AB  == in natural environments such as anaerobic digesters, bacteria are frequently subjected to the stress of nutrient fluxes because of the continual changes in the flow of nutrients, and to survive, they must be capable of adapting readily to nutrient changes. in this study, the metabolic activities of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, and campylobacter jejuni were studied within culture bags (versapor-200 filters, 0.22-microns pore size) in laboratory anaerobic digesters. the metabolic activity of these bacteria was indicated by their adenylate energy charge (ec) ratios and  their ability to incorporate [3h]thymidine, which was related to the respective changes in viable numbers within the culture bags during anaerobic digestion. fluctuations in the adenylate ec ratios, the uptake of [3h]thymidine, and the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes cells were probably due to constant changes in the amount of available nutrients within the anaerobic digesters. the viability of s. typhimurium increased quickly after a fresh supply of nutrients was added to the  system as indicated by the uptake of [3h]thymidine and an increase in the adenylate ec ratios. the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes organisms declined rapidly from 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/ml to 10(3) to 10(4) cfu/ml and remained at this level for an indefinite period. the decimal reduction time calculated during the period of exponential decline ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 days for these bacteria. c. jejuni had the greatest mean decimal reduction time value (3.6 days).(abstract truncated at  250 words)

AB  == survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of escherichia coli, enterococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees c; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at mcmurdo station, antarctica. plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (dvcs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. t90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica and 432 h for e. faecalis. sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. dvcs, ctc reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. forty-eight-day exposure of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees c. the detection of responsive e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica by the dvc and ctc methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. percentages of respiring e. coli and s. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. large nutrient inputs to low-temperature  marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.

TI  == salmonella typhimurium induces selective aggregation and internalization of host  cell surface proteins during invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == salmonella interact with eucaryotic membranes to trigger internalization into non-phagocytic cells. in this study we examined the distribution of host plasma membrane proteins during s. typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells. entry of s. typhimurium into hela epithelial cells produced extensive aggregation of cell surface class i mhc heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, fibronectin-receptor (alpha 5 beta 1 integrin), and hyaluronate receptor (cd-44). other cell surface proteins such as transferrin-receptor or thy-1 were aggregated by s. typhimurium  to a much lesser extent. capping of these plasma membrane proteins was observed in membrane ruffles localized to invading s. typhimurium and in the area surrounding these structures. in contrast, membrane ruffling induced by epidermal growth factor only produced minor aggregations of surface proteins, localized exclusively in the membrane ruffle. this result suggests that extensive redistribution of these proteins requires a signal related to bacterial invasion. this bacteria-induced process was associated with rearrangement of polymerized actin but not microtubules, since preincubation of epithelial cells with cytochalasin d blocked aggregation of these proteins while nocodazole treatment did not. of the host surface proteins aggregated by s. typhimurium, only class i  mhc heavy chain was predominantly present in the bacteria-containing vacuoles. no extensive aggregation of host plasma membrane proteins was detected when hela epithelial cells were infected with invasive bacteria that do not induce membrane ruffling, including yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterium that triggers internalization via binding to beta 1 integrin, and a s. typhimurium invasion mutant that utilizes the yersinia-internalization route. in contrast to the situation with s. typhimurium, class i mhc heavy chain was not selectively internalized into vacuoles containing these other bacteria. extensive aggregation of host plasma membrane proteins was also not observed when other s. typhimurium  mutants that are defective for invasion were used. the amount of internalized host plasma membrane proteins in the bacteria-containing vacuoles decreased over  time with all invasive bacteria examined, indicating that modification of the composition of these vacuoles occurs. therefore, our data show that s. typhimurium induces selective aggregation and internalization of host plasma membrane proteins, processes associated with the specific invasion strategy used  by this bacterium to enter into epithelial cells.

TI  == entrance and survival of salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica within human b- and t-cell lines.
AB  == lymphocytes, located within the peyer's patches, might be involved in the dissemination of enteropathogenic salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica bacteria. to test this hypothesis, we have investigated the susceptibility of human b- and t-cell lines to bacterial adhesion and invasion. the two s. typhimurium strains analyzed were highly invasive, while the two y. enterocolitica (o:8) strains adhered to the b- and t-cell lines but did not enter the cell lines in significant amounts. we hypothesize that the incapability of the y. enterocolitica (o:8) strains to enter the human b- and t-cell lines is most probably due to the bacterial inability to induce the internalization process upon adhesion to both cell lines. although immortalized b- and t-cell lines were used in this study, the results presented suggest the possibility that both cell types could play a role in the dissemination of intracellularly residing s. typhimurium in vivo.

TI  == salmonella stimulate macrophage macropinocytosis and persist within spacious phagosomes.
AB  == light microscopic studies of phagocytosis showed that salmonella typhimurium entered mouse macrophages enclosed in spacious phagosomes (sp). viewed by time-lapse video microscopy, bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to s. typhimurium displayed generalized plasma membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis.  phagosomes containing salmonella were morphologically indistinguishable from macropinosomes. sp formation was observed after several methods of bacterial opsonization, although bacteria opsonized with specific igg appeared initially in small phagosomes that later enlarged. in contrast to macropinosomes induced by growth factors, which shrink completely within 15 min, sp persisted in the cytoplasm, enlarging often by fusion with macropinosomes or other sp. a salmonella strain containing a constitutive mutation in the phop virulence regulatory locus (phopc) induced significantly fewer sp. similar to yersinia enterocolitica, phopc bacteria entered macrophages in close-fitting phagosomes, consistent with that expected for conventional receptor-mediated phagocytosis. these results suggest that formation of sp contributes to salmonella survival and virulence.

TI  == the novel hexapeptide motif found in the acyltransferases lpxa and lpxd of lipid  a biosynthesis is conserved in various bacteria.
AB  == two bacterial acyltransferases (lpxa of escherichia coli, lpxd of e. coli and salmonella typhimurium) have previously been shown to consist of a very unusual tandem-repeat structure with tens of repeating hexapeptides (24 hexapeptides in lpxa, 26 in lpxd). by sequencing lpxd of yersinia enterocolitica (a distant relative of e. coli and s. typhimurium within enterobacteriaceae) as well as lpxa of s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica, and by analyzing the existing data on these enzymes of ricketsia rickettsii, it was now shown that the hexapeptide repeat pattern is a very conservative property of these enzymes. even though the  overall homology (allowing equivalent amino acids) between the four proteins was  only 59% in lpxa and 58% in lpxd, the homology in the first residue of each hexapeptide was 87% in lpxa and 100% in lpxd. secondary structure prediction by predictprotein server suggested a very strong beta strand dominance in all the hexad regions. accordingly, lpxa and lpxd of various bacterial origins can now be regarded as structurally very unusual enzymes, largely consisting of hexad repeats.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the proximal half of the rfb region of shigella flexneri has been determined, and the genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dtdp-rhamnose have been identified. these genes show strong homology to the rfb genes encoding dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (strain lt2) and s. enterica serovar anatum (strain  m32) (jiang et al., 1991; wang et al., 1992). an open reading frame upstream of rfbb was also identified which encoded a protein having strong similarity with gaiu, and has been designated galf. galf has 92% amino acid sequence identity with an s. enterica lt2 gene, orf2x8, which is similarly situated upstream of rfbb (jiang et al., 1991). the t7 expression system was utilized to identify proteins corresponding to those predicted from dna sequence analysis. the similarity of the predicted proteins with proteins that are functionally identical or related, and with others of unknown function from the yersinia enterocolitica o3 rfb region, and in the escherichia coli k-12 rff region are also described. we have re-addressed the assignment of each gene of the dtdp-rhamnose pathway with the known enzymes of the pathway, in particular rfbc and rfbd. a reporter plasmid to detect genes encoding enzymes of the dtdp-rhamnose pathway is described. an analysis of the intergenic region between  galf and rfbb has been made, and comparison with the same region from s. enterica lt2 discussed.

TI  == salmonella induces the formation of filamentous structures containing lysosomal membrane glycoproteins in epithelial cells.
AB  == salmonella species invade and replicate within epithelial cells in membrane-bound vacuoles. in this report we show that upon infection of hela epithelial cells, salmonella typhimurium residues in vacuoles that contain lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lgps). four to six hours after invasion, intracellular bacteria induce the formation of stable filamentous structures containing lgps that are connected to the bacteria-containing vacuoles. formation of these lgp-rich structures requires viable intracellular bacteria and is blocked by inhibitors of vacuolar acidification. these structures are not present in uninfected cells or in cells infected with another invasive bacteria, yersinia enterocolitica. tracers added to the extracellular medium are not delivered to the salmonella-induced filaments, suggesting that these structures are different from previously described tubular lysosomes. initiation of intracellular bacterial replication correlates with formation of these lgp-containing filaments. certain  avirulent salmonella mutants that are defective for intracellular replication fail to induce formation of these structures. these observations suggest that salmonella-induced filaments containing lgps are linked to intracellular bacterial replication.

TI  == hla-b27-restricted cd8 t cells derived from synovial fluids of patients with reactive arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  == ankylosing spondylitis and seronegative spondylarthropathies such as reiter's syndrome and reactive arthritis are strongly associated with hla-b27. however, the mechanisms by which hla-b27 is involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis are unknown. if the disease association is a consequence of hla-b27's physiological function in antigen presentation, the disease should be mediated by cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) that recognise bacterial or self peptides presented by hla-b27. proof of this arthritogenic peptide model requires isolation of b27-restricted cd8 t cells from arthritic joints of patients with spondylarthropathies. an important question is whether "arthritogenic" bacteria such as yersinia or salmonella can generate hla-b27-restricted bacteria-specific  ctls. we describe such hla-b27-restricted ctls. we tested a panel of 354 alpha beta-tcr cd8 t lymphocyte clones (tlcs) that had been derived from the synovial fluid of 4 patients with reactive arthritis and 2 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. in 1 patient with yersinia-induced arthritis, 2 tlcs were identified that killed specifically yersinia-infected b27 target cells. in another patient with salmonella-induced arthritis, 1 b27-restricted cd8 tlc that recognised both  salmonella and yersinia was identified. in 5 of the 6 patients autoreactive ctls  were found, 5 of which showed b27-restricted killing of uninfected cell lines. b27-restricted ctls with specificity for arthritogenic bacteria or autoantigens provide a missing link in the pathogenesis of the hla-b27-associated spondylarthropathies.

TI  == survival of pathogenic bacteria during mesophilic anaerobic digestion of animal waste.
AB  == the survival of pathogenic bacteria was investigated during the operation of a full-scale anaerobic digester which was fed daily and operated at 28 degrees c. the digester had a mean hydraulic retention time of 24 d. the viable numbers of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni were reduced during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. escherichia coli had the smallest mean viable numbers at each stage of the digestion process. its mean t90 value was 76.9 d. yersinia enterocolitica was the least resistant to the anaerobic digester environment; its mean t90 value was 18.2 d. campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant bacterium; its mean t90 value was 438.6 d. regression analysis showed that there were no direct relationships between the slurry input and performance of the digester and the decline of pathogen numbers during the 140 d experimental period.

TI  == intracellular replication of salmonella within epithelial cells is associated with filamentous structures containing lysosomal membrane glycoproteins.
AB  == we have examined the targeting of s. typhimurium-containing vacuoles to lysosomes after invasion of cultured hela epithelial cells. our results show that intracellular bacteria colocalize with vacuoles containing lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lgps). both human lgps, hlamp-1 and hlamp-2, are present in s. typhimurium-containing vacuoles from approximately 2 h postinfection. at later times (4-6 h), long and stable filamentous structures with lysosomal markers appear connected to bacteria-containing vacuoles in infected cells. viable intracellular bacteria are required for the formation of these structures, which  are not detected in uninfected cells or in hela epithelial cells infected with another invasive bacteria, yersinia enterocolitica. kinetics analysis showed a strict correlation between the appearance of these lgp-rich filaments and the initiation of intracellular bacterial replication. moreover, these structures are absent in epithelial cells infected with certain s. typhimurium intracellular replication-defective mutants. additional data confirmed that an intact microtubule network and intravacuolar acidic ph are required to induce the formation of lgp-containing filamentous structures and that these structures are  morphologically and functionally different from previously described tubular lysosomes.

AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide o-antigen is a homopolymer of  6-deoxy-l-altrose. the cloned rfb region was sequenced, and 10 open reading frames were identified. transposon mutagenesis, deletion analysis and transcomplementation experiments showed that eight of the genes, organized into two operons, rfbabc and rfbdefgh, are essential for o-antigen synthesis. functional tandem promoters were identified upstream of both operons. of the deduced polypeptides rfba, rfbf and rfbg were similar to salmonella proteins involved in the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis. rhamnose and 6-deoxy-l-altrose are  c3-epimers suggesting that analogous pathways function in their biosynthesis. rfbd and rfbe were similar to capsular polysaccharide export proteins, e.g. kpsm  and kpst of escherichia coli. this and transposon mutagenesis showed that rfbd and rfbe function as o-antigen exporters.

AB  == the decline in viable numbers of salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica  and listeria monocytogene in beef cattle slurry is temperature-dependent; they decline more rapidly at 17 degrees c than at 4 degrees c. mesophilic anaerobic digestion caused an initial rapid decline in the viable numbers of escherichia coli, salm. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes. this was followed by a period in which the viable numbers were not reduced by 90%. the t90 values of e. coli, salm. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 d during batch digestion and 1.1 to 2.5 d during semi-continuous digestion. listeria monocytogenes had a significantly higher mean t90 value during semi-continuous digestion (35.7 d) than batch digestion (12.3 d). anaerobic digestion had little effect in reducing the viable numbers of campylobacter jejuni.

TI  == tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors block invasin-promoted bacterial uptake by epithelial cells.
AB  == the ability to enter into (invade) mammalian cells is an essential virulence determinant of many pathogenic bacteria and intracellular parasites. these organisms are internalized by host cells upon attachment to their surface. however, the mechanisms used by intracellular parasites to induce internalization into host cells have not been defined. we found that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks invasion by some pathogenic bacteria, including yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. using escherichia coli containing the cloned y. enterocolitica invasion gene inv (which codes for invasin, an integrin-binding protein), we found that staurosporine inhibits invasion by blocking bacterial internalization. two specific tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin, also block the internalization but not the  binding of bacteria, suggesting that bacterial uptake may be dependent on the activity of this enzyme class in host hela cells. in contrast to invasion promoted by invasin, the invasion of hela cells by salmonella typhimurium is not  inhibited by any of these drugs.

TI  == bacterial resistance to complement killing mediated by the ail protein of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == ail is a 17-kda outer membrane yersinia protein that mediates bacterial attachment to, and invasion of, cultured epithelial cells. we report here an alternative role for ail in the pathogenesis of yersinia infection. we found that escherichia coli hb101 harboring the 4-kilobase recombinant ail clone pvm102 were highly resistant to killing in up to 50% normal human serum. a 674-base-pair fragment of dna from pvm102, which encodes the ail gene, was inserted into puc18  and shown to promote full resistance to complement killing in e. coli hb101. cellular attachment and resistance to complement killing in a plasmid-cured inv-  strain of yersinia enterocolitica (0:8) was correlated with the thermoinduced expression of ail at 37 degrees c. insertional inactivation of ail in y. enterocolitica resulted in loss of both thermoinduced bacterial properties. cellular attachment and serum resistance were restored by complementation of the  defect by plasmid-encoded ail. complementation of cell attachment activity required bacterial growth at 37 degrees c, indicating that an additional thermoinduced factor is required for this ail function. in addition, these studies reveal that functional homology exists between ail and the structurally related protein rck, which promotes resistance to complement killing in salmonella typhimurium.

AB  == a fragment of the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid containing the rck locus, when cloned in the recombinant cosmid pade016, was shown previously to confer high-level complement resistance on both rough and smooth escherichia coli, salmonella minnesota, and s. typhimurium and was associated with the production of an outer membrane protein. we determined the nucleotide sequence of the fragment containing the rck locus. mutations in the two major open reading frames confirmed that the complement resistance mediated by pade016 was due to a  single 555-bp rck gene encoding a 17-kda outer membrane protein. analysis of the  rck gene revealed that the rck outer membrane protein consisted of 185 amino acid residues, with a calculated postcleavage molecular mass of 17.4 kda. rck is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins expressed in gram-negative bacteria, two of which have been associated with virulence-related phenotypes: pagc, required by s. typhimurium for survival in macrophages and for virulence in mice; and ail, a product of the yersinia enterocolitica chromosome capable of mediating bacterial adherence to and invasion of epithelial cell lines. rck, most closely related to pagc, represents the third outer membrane protein in this five-member family with a distinct virulence-associated phenotype.

AB  == the 23s ribosomal rna (rrna) was shown to be in two fragments in pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica. the cleavage site in the structural gene of the 23s rrna was occupied by an intervening sequence (ivs) of about 100 nucleotides, analogous to ivss found in salmonellae (burgin et al., 1990). nucleotide sequences of ivss  of several y. enterocolitica strains revealed that the ivss of the highly virulent y. enterocolitica serotypes strains, and the ivs of salmonella typhimurium were about 90% similar. on the other hand, the ivss of the highly and the poorly virulent y. enterocolitica serotypes were only about 60% similar. these results give the impression that at some point during the ivs evolution, the highly virulent y. enterocolitica and s. typhimurium both received their ivss at about the same time from the same source, and that the poorly virulent serotypes received their ivss earlier. we also found that strain lb5010, derived  by extended mutagenization of s. typhimurium lt2, had lost the ivss originally present in lt2, and that this loss had created a new 'hairpin loop' which substituted for the original 'hairpin loop'.

AB  == hep-2 cell monolayers were challenged with genetic variants of yersinia pseudotuberculosis ypiii(pib1) and yersinia enterocolitica w22708(pyl4). both strains were represented by (i) variants harboring the 70-kilobase virulence plasmid, (ii) their isogenic plasmid-cured derivatives, and (iii) two transposon  mutants constructed by insertional inactivation of the plasmid genes encoding outer membrane protein yop1 and ca2+ dependency in strains ypiii(pib1) and w22708(pyl4). when the hep-2 cells were pretreated with recombinant alpha interferon subtype a, all invasive variants of y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis, except those variants which expressed yop1, showed a significantly reduced ability to localize intracellularly. the anti-invasive effect of interferon was abolished when the gene was expressed or when a sterile  filtered sonic extract of a yop1-producing strain was added to the cell cultures. to obtain further evidence of a potential role of yop1, a dna fragment encoding yop1 cloned into the vector pbr322 was used. after introduction of the resultant  recombinant plasmid pyms2 into the plasmid-cured variant ypiii and the yop1-negative transposon mutant ypiii(pib102) of y. pseudotuberculosis, both transformants regained the ability to produce yop1 and showed complete inhibition of the interferon effect. moreover, the sterile sonic extract of an escherichia coli strain, which carried pyms2, neutralized the anti-invasive effect of interferon. the results provide direct genetic evidence that yop1 mediates inhibition of the anti-invasive effect of interferon in hep-2 cell cultures. the  results also demonstrated that yop1 itself reduces the ability of yersinia spp. to localize intracellularly in hep-2 cells.

AB  == four murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to salmonella typhi flagellin were produced. these mabs did not react with eight other enterobacterial strains tested: salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella paratyphi a, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni. all four mabs cross-reacted with salmonella muenchen flagellin indicating specificity for d antigenic flagellar epitope. one mab (c4)  was selected to develop a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) to detect s. typhi flagellin in serum samples. by use of this assay s. typhi flagellar antigen was detected in 95.5% of serum samples from patients with positive hemoculture for s. typhi, in 93.6% of samples from patients with positive serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, in 26% of samples collected from patients who were initially hemoculture-positive for s. typhi and who had undergone 7-8 d of chemotherapy, in 8.5% of samples from healthy persons from an  endemic area, and in no samples from healthy persons from a nonendemic area. the  presence of high levels of flagellin antibody titers did not interfere with the antigen detection. the detection of s. typhi flagellar antigen in patient serum may have practical value for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.

TI  == proliferative response of synovial fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to arthritogenic and non-arthritogenic microbial antigens and to the 65-kda mycobacterial heat-shock protein.
AB  == cellular immune responses to microbial antigens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some forms of arthritis including reactive arthritis, reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. we investigated the proliferative t cell responses of paired peripheral blood (pb) and synovial fluid (sf) mononuclear cells (mc) to so-called arthritogenic bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium), to control antigens, such as candida  albicans, mumps virus and purified protein derivative, to the recombinant mycobacterial 65-kda heat-shock protein (hsp 65) and the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (pha) in 16 patients with different inflammatory rheumatic diseases. the [3h]thymidine uptake of unstimulated cells (medium control) as well as the proliferative response to the different antigens tested was markedly increased in sfmc irrespective of the underlying rheumatic disease. in contrast,  mitogenic stimulation was decreased in sfmc. the proliferative response to the hsp 65 correlated significantly with the responses to yersinia, salmonella and candida. these results may reflect an enhanced function of sf antigen-presenting  cells, different functional properties and subset distributions of pb and sf t cells with a preferential accumulation of helper-inducer/memory t cells or a maintenance of an ongoing immune response by t cells cross-recognizing self epitopes such as epitopes located on the hsp 65. thus, care should be taken in the interpretation of sf t cell responses to microbial antigens as diagnostic tools in arthritis.

TI  == rapid enumeration of viable bacteria by image analysis.
AB  == a direct viable counting method for enumerating viable bacteria was modified and  made compatible with image analysis. a comparison was made between viable cell counts determined by the spread plate method and direct viable counts obtained using epifluorescence microscopy either manually or by automatic image analysis.  cultures of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated at 35 degrees c in a dilute nutrient medium containing nalidixic acid. filtered samples were stained for epifluorescence microscopy and analysed manually as well as by image analysis. cells enlarged after incubation were considered viable. the viable cell counts determined using image analysis were higher than those obtained by either  the direct manual count of viable cells or spread plate methods. the volume of sample filtered or the number of cells in the original sample did not influence the efficiency of the method. however, the optimal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5-20 micrograms ml-1) and length of incubation (4-8 h) varied with the culture tested. the results of this study showed that under optimal conditions, the modification of the direct viable count method in combination with image analysis microscopy provided an efficient and quantitative technique for counting viable bacteria in a short time.

TI  == analysis of the class-specific immune response to yersinia enterocolitica virulence-associated antigens in oro-gastrically infected rabbits.
AB  == the antibody response was analysed in rabbits oro-gastrically infected (i) with virulent-(plasmid-carrying) yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 (v-rabbits) and (ii) with the avirulent (plasmid-cured) derivative (av-rabbits). in an immunoblot assay with whole cell lysate proteins from the infecting virulent yersinia strain, a significant igg response was evident in convalescent-sera of v-rabbits and of av-rabbits, demonstrating that all rabbits seroconverted. however, v-rabbits mounted a stronger immune response to the cell lysate proteins than av-rabbits and the immune response persisted for a longer time. the post-challenge sera also reacted with whole cell lysate proteins of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, indicating cross-reactivity between the different members of enterobacteriaceae. in contrast, the antibody response against plasmid-encoded released proteins (rps) appeared specific for infection with virulent strains in  that the sera of av-rabbits failed to recognize the plasmid-encoded proteins. six days following challenge with the virulent yersinia strain all animals mounted a  serum igm and iga response to rps, followed by igg antibodies on day 9. while the igm and iga serum antibody response rapidly decreased (within five-seven and eight-ten months, respectively), igg antibodies to rps were still present one year after challenge. fourteen months after the first infection both the av-rabbits and the v-rabbits were reinfected with the virulent yersinia strain and the antibody response to rps was monitored. the v-rabbits only responded with a significant increase of igg antibodies, indicating that they were primed to the rps whereas the av-rabbits produced igm, iga and igg specific antibodies like those seen in the primary response of v-rabbits. this study indicates that the rabbit model is helpful and adequate to analyse the character and kinetics of the antibody response during yersinia infection.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == characterization of monoclonal antibodies to protein antigen of salmonella typhi.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies were produced against protein antigens of salmonella typhi. one of the antibodies (stp14) belongs to the immunoglobulin g1k subclass,  and the other (stp13) was assigned to the immunoglobulin g2a(kappa) subclass. both antibodies could recognize the 34.0-kilodalton protein antigen from s. typhi. the specificity of these antibodies was tested by immunoblotting with a panel of crude protein antigens from 12 bacteria causing enteric fever and enteric fever-like illness: s. typhi, s. paratyphi a, s. paratyphi b, s. paratyphi c, s. choleraesuis, s. enteritidis, s. krefeld, s. panama, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas pseudomallei, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a modified double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay they could detect the protein antigen at ca. 0.6 microgram/ml. these monoclonal antibodies should be of great value in the diagnostic test for detecting s. typhi antigen in samples of bodily fluids isolated from patients with typhoid fever and in studies of the chemical structure and other immunological properties of this 34.0-kilodalton protein.

AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993 [9-deoxy-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. in this study the in vitro activity of cp-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. mics were determined using an  agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. cp-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against salmonella typhi (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), s. enteritidis (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), shigella flexneri (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. dysenteriae (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. sonnei (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), vibrio cholerae (mic90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), yersinia enterocolitica (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), escherichia coli-etec (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), e. coli-eiec  (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic90 1 and 8 mg/l) and aeromonas hydrophila (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l). cp-62,993 (mic90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (mic90 1 mg/l) against isolates of c. difficile. the results suggest a potential clinical role for cp-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.

TI  == comparison of the ability of enteroinvasive escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica to enter and replicate within hep-2 cells.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium, enteroinvasive escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica possess the ability to enter intestinal epithelial cells. we used a quantitative tissue culture model employing hep-2 cells to compare the abilities of these bacteria to enter epithelial cells. s. typhimurium and yersinia species were highly infective for hep-2 cells but were unable to replicate extensively intracellularly. enteroinvasive e. coli exhibited low infectivity but replicated extensively intracellularly. the growth of enteroinvasive e. coli led to destruction of the hep-2 monolayer, whereas yersinia spp. and s. typhimurium were maintained intracellularly for prolonged periods without damage to the monolayer. the ability of enteroinvasive e. coli to enter hep-2 cells required prior growth at 37 degrees c; neither s. typhimurium nor yersinia spp. exhibited this temperature dependence for cell entry. an e. coli k-12 derivative containing a 230-kilobase plasmid from enteroinvasive e. coli was constructed. this derivative shared all the invasive characteristics of the parental enteroinvasive strain, suggesting that determinants required for cell entry and intracellular multiplication were at least partially plasmid encoded. an hb101 derivative containing a cloned invasion determinant from y. pseudotuberculosis was constructed in our laboratory. hep-2 monolayers were coinfected with these two k-12 derivatives to compare invasion determinants from enteroinvasive e. coli with those of y. pseudotuberculosis in a common genetic background. results from these experiments suggest that these organisms reside within separate intracellular compartments.

TI  == [spectrum of post-enteritic reactive arthritis in childhood].
AB  == eleven children (7 boys and 4 girls) suffered from reactive arthropathies following an enteritis. mean age at onset of disease was 9.7 years (range 3.3-14.5 years). six children had a classical reiter's syndrome and two a juvenile spondyloarthritis diagnosed earlier. in 10/11 children, onset of disease was within 5 weeks following a febrile enteritis. the enteritis was confirmed in  all 6 cases examined during the first three months after onset of disease. the arthritis was predominantly oligoarticular and affected mostly the joints of the  lower extremities and toes. recurrent enthesopathies and arthralgias occurred in  most children. hla-b27 was positive in 9 (82%). during a follow-up of 0.9 to 6.7  years, arthritis relapsed in most of the patients and 4 children had severe arthritis, and 5 sacroiliitis. urethritis and occular signs relapsed frequently,  but there were no noticeable disabilities. two other girls had self-limited arthralgia and erythema nodosum following a febrile enteritis. this disease may represent the first stage of the broad clinical spectrum of the reactive arthropathies. in our outpatient clinic of paediatric rheumatology, 9% of 127 patients had reactive arthropathies. they show close relationships to each other  and to other hla-b27-associated spondyloarthropathies. the differentiation of this group of diseases from the juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is possible and relevant.

TI  == health significance and occurrence of injured bacteria in drinking water.
AB  == enteropathogenic and indicator bacteria become injured in drinking water with exposure to sublethal levels of various biological, chemical and physical factors. one manifestation of this injury is the inability to grow and form colonies on selective media containing surfactants. the resulting underestimation of indicator bacteria can lead to a false estimation of water potability. m-t7 medium was developed specifically for the recovery of injured coliforms (both "total" and fecal) in drinking water. the m-t7 method was used to survey operating drinking water treatment and distribution systems for the presence of injured coliforms that were undetected with currently used media. the mean recovery with m-endo les medium was less than 1/100 ml while it ranged between 6  and 68/100ml with m-t7 agar. the majority of samples giving positive results with m-t7 medium yielded no detectable coliforms with m-endo les agar. over 95% of the coliform bacteria in these samples were injured. laboratory experiments were also done to ascribe the virulence of injured waterborne pathogens. enteropathogens including salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica and shigella spp. required up to 20 times the chlorine levels to produce the same injury in enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and nonpathogenic coliforms. similar results were seen with y. enterocolitica exposed to copper. the recovery of etec  was followed by delayed enterotoxin production, both in vitro and in the gut of experimental animals. this indicates that injured waterborne enteropathogenic bacteria can be virulent.

AB  == three enteric pathogens yersinia enterocolitica o:8, salmonella typhimurium, and  enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, were examined for their ability to colonize granular activated carbon (gac) in pure cultures and in the presence of autochthonous river water organisms. all three organisms readily colonized sterile gac and maintained populations of ca. 10(5) to 10(7) cfu g-1 for 14 days  when suspended in sterile river water. exposure of pathogen biofilms on gac to unsterile river water resulted in a gradual decline in pathogens on the carbon (0.08 to 0.14 log day-1). when pathogens were introduced to sterile gac in the presence of heterotrophic plate count organisms, they attached at levels similar  to those in the pure cultures and then decreased (0.10 to 0.22 log day-1). when added with heterotrophic plate count bacteria to gac supporting a mature biofilm  of native river water bacteria, they attached at a lower level (1.0 x 10(4) to 4.6 x 10(4) cfu g-1) and decreased at a more rapid rate (0.11 to 0.70 log day-1).

TI  == changes in virulence of waterborne enteropathogens with chlorine injury.
AB  == we designed experiments to assess the effect of chlorine injury on the virulence  of waterborne enteropathogens. higher chlorine doses (0.9 to 1.5 mg/liter) were necessary to produce injured yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella spp. than to produce injured enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or coliform bacteria (0.25 to 0.5 mg/liter) in the test system used; 50% lethal dose experiments in which mice were used showed that injured y. enterocolitica cells were 20 times less virulent than uninjured control cells (3,300 and 160 cfu, respectively). this decrease in virulence was not related to reduced attachment to henle 407 intestinal epithelial cells, but could be related to a loss of hela  cell invasiveness. in contrast, injured s. typhimurium and enterotoxigenic e. coli cells lost their ability to attach to henle cells. these data show that some enteropathogens and coliform bacteria differ in their sensitivities to chlorine injury and that the virulence determinants affected by chlorine may vary from one pathogen to another.

TI  == double immunofluorescence microscopic technique for accurate differentiation of extracellularly and intracellularly located bacteria in cell culture.
AB  == a double immunofluorescence staining technique is described for differentiation between cell-attached (extracellular) and ingested (intracellular) bacteria by hep-2 cells in cell culture monolayers. this method is based upon the observation that membranes of viable mammalian cells are impermeable for antibodies but are rendered permeable by treatment with fixatives. consequently, extracellular bacteria can be stained by specific rhodamine-labeled antibodies before fixation, and intracellular bacteria can be visualized by treatment with specific fluorescein-labeled antibodies after fixation. the accuracy and simplicity of this method is demonstrated with hep-2 cell culture monolayers as target cells and an isogenic pair of yersinia enterocolitica, one of which is phagocytosis resistant and the other of which is phagocytosis sensitive. furthermore, it is shown that this staining technique is also applicable for studying the interaction of bacteria with macrophages and fibroblasts.

AB  == eighty-two samples of frozen chicken from retail stores were examined for the presence of campylobacter, yersinia enterocolitica, and salmonellae. aerobic plate counts and numbers of coliform bacteria at 37 degrees c were determined. campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni was found in 22% of the samples, y. enterocolitica was found in 24.5% and salmonella typhimurium was found in one sample (1.2%). the isolated strains of y. enterocolitica belonged to serotypes 4, 5b, 6, and 8. aerobic plate counts and numbers of coliform bacteria at 37 degrees c were not found to be noticeably higher in samples containing pathogens than in  pathogen-free samples. this investigation showed that chicken does contain other  pathogenic bacteria than salmonellae. campylobacter and y. enterocolitica were isolated in much higher frequencies than salmonella.

TI  == [characteristics of microbial multiplication in parenterally infected xenopsylla  cheopis (siphonaptera) fleas].
AB  == being inoculated parenterally various microbes cause the fleas x. cheopis a stable infection which, as a rule, is preserved in experimental insects to the end of life. reproducing intensively listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium caused the death of all ectoparasites in 3 to 5 days. the increase in abundance of escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, y. enterocolitica and vaccine strains of y. pestis "ev" and francisella tularensis went on gradually and infected fleas lived up to 15--20 and more days.

TI  == differentiation of selected enterobacteriaceae by pyrolysis-gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == pyrolysis-gas-liquid chromatography was used to differentiate selected species of enterobacteriaceae. individual cultures of salmonella typhi, hafnia alvei, and proteus vulgaris, and 12 strains of yersinia enterocolitica were grown in nutrient broth. after harvest and lyophilization, the bacterial samples were pyrolyzed at 900 degrees c, and their volatile fractions were separated on a 50-m capillary column coated with carbowax 20m. the resulting pyrolysis elution patterns (pyrograms) of the four species were monitored on an integrating console, which was coupled with the chromatographic detector. the pyrograms were  divided into 312 30-s time interval areas, and each interval area was normalized  in relation to the area of the entire curve. the normalized areas were evaluated  by stepwise linear discriminant analysis, and the discriminating component coordinates were used to generate a plot of the canonical variables. distinct clustering patterns allowed discrimination among the four genera of enterobacteriaceae studied. the tight clustering of the 12 y. enterocolitica strains suggests the advantage of pyrolysis-gas-liquid chromatography over traditional approaches for species identification.

TI  == [purification and physico-chemical analysis of the fimbrial antigen in two different genera of enterobacteriacea: salmonella enteritidis and yersinia enterocolitica (author's transl)].
AB  == chemical, physical and immunological properties of the fimbrial antigen of two different genera of enterobacteriaceae, namely salmonella (s. enteritidis) and yersinia (y. enterocolitica) were analysed. only a few strains of these two bacterial genera possess a fimbrial antigen which proved to be identical in all tests. purified fimbriae are unstable in buffer solutions. they tend to form aggregates, patterns of which are between 240000 and 270000. submitted to solubility testing by various methods these aggregates easily dissociate into particles of different molecular size. treatment with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate  (sds) in 1% mercaptoaethanol at 37 degrees c for 60 minutes gave constant reproducible results. the fimbrial protein prepared by this method proved to be an antigenically active unit with a molecular weight of 23450 for s. enteritidis  and 23350 for y. enterocolitica. the electron microscope revealed that purified fimbriae of these two genera consist of extremely thin filaments (1.5 to 2.7 nm), covering the bacterial cell as an envelope. they are supposed to be composed of no more than 2 to 3 peptid chains. the presence of the amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophane may be responsible of the particular behaviour of the fimbriae which according to different external conditions react with different states of dissociation. probably the filaments are not stable in a solution as single filaments but tend to form oligomer, secondary and tertiary structures. experiments of isoelectric focusing revealed that both antigens consist of a pure protein component (composed of 17 amino acids) which appears at ph 3.9.

TI  == assessment of typhoid vaccines by using the intraperitoneal route of challenge.
AB  == present laboratory tests for human typhoid vaccines use an intraperitoneal route  of challenge given 7 days after injection of increasing doses of standard and test vaccines by the same route. in studies reported here, groups of b6d2 mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally with 2 x 10(8) acetone-killed salmonella typhi  ty2, with the vi antigen-free variant o-901, or with yersinia enterocolitica and  serratia marcescens suspensions. other groups of mice received 200 mug of purified s. typhi or s. marcescens endotoxin, or their corresponding purified lipid a components. all of the vaccinated mice (except for saline- or thioglycolate-injected controls) exhibited increased protection against the lethal intraperitoneal challenge with s. typhi ty2. serial quantitative bacterial counts carried out on peritoneal washouts and on homogenates of the draining mediastinal lymph nodes indicated the development of an antibacterial response by the vaccinated host which was not observed in the control animals. mice receiving purified endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) exhibited varying degrees of protection,  both in terms of increased host survival and the amount of inactivation of the challenge population in vivo. the response seen when the antigenically unrelated  s. marcescens lipopolysaccharide was injected was little different from that seen when the acetone-killed s. typhi ty2 whole-cell vaccine was used. this suggests that nonspecific inactivation of the intraperitoneal challenge contributes substantially to the immune response seen in mice vaccinated intraperitoneally with specific typhoid antigens.

TI  == ultrastructure of lipopolysaccharides of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli.
AB  == the fine structure of isolated lipopolysaccharides (lps) from the rough and smooth form of an yersinia enterocolitica strain (ye 75 r/ye 75 s) and from smooth forms of salmonella typhimurium (s 1010) and escherichia coli (essen) were examined electron-microscopically by negative staining. partial denaturation of lps in tris-buffer with acid and/or polymyxin b treatment revealed a common structure of strandlike lps. electron-microscopically, lps-strands were found to  consist of two identical sub-strands which form a double helix. high resolution electron microscopy permitted the identification of a total of four longitudinal  fibrils (diameter approximately 20 a); therefore, each sub-strand consists of two longitudinal fibrils. these results were correlated with those obtained with positive staining procedure and chemical fixation technique. the development of the "double-track"-profile of the outer membrane was interpreted to result from the projection of the helical longitudinal fibrils into the image plane.

TI  == enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for titration of antibodies against brucella abortus and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using phenolwater extracted lipopolysaccarides as antigen was used for detection and quantitation of antibodies against brucella and yersinia bacteria in rabbit antisera. elisa was found to be from ten to hundred-fold more sensitive than the commonly used tube agglutination assay (widal). in addition, both direct and inhibition assays using elisa revealed antigenic differences between brucella abortus and yersinia enterocolitica o-group v, previously undetected in tube agglutination and complement fixation studies. these data raise the possibility of a sensitive and  specific assay for detection of anti-brucella antibodies in human sera.
