TI  == antianaerobic antimicrobials: spectrum and susceptibility testing.
AB  == susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria recovered from selected cases can influence the choice of antimicrobial therapy. the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) has standardized many laboratory procedures, including anaerobic susceptibility testing (ast), and has published documents for ast. the  standardization of testing methods by the clsi allows comparisons of resistance trends among various laboratories. susceptibility testing should be performed on  organisms recovered from sterile body sites, those that are isolated in pure culture, or those that are clinically important and have variable or unique susceptibility patterns. organisms that should be considered for individual isolate testing include highly virulent pathogens for which susceptibility cannot be predicted, such as bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, and clostridium spp.; bilophila wadsworthia; and sutterella wadsworthensis. this review describes the current methods for ast in research and reference laboratories. these methods include the use of agar dilution, broth microdilution, etest, and the spiral gradient endpoint system. the antimicrobials potentially effective against anaerobic bacteria include beta-lactams, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. the spectrum of efficacy, antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and resistance patterns against these agents are described.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro activity of a range of anti-anaerobe antimicrobials against non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated in europe. methods: isolates from 15 laboratories in 13 countries were identified by conventional methods. the mics of 20 antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method. results: there were 488 prevotella spp., 174 fusobacteria, 69 porphyromonas spp., 33 bacteroides spp., 28 bilophila  wadsworthia and 16 campylobacter spp. isolates, one sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and four unidentified isolates. penicillin resistance (and diminished susceptibility to piperacillin) was most common in prevotella spp. and bilophila  wadsworthia but was also seen in many other species. all isolates, except three of bilophila wadsworthia, were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate. most isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin (except bilophila wadsworthia) and all were susceptible to the carbapenems. clinafloxacin was the most active quinolone, followed by trovafloxacin and then sparfloxacin. most fusobacteria were inherently resistant to the macrolides, as expected, but resistance to macrolides and a ketolide in other species was uncommon. most fusobacterium varium isolates  were resistant to clindamycin, but resistance to clindamycin in all other species was rare. tetracycline resistance was common but this did not affect the glycylcyclines. there was one isolate of bacteroides putredinis resistant to chloramphenicol, and three isolates, a bacteroides ureolyticus isolate, the sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and one of the unnamed isolates, were metronidazole resistant. rifampicin was active against most prevotella and porphyromonas spp., but not against many other genera. conclusions: penicillin resistance has increased in europe among non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, much of it due to beta-lactamase. acquired resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides and rifampicin has not significantly increased, and chloramphenicol and metronidazole are unaffected. however, resistance to tetracycline is common. the new compounds, a ketolide (hmr 3647), the glycylcyclines and clinafloxacin, are highly active.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: medical aspects.
AB  == there is still inadequate information on the role of certain newly described or reclassified anaerobes in disease processes, on their normal sites of carriage, and on their antimicrobial susceptibilities. herein, we summarize this information (most of the literature reviewed is from the past 5 years, but a few  of the articles are approximately 10 years old). porphyromonas species had seemed to be relatively nonpathogenic, but recent work indicates that this belief is incorrect. p. gingivalis, p levii-like organisms, and p. endodontalis-like organisms have been recovered from a variety of oral and extraoral infections. p. macacae has been recovered from infected cat bite wounds. sutterella wadsworthensis, recently differentiated from campylobacter gracilis, has been found in a variety of infections. bilophila wadsworthia has also been recovered from a wide variety of infections. newly described anaerobic cocci, gram-positive nonsporeforming rods, and clostridia have also been isolated from various infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of trovafloxacin against 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of trovafloxacin for 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth agar dilution technique. the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (n = 91), other members of the b. fragilis group (n = 130),  campylobacter gracilis (n = 15), other bacteroides spp. (n = 16), prevotella spp. (n = 49), porphyromonas spp. (n = 15), fusobacterium spp. (n = 62), bilophila wadsworthia (n = 24), sutterella wadsworthensis (n = 21), clostridium spp. (n = 61), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 38), and gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (n = 35). trovafloxacin inhibited all strains of b. fragilis at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, 99% of other b. fragilis group species at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, and 96% of all anaerobes tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml.
