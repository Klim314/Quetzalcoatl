TI  == oem--a new medium for rapid isolation of onion-pathogenic and onion-associated bacteria.
AB  == onions (allium cepa l.) are plagued by a number of bacterial pathogens including  pantoea ananatis, p. agglomerans, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter cloacae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. axonopodis and several pseudomonas spp. we developed a semi-selective medium, termed onion extract medium (oem), to selectively and rapidly isolate bacteria pathogenic to and associated with onions and onion-related samples including bulbs, seeds, sets, transplant seedlings, soil and water. most strains of interest grow sufficiently on oem in 24h at 28 degrees c for tentative identification based on colony morphology, facilitating further characterization  by microbiological and/or molecular means.
