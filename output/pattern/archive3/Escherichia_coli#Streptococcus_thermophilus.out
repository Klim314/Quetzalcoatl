construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.
the influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3) cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.
antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated polysaccharides from pleurotus eryngii and streptococcus thermophilus ascc 1275.
polysaccharides from pleurotus eryngii (peps) and exopolysaccharides from streptococcus thermophilus ascc 1275 (st1275 eps) were sulphated, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated and crude polysaccharides were determined. degree of sulphonation of peps and st1275 eps was 0.69 and 0.31, respectively. characteristic bands in ft-ir spectra indicated that the sulphate group was at the c6 position of the galactose skeleton. antioxidant activities of peps and st1275 eps were significantly (p<0.05) improved after sulphonation. for tested crude and sulphated polysaccharides, sulphated peps had the largest inhibition zone against escherichia coli atcc 25922 and staphylococcus aureus cmcc 26003 while sulphated st1275 eps had the largest inhibition zone against listeria monocytogenes cmcc 54001. furthermore, sulphated peps had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for e. coli atcc 25922, and both sulphated peps and sulphated st1275 eps had the lowest mics on s. aureus cmcc 26003 and l. monocytogenes cmcc 54001.
enzymatic synthesis of bioinformatically predicted microcin c-like compounds encoded by diverse bacteria.
abstract the trojan horse escherichia coli antibiotic microcin c (mcc) consists of a heptapeptide attached to adenosine through a phosphoramidate linkage. mcc is synthesized by the mccb enzyme, which terminally adenylates the ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide precursor mcca. the peptide part is responsible for mcc uptake; it is degraded inside the cell to release a toxic nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate. bionformatic analysis reveals that diverse bacterial genomes encoding mccb homologues also contain adjacent short open reading frames that may encode mcca-like adenylation substrates. using chemically synthesized predicted peptide substrates and recombinant cognate mccb protein homologs, adenylated products were obtained in vitro for predicted mcca peptide-mccb enzyme pairs from helicobacter pylori, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus johnsonii, bartonella washoensis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and synechococcus sp. some adenylated products were shown to inhibit the growth of e. coli by targeting aspartyl-trna synthetase, the target of mcc. importance our results prove that mcc-like adenylated peptides are widespread and are encoded by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and by cyanobacteria, opening ways for analyses of physiological functions of these compounds and for creation of microcin c-like antibiotics targeting various bacteria.

probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
aim: to investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. methods: the septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. the animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. the mixture of probiotics included bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. we observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. we also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. the severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. results: probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. the survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. however, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, p < 0.05). the total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, p < 0.05). the total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, p < 0.05). the population of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, p < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, p < 0.05). with probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). conclusion: escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.
proteolytic activation of proteose peptone component 3 by release of a c-terminal peptide with antibacterial properties.
the milk protein proteose peptone component 3 (pp3, also known as lactophorin) is a small phosphoglycoprotein, which is exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland. a 23-residue synthetic peptide (lactophoricin, lpcin s), corresponding to the c-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix of pp3, has previously been shown to permeabilize membranes and display antibacterial activity. lactophorin readily undergoes proteolytic cleavage in milk and during dairy processing, and it has been suggested that pp3-derived peptides are part of milk's endogenous defense system against bacteria. here, we report that a 26-residue c-terminal peptide (lpcin p) can be generated by trypsin proteolysis of pp3 and that structural and functional studies of lpcin p indicate that the peptide has antibacterial properties. the lpcin p showed alpha-helical structure in both anionic and organic solvents, and the amount of alpha-helical structure was increased in the presence of lipid vesicles. oriented circular dichroism showed that lpcin p oriented parallel to the membrane surface. however, the peptide permeabilized calcein-containing vesicles efficiently. lpcin p displayed antibacterial activity against streptococcus thermophilus, but not against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the pp3 full-length protein did not display the same properties, which could indicate that pp3 functions as a precursor protein that upon proteolysis, releases a bioactive antibacterial peptide.
the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
production of glutathione using a bifunctional enzyme encoded by gshf from streptococcus thermophilus expressed in escherichia coli.
glutathione (gsh) is one of the most ubiquitous non-protein thiols that is involved in numerous cellular activities. the gene coding for a novel bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the reaction for glutathione synthesis, gshf, was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus siim b218 and expressed in escherichia coli jm109. in the presence of the precursor amino acids and atp, the induced cells of e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) could accumulate 10.3 mm gsh in 5 h. the s. thermophilus gshf was insensitive to feedback inhibition caused by gsh even at 20 mm. at elevated concentrations of the precursor amino acids and atp, e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 36 mm gsh with a molar yield of 0.9 mol/mol based on added cysteine and of 0.45 mol/mol based on added atp. when atp was replaced with glucose, e. coli jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 7 mm in 3h. saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to generate atp for gsh production. in the presence of glucose and the pmr1 mutant of s. cerevisiae by4742, jm109 (ptrc99a-gshf) produced 33.9 mm gsh in 12h with a yield of 0.85 mol/mol based on added l-cysteine. it is shown that the s. thermophilus gshf can be successfully used for gsh production.
antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.
the inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of blpg(st), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
the blp(st) cluster of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other s. thermophilus strains. in this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of s. thermophilus lmd-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). we showed that lmd-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes. using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons blpd(st)-orf2, blpu(st)-orf3, and blpe(st)-blpf(st) (bac(st) operons) and of the blpg(st) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain lmd-9. our results present evidence that the blp(st) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. among the four class ii bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(st) operons, blpd(st) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. the blpd(st) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to lactococcus lactis. the remaining three bac(st) peptides, blpu(st), blpe(st), and blpf(st), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. the blpg(st) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most listeria species. by complementation of the motility deficiency of escherichia coli dsba, we showed that blpg(st) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.
biopreservation by lactobacillus paracasei in coculture with streptococcus thermophilus in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cream cheeses.
the viability of lactobacillus paracasei and its effect on growth of the microbiota in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cheeses during storage at 4 +/- 1 degree c was investigated. three cheese-making trials (t1, t2, and t3) were prepared in quadruplicate, all supplemented with a streptococcus thermophilus culture. l. paracasei subsp. paracasei was added to cheeses in t1 and t2, and inulin was added to cheeses in t2. counts of l. paracasei, s. thermophilus, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., dnase-positive staphylococcus, and yeasts and molds were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. viable counts of l. paracasei in probiotic (t1) and synbiotic (t2) cheeses remained above 7 log cfu/g during the entire storage period, whereas counts of s. thermophilus remained above 9.5 log cfu/g for cheeses from ti, t2, and t3. populations of coliforms, staphylococcus spp., and dnase-positive staphylococcus were higher in t3 cheese and differed significantly from those in cheeses from t1 and t2 (p < 0.05). inhibition of contaminants prevailed when both l. paracasei and s. thermophilus were present in fresh cream cheese and probably was due to acid production by both strains; bacteriocin production was not found. addition of inulin in t2 did not impact microbial viability (p > 0.05). l. paracasei subsp. paracasei in coculture with s. thermophilus was inhibitory against microbial contaminants in fresh cream cheese with or without the addition of inulin, indicating the potential use of this combination in a probiotic and synbiotic product.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
assessment of enzymatic cleaning agents and disinfectants against bacterial biofilms.
purpose: microbial biofilm has become difficult to control by antibiotic and biocide regimes that are effective against suspended bacteria. their colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally controlled through cleaning and disinfection. this study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of the disinfectants including bio-ow, econase ce, gamanase gc 140, indiage 44l, mannanase amb, multifect p-3000, neutrase, pandion, paradigm, pectinex ultra sp-l, promozyme, resinase a2x, spezyme aa300, spezyme ga300 and vinozym ec, and the proteinase against bacterial biofilms. methods: the effectiveness of 20 commercial disinfectants against pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) biofilms using a fluorometric technique was examined. additionally the disinfectants were also tested against lactobacillus bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), lactobacillus lactis (l. lactis) and streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) isolates using microtitration tray based turbidimetric techniques. escherichia coli (e. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. results: among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (pandion, resinase a2x, spezyme ga300 and paradigm) were the most potent against bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10(3) cfu (colony forming units)/ml). however, only resinase a2x and paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against p. aeruginosa biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. the performance of the disinfectants was reduced in the presence of milk. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. the mic was tested on lactobacillus bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus), lactobacillus lactis (l. lactis) and streptococcus thermophilus (s. thermophilus) isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for paradigm against s. thermophilus and l. lactis were lower than l. bulgaricus. whereas, the mic of pandion against l. bulgaricus was lower than mic against l. lactis. resinase a2x had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was less than or equal to 2.4 mg/ml and spezyme ga 300 concentration less than or equal to 7.3 mg/ml. minimum inhibitory concentration of pandion against l. bulgaricus was 2.7 microg/ml and against l. lactis 5.3 microg/ml. growth of s. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of pandion tested. conclusions: the choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time of action is very important when destroying microbes. it is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning process
evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/- 0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in dairy fermentation systems.
we examined (i) the persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of e. coli o157:h7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, rpos, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of e. coli o157:h7 in the yogurt production process. in commercial products inoculated with 10(3) cfu/ml, e. coli o157:h7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (ph 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (ph 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) cfu/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (ph 4.1). for the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus r110 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis d280 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris d62 alone, and streptococcus thermophilus c90 alone showing the least inhibition. recovery of the rpos mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. no e. coli o157:h7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) cfu/ml. our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of e. coli o157:h7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce e. coli o157:h7 cfu numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the rpos protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in yoghurt during preparation and storage at 4 degrees c.
cow's milk was inoculated with ca 10(3) and 10(7) cfu ml-1 escherichia coli o157:h7. after fermentation at 42 degrees c for 0-5 h, the yoghurt was stored at 4 degrees c. two kinds of yoghurt were used: traditional yoghurt (ty), made with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus starter cultures, and 'bifido' yoghurt (by), made with the two starter cultures plus bifidobacterium bifidum. after 7 d e. coli o157:h7 decreased from 3.52 to 2.72 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.08 to 5.32 log10 cfu ml-1 in ty, and from 3.49 to 2.73 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.38 to 5.41 log10 cfu ml-1 in by. the ph values of yoghurt dropped from 6.6 to 4.5 and 4.4 in ty (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively), and from 6.6 to 4.6 and 4.5 in by (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively).
role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
[antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
