TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - Interactions between salivary Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  - Coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. Bifidobacterium adolescentis OLB6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii JCM8350, Streptococcus mitis OLS3293, Streptococcus sanguinis JCM5708, Veillonella parvula ATCC17745 or Porphyromonas gingivalis OB7124, but it did coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using FISH revealed that B. adolescentis OLB6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. It did, however, adhere to biofilms of A. naeslundii, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with A. naeslundii nor with V. parvula. These results suggest that the adhesion of B. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. Heat- or proteinase K-treated F. nucleatum could not coaggregate with B. adolescentis. Similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase K-treated B. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. It is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of B. adolescentis and F. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. The data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with suspected anaerobic infections].
AB  - The study involved 394 clinical samples sent to the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of Hacettepe University Adult Hospital between January 1997 and May 2004 for anaerobic cultivation. Since multiple cultures from the same clinical samples of the same patient were excluded, the study was carried on 367 samples. The anaerobic cultures were performed in anaerobic jar using AnaeroGen kits (Oxoid, Basingstoke, U.K.) or GENbox (bioMerieux, Lyon, France). The isolates were identified by both classical methods and "BBL Crystal System" (Becton Dickinson, U.S.A.). While no growth was detected in 120 (32.7%) of the clinical samples studied, in 144 samples (39.2%) only aerobes, in 28 (7.6%) only anaerobes and in 75 (20.5%) of the samples both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated. The number of the anaerobic isolates was 217 from 103 samples with anaerobic growth. Of these 103 samples 15 showed single bacterial growth whereas in 88 samples multiple bacterial isolates were detected. Anaerobic isolates consisted of 92 Gram negative bacilli (Bacteroides spp. 50, Prevotella spp. 14, Porphyromonas spp. 10, Fusobacterium spp. 7, Tisierella spp. 2, unidentified 9), 57 Gram positive bacilli (Clostridium spp.17, Propionibacterium spp. 16, Lactobacillus spp. 8, Actinomyces spp. 5, Eubacterium spp. 2, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 1, Mobiluncus mulieris 1, unidentified nonspore forming rods 7), 61 Gram positive cocci (anaerobic cocci 44, microaerophilic cocci 17), and 7 Gram negative cocci (Veillonella spp.). In conclusion, in the samples studied with prediagnosis of anaerobic infection, Bacteroides spp. (23%) were the most common bacteria followed by anaerobic Gram positive cocci (20.3%) and Clostridium spp (7.8%).
TI  - [Actinomycosis infection of the cerebellum].
AB  - The case is presented of a 37-year-old male with a cerebellar abscess due to Actinomyces israelii. The patient was admitted after dental surgery because of fever and symptoms indicative of raised, intracranial pressure. No abnormalities were detected in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. CT scan revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with perifocal oedema and occlusive hydrocephalus. After emergency external ventriculostomy complete removal of the mass was achieved in a two-stage surgical procedure. Culture of the pus under anaerobic conditions resulted in a growth of Actinomyces israelii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. A 20-day regimen of antibiotics including penicillin G 10 million U x 3/d and clindamycin 900 mg x 3/d was administered. The patient made a full recovery. Pathogenesis and therapeutic principles of CNS infections due to Actinomyces israellii are discussed.
TI  - Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in obligate anaerobes.
AB  - The distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in clinically important  bacteria was studied to determine why obligate anaerobes were susceptible to metronidazole and facultative ones were not. With obligate and facultative anaerobes, nitroreductase activity, metronidazole uptake, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity and drug susceptibility were estimated. Nitroreductase activity was distributed in the obligate anaerobes and some facultative ones such as Streptococcus faecalis. Propionibacterium acnes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomyces israelii and most of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Bacteria with nitroreductase activity were able to absorb the drug. Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was distributed in all of the obligate anaerobes, whereas Prop. acnes, Bif. adolescentis, A. israelii and all of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility was the same as that of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Therefore metronidazole may selectively inhibit obligate anaerobes with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Nitroreductase activity may be necessary for drug uptake as well.

TI  - Antibacterial sensitivity of Bifidobacterium (Lactobacillus bifidus).
AB  - The antibacterial sensitivity patterns of gram-positive, nonsporeforming, anaerobic bacilli variously classed as Lactobacillus bifidus, Actinomyces bifidus, or Bifidobacterium were studied by the plate dilution method. A total of 34 strains, mostly from human feces, was studied. Three species, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum, were represented with 11, 11, and 6 strains, respectively. The other six strains fell into four other species. Most strains of all types resisted 100 mug/ml or more of neomycin, polymyxin B, and nalidixic acid. They were somewhat less resistant to kanamycin and still less so to streptomycin. All strains were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml of penicillin G and erythromycin, by 3.1 units or less per ml of bacitracin, by 3.1 mug/ml or less of chloramphenicol, and by 6.2 mug/ml or less of tetracycline and lincomycin. Most strains were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml of vancomycin. Results were very variable with cephalothin and nitrofurantoin, with some strains quite resistant. With half of the drugs tested, there were moderate differences in sensitivity between different species. These data are discussed in relation to the effect of antimicrobial agents on bifid bacilli in the normal human fecal flora, in relation to the implications thereof, and in relation to the usefulness of several agents (particularly neomycin, nalidixic acid, and polymyxin B) in selective media for Bifidobacterium.
