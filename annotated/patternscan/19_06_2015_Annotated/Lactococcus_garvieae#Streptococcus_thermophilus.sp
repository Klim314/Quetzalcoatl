TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  == biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. in this study, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for  a large collection of lab of different origins. the tested isolates belong to 11  species of the lactobacillus genus and to streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus salivarius and lactococcus garvieae. the results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (bc), triclosan (tr), chlorhexidine (ch), and sodium hypochlorite (sh) are not frequent among lab. moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high mic values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher mic values for the other biocides.

TI  == diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of casin, a traditional spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  == classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional spanish casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. as with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of casin was shown to be high by both culturing and dgge analyses. the culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (lab) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. of the 14 bacterial species identified, lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. as expected, the dgge profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. among these, a band corresponding to streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. this species had never been identified from traditional spanish cheeses  previously. culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of  casin manufacture. random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) profiling suggested that the l. garvieae and l. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. in addition, only a single l. lactis rapd pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. after a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for casin. additional species (such as lactobacillus plantarum and corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.

TI  == bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk using pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). most of the identified bacterial species in zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (lab), e.g., streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus johnsonii. using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. the main dominant species was st. thermophilus followed by lc. garvieae. other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific pcr assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the ttge and dgge results. lc. garvieae, lc. raffinolactis, ln. citreum,  and lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of egyptian fermented milk.
