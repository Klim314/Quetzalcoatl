TI  == cell wall-anchored nuclease of streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. during  disease progression, s. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. in the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed swan (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). recombinant swan protein (rswan) digested multiple forms of dna including net dna and human rna, which required both mg(2+) and ca(2+) for optimum activity. furthermore, dnase activity of s. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing dna. in-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. these findings indicated that swan is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of swan in the cell wall fraction. the sensitivity of s. sanguinis to net killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to net killing. our results suggest that the swan nuclease on the  bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of s. sanguinis encountering nets during the course of disease progression.

TI  == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

TI  == molecular characterization of promoters of the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris temperate bacteriophage bk5-t and identification of a phage gene implicated in the regulation of promoter activity.
AB  == dna fragments from the temperate lactococcal bacteriophage bk5-t were cloned into the promoter-detecting plasmid pmu1328. five dna fragments conferring promoter activity were selected by transformation of streptococcus sanguis and were functional in escherichia coli, s. sanguis, and lactococcus lactis subspp. lactis and cremoris. the nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of transcription from each promoter in both e. coli and s. sanguis. transcription was initiated from the same nucleotide in these two organisms, and the promoters  contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequence for e. coli promoters. the activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to threefold when a compatible plasmid containing a 3.8-kilobase-pair ecori fragment (ecori-f) of bk5-t was coresident with the promoter-containing plasmid in either  l. lactis subsp. cremoris or e. coli. data from tn5 mutagenesis, subcloning experiments, and dna sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of ecori-f that contains a 621-base-pair open reading  frame. this region has been designated bpi (for bk5-t promoter inhibitor).

TI  == role of the arginine deiminase system in protecting oral bacteria and an enzymatic basis for acid tolerance.
AB  == the arginine deiminase system was found to function in protecting bacterial cells against the damaging effects of acid environments. for example, as little as 2.9  mm arginine added to acidified suspensions of streptococcus sanguis at a ph of 4.0 resulted in ammonia production and protection against killing. the arginine deiminase system was found to have unusual acid tolerance in a variety of lactic  acid bacteria. for example, for streptococcus rattus fa-1, the ph at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full ph unit below the minimum for glycolysis (ph 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (ph 4.7). the acid tolerance of the arginine deiminase system appeared to be primarily molecular and to depend on the tolerance of individual enzymes rather than on the membrane physiology of  the bacteria; ph profiles for the activities of arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase in permeabilized cells showed that the enzymes were active at phs of 3.1 or somewhat lower. overall, it appeared that ammonia could be produced from arginine at low ph values, even by cells with damaged membranes, and that the ammonia could then protect the cells against acid damage until the environmental ph value rose sufficiently to allow for the reestablishment of a difference in ph (delta ph) across the cell membrane.

TI  == intergeneric and intrageneric conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance determinants in leuconostoc spp.
AB  == transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmids pip501 and pam beta 1 from streptococcus faecalis to leuconostoc dextranicum and leuconostoc cremoris occurred between cells that were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of dnase. transfer of pip501 to leuconostoc spp. also occurred when streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus lactis were used as donors. in addition,  transfer of pip501 and pam beta 1 was observed from l. cremoris and l. dextranicum transconjugants to s. sanguis and s. faecalis. expression of the pam  beta 1 erythromycin and pip501 erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was essentially equivalent in donors and transconjugants. frequencies of transfer generally ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. intrageneric transfer of pip501 and pam beta 1 occurred between l. cremoris and l. dextranicum strains in the same approximate range. these data further extend the host range of pip501 and pam beta 1 and demonstrate another example of gene transfer in the genus leuconostoc.

TI  == biological and biochemical characterization of novel lipid-like antibacterial substances (mutalipocins) produced by streptoccus mutans strain 32k.
AB  == two novel antibacterial substances (designated mutalipocins) have been isolated from the culture supernatant of streptoccus mutans strain 32k (serotype c). the mutalipocins were purified by extraction of the culture supernatant with light petroleum (b.p. range 30-60 degrees c), followed by lobar column chromatography on lichroprep rp-8. hplc indicated that both mutalipocin preparations (ml-i and ml-ii) were homogeneous. the mr values of ml-i and ml-ii were less than 1000. both mutalipocins were unaffected by treatment over the ph range 3.0-10.0, or with phospholipase a or proteolytic enzymes, but were partially inactivated by treatment with lipase or phospholipase c. ml-ii was resistant to heat treatment.  tlc indicated that ml-i and ml-ii contained unsaturated, aldehyde and/or ketone,  and ester groups. the inhibition of s. mutans by ml-i and ml-ii was due to bactericidal, rather than bacteriostatic, activities. the antibacterial spectra of ml-i and ml-ii were narrower and more species-specific than those of bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == regulation of arginine-ornithine exchange and the arginine deiminase pathway in streptococcus lactis.
AB  == streptococcus lactis metabolizes arginine by the arginine deiminase (adi) pathway. resting cells of s. lactis grown in the presence of galactose and arginine maintain a high intracellular ornithine pool in the absence of arginine  and other exogenous energy sources. addition of arginine results in a rapid release of ornithine concomitant with the uptake of arginine. subsequent arginine metabolism results intracellularly in high citrulline and low ornithine pools. arginine-ornithine exchange was shown to occur in a 1-to-1 ratio and to be independent of a proton motive force. the driving force for arginine uptake in intact cells is supplied by the ornithine and arginine concentration gradients formed during arginine metabolism. these results confirm studies of arginine and  ornithine transport in membrane vesicles of s. lactis (a. j. m. driessen, b. poolman, r. kiewiet, and w. n. konings, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 84:6093-6097). the activity of the adi pathway appears to be affected by the internal concentration of (adenine) nucleotides. conditions which lower atp consumption (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, high ph) decrease the adi pathway activity, whereas uncouplers and ionophores which stimulate atp consumption increase the activity. the arginine-ornithine exchange activity matches the adi pathway most probably by adjusting the intracellular levels of ornithine and arginine. regulation of the adi pathway and the arginine-ornithine exchanger at the level of enzyme synthesis is exerted by glucose (repressor, antagonized by cyclic amp) and arginine (inducer). an arginine/ornithine antiport was also found in streptococcus faecalis ds5, streptococcus sanguis 12, and streptococcus milleri rh1 type 2.

TI  == reconstitution of atp-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  == membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus lactis, and streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-d-glucoside in the presence of escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. for reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated e. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-d-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. atp-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was  comparable to that found in parent vesicles. recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. the properties of atp-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. in proteoliposomes, atp-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and  nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an  inhibitor of the f0f1-atpase. on the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microm vanadate, for s. faecalis, s. lactis, and s. sanguis, respectively. this marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an e1e2-type ion-motive pump. these data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an atp-dependent proton  circulation via the f0f1-atpase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating  atpase. thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an atp-linked process analogous to the ion-motive atpases of eukaryotic membranes.

TI  == the phylogenetic position of streptococcus and enterococcus.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, s. equinus, s. bovis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. cricetus, s. lactis, s. raffinolactis and enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16s ribosomal rna. all the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the brochothrix and listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'clostridium' branch of gram-positive eubacteria. within the steptococcus-enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.

TI  == identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  == a total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with api-20 strep kits and also by established methods. the api method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.

TI  == transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis with streptococcus lactis plasmid dna.
AB  == streptococcus lactis plasmid dna, which is required for the fermentation of lactose (plasmid plm2001), and a potential streptococcal cloning vector plasmid (pdb101) which confers resistance to erythromycin were evaluated by transformation into streptococcus sanguis challis. plasmid plm2001 transformed lactose-negative (lac-) mutants of s. sanguis with high efficiency and was capable of conferring lactose-metabolizing ability to a mutant deficient in enzyme iilac, factor iiilac, and phospho-beta-galactosidase of the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system. plasmid pdb101 was capable of high-efficiency transformation of s. sanguis to antibiotic resistance, and the plasmid could be readily isolated from transformed strains. however, when 20 plm2001 lac+ transformants were analyzed by a variety of techniques for the presence of plasmids, none could be detected. in addition, attempts to cure the lac+ transformants by treatment with acriflavin were unsuccessful. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate that the transformants had acquired a phospho-beta-galactosidase characteristic of that normally produced by s. lactis  and not s. sanguis. it is proposed that the genes required for lactose fermentation may have become stabilized in the transformants due to their integration into the host chromosome. the efficient transformation into and expression of plm2001 and pdb101 genes in s. sanguis provides a model system which could allow the development of a system for cloning genes from dairy starter cultures into s. sanguis to examine factors affecting their expression and regulation.

TI  == molecular cloning of the lactose-metabolizing genes from streptococcus lactis.
AB  == restriction endonucleases and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to analyze plasmid plm2001, which is required for lactose metabolism by streptococcus lactis lm0232. the enzymes xhoi, ssti, bamhi, and kpni each cleaved the plasmid into two fragments, whereas ecori and bglii cleaved the plasmid into seven and five fragments, respectively. sizing of fragments and multiple digestions allowed construction of a composite restriction map. the kpni fragments of plm2001 were cloned into the kpni cleavage site of the vector plasmid pdb101. a recombinant plasmid (psh3) obtained from a lactose-fermenting, erythromycin-resistant (lac+ eryr) transformant of streptococcus sanguis challis was analyzed by enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. plasmid psh3 contained 7 of the 11 kpni-hindiii fragments from plm2001 and 5 of the 7 fragments from pdb101. it was  determined that a 23-kilobase (kb) kpni-generated fragment from plm2001 had been  cloned into pdb101 with deletion of part of the vector plasmid. the recombinant plasmid could be transformed with high frequency into several lac- strains of s.  sanguis, conferring the ability to ferment lactose and erythromycin resistance. the presence of psh3 allowed a strain deficient in enzyme iilac, factor iiilac, and phospho-beta-galactosidase of the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system to efficiently ferment lactose. under conditions designed to maximize curing of plasmid dna with acriflavin, no lac- derivatives could be isolated from cells transformed with psh3. seven of the 40 lac+ colonies isolated after 10 transfers in acriflavin were shown to be sensitive to erythromycin and did not appear to harbor plasmid dna.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == plasmid transformation of streptococcus lactis protoplasts: optimization and use  in molecular cloning.
AB  == the parameters affecting polyethylene glycol-induced plasmid transformation of streptococcus lactis lm0230 protoplasts were examined to increase the transformation frequency. in contrast to spreading protoplasts over the surface of an agar medium, their incorporation into soft agar overlays enhanced regeneration of protoplasts and eliminated variability in transformation frequencies. polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 3,350 at a final concentration of 22.5% yielded optimal transformation. a 20-min polyethylene glycol treatment of protoplasts in the presence of dna was necessary for maximal  transformation. the number of transformants recovered increased as the protoplast and dna concentration increased over a range of 3.0 x 10(6) to 3.0 x 10(8) protoplasts and 0.25 to 4.0 micrograms of dna per assay, respectively. with these parameters, transformation was increased to 5 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(4) transformants  per microgram of dna. linear and recombinant plasmid dna transformed, but at frequencies 10- to 100-fold lower than that of covalently closed circular dna. transformation of recombinant dna molecules enabled the cloning of restriction endonuclease fragments coding for lactose metabolism into s. lactis lm0230 with the streptococcus sanguis cloning vector, pgb301. these results demonstrated that the transformation frequency is sufficient to clone plasmid-coded genes which should prove useful for strain improvement of dairy starter cultures.

TI  == [conjugational plasmid transfer from a, b and h streptococci to n streptococci].
AB  == plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol was successfully  transferred from group a, b and h streptococci to group n streptococci by a process akin to conjugation. the results showed that plasmids from streptococcal  groups other than n were able to replicate in lactic streptococci as well. the transfer experiments were carried out by using a membrane filter mating technique. four of the five plasmids used (psm15346, psm10419, pip501, and pel1)  were transferred at frequencies ranging from 10(-1) to 10(-8) transconjugants per donor colony-forming unit. the highest transfer frequencies were obtained when s. pyogenes strain 15346 (psm15346) served as the donor strain. the identy of transconjugants was verified by testing for the presence of unselected markers of the recipient strains, and both transduction and transformation were ruled out as the mechanisms of transfer.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
