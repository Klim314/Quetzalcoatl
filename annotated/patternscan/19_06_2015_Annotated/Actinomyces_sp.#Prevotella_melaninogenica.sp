TI  == comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. study design: an in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials,  using a disc-diffusion method. results: a total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited  resistance; on the other hand, ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.

TI  == black stain - a review.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to summarise the fundamentals about black stain, its diagnosis and possible differential diagnoses as well as its microbiology and therapy. in addition, various studies investigating the relationship between black stain and dental caries are examined. many studies report lower caries prevalence in children with black stain, but this finding could not be confirmed  by all authors. also, a negative relation between degree of staining and caries severity has been described. reasons for these results are not yet clear but it was speculated that they are related to the specific oral microflora described in black stain-affected individuals.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == the microbiological origin of fluorescence observed in plaque on dentures during  qlf analysis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbiological origin of plaque fluorescence observed during quantitative light-induced fluorescence (qlf) analysis. plaque was sampled from dentures, because of easy accessibility and the homogeneous background provided by the denture tooth during imaging, and the acknowledged comparability to occlusal plaque. forty removable poly(methyl methacrylate) dentures were screened for the presence of fluorescent plaque deposits during qlf analysis. dentures were photographed, qlf images were recorded and samples of fluorescent plaque were taken. plaque samples were cultured on fastidious anaerobe agar, wilkins chalgren agar and sabourauds dextrose agar. plates were screened under qlf and fluorescent colonies were subcultured and identified. areas of red, orange and green fluorescence were detected on the fitting and non-fitting surfaces of dentures. the red and orange  fluorescing species were prevotella melaninogenica, actinomyces israelii and candida albicans, which are generally acknowledged to be secondary colonisers, present in more mature plaque. green fluorescence was observed in streptococcal species (early colonisers) and fusobacterium nucleatum (important organism in plaque development). non-fluorescent colonies were also cultured. plaque which accumulates on susceptible surfaces tends to be associated with caries, but it may be its maturity, rather than the presence of cariogenic streptococci, that is more likely to provide a microbiological link between red fluorescence and caries.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  == background: most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. method: subjects with chronic periodontitis (n, sweden=101; usa=115; brazil=58; chile=26) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) at six sites per  tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples=6036). % dna probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites  in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota  in subjects from brazil, chile, sweden and usa (p<0.001), while mean proportions  of treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). in contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. besides these species, prominent species in brazil were actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in  chile, prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in sweden a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in usa a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), p. intermedia (6.8%) and c. gingivalis (6.1%). conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. these differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == faropenem, a new oral penem: antibacterial activity against selected anaerobic and fastidious periodontal isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole  against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. the  organisms tested comprised porphyromonas gingivalis (29), prevotella spp. (eight), prevotella melaninogenica (seven), prevotella intermedia (five), actinomyces spp. (25), fusobacterium nucleatum (14), peptostreptococcus spp. (11), bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and bacteroides forsythus (two). the antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying mics, mbcs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (pae). faropenem was highly active  against all the anaerobes tested (mic(90) < or = 0.5 mg/l) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x mic at between 12 and 24 h. in addition, faropenem had an in vitro pae on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.

(11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for a. odontolyticus (11) and for  a. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for a. viscosus (7). macrolide activity  was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in prevotella sp. (20%) and in f. nucleatum (7%). isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among peptostreptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp. a post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on p. gingivalis and e. corrodens. the good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  == [antilysozyme activity of anaerobic bacteria from fecal microflora in man].
AB  == for the first time anaerobic bacteria of the fecal microflora in man have been found be capable of inactivating lysozyme. the presence of this antilysozyme sign has been noted in both gram-positive anaerobes (bifidobacterium, propionibacterium, eubacterium, actinomyces israelii) and in gram-negative anaerobes (bacteroids, prevotella melaninogenica). the expression of antilysozyme activity in the anaerobes under study has been determined. the possible biological role of this sign of the indigenous intestinal microflora has been discussed.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == establishment of oral anaerobes during the first year of life.
AB  == anaerobic species constitute a significant part of the bacterial community of the mouth. although the time and species involved in the primary colonization of infants are of great importance by forming the basis for further colonization, the development of the oral anaerobic microflora with age is still inadequately understood. in the present study, time and succession of colonization of oral anaerobes were longitudinally examined in 44 healthy caucasian infants at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. unstimulated saliva samples were quantitatively cultured on non-selective brucella blood agar and several selective media for the isolation of anaerobic micro-organisms. the most frequent anaerobic finding in two-month-old infants was veillonella spp. the prevotella melaninogenica group also represented early colonizing species, and the frequency increased remarkably during the first year of life, whereas the prevotella intermedia group organisms  seemed to be late colonizers. fusobacterium nucleatum, non-pigmented prevotella spp., and porphyromonas catoniae were occasional findings in subjects at 2 months but frequent findings in those at one year of age. f. nucleatum was the most frequent strictly anaerobic species in one-year-old infants; other fusobacteria were also occasionally found. the frequency of facultative/micro-aerophilic corroding rods and capnocytophaga spp. started to increase toward the end of the  first year. except for the common presence of facultative/micro-aerophilic actinomyces spp., other anaerobic gram-positive species were only occasionally present in these infants. once established, early-colonizing species tended to persist in the mouth. our longitudinal study demonstrated the establishment of several anaerobic species with steadily increasing frequencies during the first year of life.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == isolation of periodontal species after guided tissue regeneration.
AB  == one advanced localized periodontal lesion in each of 10 patients was treated using the guided tissue regeneration procedure. six weeks after placement of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe) membranes, microbial samples were taken  from each treated site and the membranes were removed. six weeks later the cases  were re-evaluated. they had all healed successfully with varying amounts of gain  of clinical attachment. gram-negative, anaerobic rods were found in all samples and made up 31% of all organisms cultivated. in 1 patient, porphyromonas gingivalis was found in a proportion of 17.5%. six of the other 9 patients harbored prevotella intermedia (mean proportion 21.3%) and 6 prevotella melaninogenica (6.8%). fusobacterium and capnocytophaga were also frequently found. the results demonstrate that eptfe membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal microorganisms. the importance of bacterial colonization on clinical  success is presently not known. further studies are needed to determine the effect of the presence or absence of putative pathogens during guided tissue regeneration.

TI  == non-human primates used in studies of periodontal disease pathogenesis: a review  of the literature.
AB  == the inability to examine initiation and progression of periodontal disease and to assess certain therapies in humans has led to a great interest in the use of animal models in periodontal research. some of the most prominent animals used are non-human primates. this article reviews the characteristics of non-human primate models in periodontal health, in the transition from health to gingivitis to periodontitis, and in experimental gingivitis and periodontitis. where possible, the results of these studies are compared with results from human studies. only a few studies have compared in detail the anatomy, physiology, immunology, and tissue interactions in monkeys with those of humans. with the exceptions of differences and variations in size of the dentition, the number of  each tooth type as well as larger canines, presence of diastemata between anterior teeth, and an edge-to-edge relationship of the incisors, the dental and  periodontal anatomy of non-human primates seem quite similar to that of humans. clinically healthy gingiva can be established and maintained in non-human primates, and gingivitis as well as periodontitis occur in these animals. it is possible to induce experimental periodontitis by placement of peri-dental silk ligatures or orthodontic elastics as well as by surgical removal of alveolar bone. although the most appropriate model for studies of periodontal disease pathogenesis in non-human primates appears to involve the application of silk ligatures, some difficulties may occur in establishing periodontal break-down by  using this model. many clinical, histological, microbiological, and immunological characteristics of spontaneous and experimental marginal inflammation in most non-human primates are similar to those in humans. the most significant differences between small non-human primates and humans are the very limited number of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the inflammatory infiltrate of squirrel monkeys (saimiri sciureus) and marmosets. therefore, the use of squirrel monkeys  and marmosets may not be appropriate in many studies of periodontal disease pathogenesis. the most significant microbial differences between macaque species  and humans are a lower proportion of actinomyces species, the presence of a catalase-producing prevotella melaninogenica strain, and the high carrier rate for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque of macaque species. the significance of these differences is presently unknown. it is concluded that the use of many non-human primate species due to the apparent close anatomic and biologic similarities to humans is appropriate in experimental studies of periodontal disease, provided the use of laboratory animals is requisite and lower species are not applicable.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. one microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and  two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic gram-negative organisms. fusobacterium spp., prevotella melaninogenica, and p. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. while rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were  a common feature of nonrecall patients. the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. the differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. the cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. samples from clefts were never wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less capnocytophaga and actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.

AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

TI  == comparative bacteriological studies on summer mastitis in grazing cattle and pyogenes mastitis in stabled cattle in denmark.
AB  == a total of 143 secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis (sm) in grazing  cattle and from 89 cases of pyogenes mastitis (pm) in stabled cattle were examined bacteriologically. the typical bacteriological finding was a mixed flora in which the predominant organisms were actinomyces pyogenes (sm-70%, pm-85%), peptostreptococcus indolicus (54%, 54%), a microaerophilic coccus (stuart-schwan  coccus) (26%, 25%), fusobacterium necrophorum biovar b (22%, 12%), bacteroides melaninogenicus (20%, 9%) and streptococcus dysgalactiae (21%, 5%). all except six cases occurred in non-lactating animals or within three weeks after parturition. the majority of animals (about 90%) had only one quarter affected and no differences in quarter distribution were observed between the two groups.

TI  == summer mastitis in heifers: studies on the seasonal occurrence of actinomyces pyogenes, peptostreptococcus indolicus and bacteroidaceae in clinically healthy cattle in denmark.
AB  == with the aim of investigating the seasonal occurrence of actinomyces pyogenes, peptostreptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii and fusobacterium necrophorum, and thus the potential for development of summer mastitis, clinically healthy danish holstein-friesian heifers due to calve in the autumn were sampled from the teat tip, the conjunctiva and the oral cavity at 2-6 week intervals from 1979 to 1981. the overall isolation rates of f. necrophorum,  p. indolicus and b. melaninogenicus ss. levii, in order of significance, were significantly higher during the pasture period whereas no differences in isolation rates of a. pyogenes between housed and pastured animals were detected. f. necrophorum was recovered almost exclusively from the oral cavity, p. indolicus and a. pyogenes occurred most frequently in samples from the teat skin, whereas isolates of b. melaninogenicus ss. levii were evenly distributed between  conjunctiva and teat tip samples. a distinct seasonal pattern of the isolation rates of summer mastitis pathogens was recorded, which corresponded closely to the seasonal activity of symbovine insects, in particular the headfly hydrotaea irritans (fallen). however, the high proportion of clinically healthy bacterial carriers as compared with the incidence of clinical disease strongly suggests that as yet unknown contributing or triggering factors, apart from the mere presence of the relevant bacterial species, are required for the establishment and development of clinical summer mastitis.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == [bacteriological study on juvenile periodontitis].
AB  == the predominant cultivable microflora of 23 pockets in 15 juvenile periodontitis  (jp) patients was studied for the first time in china using the current anaerobic methodology. samples were taken with sterile paper points and dispersed on a vortex mixer. then the diluted samples were plated on the non-selective blood agar plates and selective mgb medium which favors the growth of actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans (aa) and incubated in anaerobic chamber for 5 days. from each sample 15 or more isolated colonies were picked in sequence without selection and subcultured. the isolates were identified mainly by schrechenberger's 4 hour rapid methods for biochemical and fermentative tests and the chromatographic analysis of acid end products using ion-chromatography. the results were as follows: 1. the microflora of healthy sulci of 7 healthy young subjects was significantly different from that in the pocket of jp patients. the predominant species in healthy sulci were streptococcus spp and capnocytophaga gingivalis. 2. the species increased significantly in jp patients in prevalence and proportions  was eubacterium. other species in high proportions were bacteroides oris, b. melaninogenicus, b. gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, and actinomyces meyeri, etc. 3. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the samples.

TI  == a note on ultra-violet red fluorescence of anaerobic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == anaerobes other than the bacteroides melaninogenicus group isolated from clinical material produce an ultra-violet red fluorescence when grown under certain conditions in vitro. these organisms include other members of the genus bacteroides as well as strains of some species of clostridium, bifidobacterium and actinomyces. the major fluorescent pigment was identified as protoporphyrin ix. factors necessary for the production of fluorescence are the presence of blood or haem and a fermentable carbohydrate during growth on a solid medium. fluorescence intensity was related to the concentration of blood and fermentable  carbohydrate present but was independent of inoculum size. certain commercially available blood agar bases designed specifically for the isolation of fastidious  anaerobes from clinical material which contain added carbohydrate were shown to induce fluorescence in certain organisms. this may lead to the misidentification  of some anaerobes as b. melaninogenicus.

TI  == bacterial igg and igm antibody titers in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == igg and igm antibody titers to eight bacterial isolates were measured by indirect immunofluorescence and elisa in sera from acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug) patients during the acute phase, from anug patients during the convalescent phase, from patients with gingivitis and from subjects with normal gingiva. subjects were matched with respect to age and sex. compared to the gingivitis and healthy groups, the anug groups exhibited significantly higher igg and igm titers to intermediate-sized spirochetes and higher igg titers to bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp intermedius. the findings support recent studies showing that these organisms are major bacterial components in anug lesions. they also suggest that these bacteria proliferate above-normal levels several weeks or months prior to the clinical onset of anug.

TI  == effects of endogenous and exogenous inhibitors on the incorporation of labeled precursors into dna by human mononuclear cells.
AB  == the degree of responsiveness of lymphoid cells to activation by mitogens and antigens is commonly assessed in vitro by measuring radioactive dna precursor incorporation. several lines of evidence indicate that artifacts affect the results and that these measurements may not be an accurate reflection of cell activation. cultures of blastogenically activated lymphocytes contain soluble, noncytotoxic factors that inhibit the incorporation of radioactive nucleosides into dna by dividing cells without affecting their rate of dna synthesis. inhibitors were found in the serum component of the medium and in the bacterial homogenates used to activate the cells, and they were produced by the activated cells. inhibitor activity in serum has properties expected of a nucleoside such as thymidine, including a molecular weight of less than 10(3). the inhibitor activity present in some bacterial homogenates and that produced by activated cells enzymically degrade labeled dna precursors, thereby preventing their availability for incorporation. other bacterial preparations contain dna precursors, which compete with labeled nucleosides for incorporation, and additional low-molecular-weight inhibitor is produced when the preparations are incubated. preparations of various bacteria differ greatly with regard to the potency of their inhibitor activity. in some cases incorporation of label in activated cultures is reduced to background levels. inhibition by these substances leads to erroneous conclusions regarding the proliferative activity of cultured lymphocytes, since the amount of label incorporated does not accurately  indicate the true rate of dna synthesis of the cells.

TI  == humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  == serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. with the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin g (igg), iga, and igm antibody titers to isolates of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides  melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleation were determined. antibody titers of the igg and iga classes to b. melaninogenicus, b. ochraceus, f. nucleatum, and s. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. no correlations were found with serum igm titers. these findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the igg and iga  classes.

AB  == the changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. two rhesus monkeys were scaled  and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic  tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. over the 40 day experimental period and  74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. the plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. the total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from  initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. the flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. during treatment b. melaninogenicus and fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. after cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but b. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  == the role of bacteroides melaninogenicus and other anaerobes in periodontal infections.
AB  == recent taxonomic and anatomical studies of dental plaque associated with periodontal health and disease have demonstrated that differences in the microbial populations in plaque may be responsible for the initiation and progression of disease. the consistent isolation of large numbers of anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria from the depths of periodontal lesions has suggested an  important role for these organisms. bacteria that have been isolated include capnocytophaga (bacteroides ochraceus), other species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, selenomonas, spirochetes, campylobacter, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium, peptococcus, and other genera. the periodontopathic potential  of oral strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus has been explored in a number of investigations because these organisms are consistently isolated from periodontal lesions. studies of b. melaninogenicus have included purification of a capsular substance, characterization of the lipopolysaccharide and a variety of toxic substances and lytic enzymes, and ecologic aspects of its colonization. understanding of the nature and pathogenic mechanisms of the oral microbiota may  lead to control of this pandemic infection.

TI  == attachment of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.
