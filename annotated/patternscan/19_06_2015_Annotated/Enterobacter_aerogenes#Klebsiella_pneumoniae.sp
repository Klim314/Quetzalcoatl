TI  == enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes and e. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. these gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in europe and  particularly in france. the dissemination of enterobacter sp. is associated with  the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. in addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently  adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. the balance of the prevalence, e.  aerogenes versus e. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last  period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes klebsiella pneumoniae to enterobacter sp. it is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this e. aerogenes/e. cloacae evolution.

TI  == molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  == objective: to investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (esc)-resistant enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. methods: esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. esbl/ampc/carbapenemase genes were analysed using pcr and sequencing. for e. coli, phylogenetic groups and mlst were determined. plasmids were characterized by transformation and pcr-based replicon typing. subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. results: 175 esc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. the isolates were escherichia coli(n=65), citrobacter freundii (n=52), enterobacter cloacae (n=38), morganella morganii (n=5), enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), hafnia alvei (n=2), shigella spp. (n=2), citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), escherichia hermannii (n=1), kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and pantoea agglomerans (n=1). the following esbl genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blactx-m-1 (n=17), blactx-m-15 (n=16), blactx-m-14 (n=9), blactx-m-2 (n=3), blactx-m-3 (n=2), blactx-m-24 (n=2), blactx-m-27 (n=1), blactx-m-32 (n=1), blashv-12 (n=2), blashv-65 (n=1) and blatem-52 (n=1). plasmidic ampc (pampc) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. one person carried two different e. coli isolates, one with blactx-m-1 and the other with blacmy-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying enterobacteriaceae harboring esbl and/or pampc genes was 5.2 %. in eight e. coli isolates the ampc phenotype was caused by mutations in the ampc promoter  region. no carbapenemase genes were identified. a large variety of e. coli genotypes was found, st131 and st10 being most common. conclusions: esbl/pampc genes resembled those from patients in dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. the role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.

TI  == clonal dissemination of oxa-370- producing klebsiella pneumoniae in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == enzymes of the oxa-48-family have become one of the most important beta-lactamases in the world. a new oxa-48 variant (oxa-370) was first described  in an enterobacter hormaechei isolated in rio grande do sul (south region of brazil) in 2013. here we report the detection of the blaoxa-370 gene in 24 isolates belonging to three enterobacteriaceae species (22 in klebsiella pneumoniae, 01 in enterobacter cloacae and 01 in enterobacter aerogenes) from five hospitals in rio de janeiro in 2013 and 2014. the isolates showed a multidrug resistance profile and 12.5% were resistant to polymyxin b. besides blaoxa-370, no other carbapenemase genes were observed, by pcr, whereas blaoxa-1  was found in all isolates and 22 (91.6%) possessed blactx-m-15. molecular typing  by pfge in the k. pneumoniae isolates, showed the presence of two clonal groups (kpa - 21 isolates and kpb - 1 isolate). kpa was characterized as st16 and kpb as st1041 by mlst. st16 has been observed in kpc-producing k. pneumoniae in rio de janeiro. plasmid analysis performed in six oxa-370-representative isolates showed plasmids harboring the blaoxa-370 gene in all strains, ranging from 25 kb to 150  kb. thus, this study suggests that there is an urgent need to investigate the presence of oxa-370 and the dissemination of the clone k. pneumoniae st16 carrying this gene in brazil.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of kpc-2-producing enterobacteriaceae (non-klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from brazil.
AB  == in brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blakpc-2 gene, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae. this study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in enterobacteriaceae  (non-k. pneumoniae) species from 9 brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. three  hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. by disk diffusion  and e-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin b (16.5%), the most resistant species being enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. we found great clonal diversity and a variety of blakpc-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial tn4401 structure. therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of kpc-2 in 9 enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described  such as pantoea agglomerans and providencia stuartii.

TI  == further modification of the modified hodge test for detecting metallo-beta-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the modified hodge test (mht) was designed to detect carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe). this study evaluated variables  to improve the performance of mht. methods: carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolated from november 2010 to march 2013 at the asan medical  center, were evaluated, including 33 metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producers and 103 non-cpes. mht was performed by using two carbapenem disks (ertapenem and meropenem; becton dickinson, usa), three media (mueller-hinton agar (mha), macconkey agar (mac), and zinc-enriched mha), and two inoculums (0.5-mcfarland [mcf] suspension and a 10-fold dilution of it.) pcr was performed to detect beta-lactamase genes of the mbl, ampc, and ctx-m types. results: the sensitivity  of mht for detecting new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm) producers was highest using ertapenem and 0.5-mcf, 52.0% on mha and 68.0% on mac, respectively. ndm-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (ndmkp) were detected with higher sensitivity on mac (78.6%) vs. mha (28.6%) (p=0.016), but vim-producing enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia were detected with higher sensitivity on mha (78.5%) vs. mac (14.3%) (p=0.004). mbl producers were consistently identified with lower  sensitivity using meropenem vs. ertapenem, 39.4% vs. 60.6% (p=0.0156), respectively. the effects of zinc and inoculum size were insignificant. enterobacter aerogenes producing unspecified ampc frequently demonstrated false positives, 66.7% with ertapenem and 22.2% with meropenem. conclusions: the mht should be adjusted for the local distribution of species and the carbapenemase type of mbl producers. mac and ertapenem are preferable for assessing ndmkp, but  mha is better for vim. laboratory physicians should be aware of the limited sensitivity of mht and its relatively high false-positive rate.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == separation and confirmation of nine enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the gene.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla ndm-1 gene in clinics in hainan province, china. collected clinical bacterial isolates that were enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (ip/ipi) e-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and agarose gel electrophoresis (age) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. the species of the strains carrying the bla ndm-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. through the ip/ipi e-test, 21 of the 30 collected enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. following bla ndm-1 gene pcr amplification, age and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla ndm-1 drug resistance gene. the biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, two were escherichia coli, two were enterobacter cloacae and one was enterobacter aerogenes. drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. however, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin b and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. the sensitivity rate  to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. this clinical study of enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla ndm-1 gene in hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables imported from the dominican republic, india, thailand, and vietnam.
AB  == to examine to what extent fresh vegetables imported into switzerland represent carriers of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, 169 samples of different types of fresh vegetables imported into switzerland from the dominican republic, india, thailand, and vietnam were analyzed. overall, 25.4% of the vegetable samples yielded one or more esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, 78.3% of which were multidrug resistant. sixty isolates were  obtained: escherichia coli, 26; klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; enterobacter cloacae,  6; enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and cronobacter sakazakii, 1. we found 29 isolates  producing ctx-m-15, 8 producing ctx-m-14, 7 producing ctx-m-55, 3 producing ctx-m-65, 1 each producing ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-27, and ctx-m-63, 5 producing  shv-2, 3 producing shv-12, and 1 producing shv-2a. four of the e. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: ctx-m-15-producing b2:st131 (1 isolate), d:st405 (1 isolate), and d:st38 (2 isolates). one of the d:st38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec) d:st38  lineage. two of the k. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (st15) and st147. the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of esbl genes and a concern for food safety.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == first report of a clinical, multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolate coharboring fosfomycin resistance gene fosa3 and carbapenemase gene blakpc-2 on the same transposon, tn1721.
AB  == in order to understand the genetic background and dissemination mechanism of carbapenem resistance and fosfomycin resistance in enterobacteriaceae isolates, we studied a clinical escherichia coli strain hs102707 isolate and an enterobacter aerogenes strain hs112625 isolate, both of which were resistant to carbapenem and fosfomycin and positive for the bla(kpc-2) and fosa3 genes. in addition, a clinical klebsiella pneumoniae strain hs092839 isolate which was resistant to carbapenem was also studied. a 70-kb plasmid was successfully transferred to recipient e. coli j53 by a conjugation test. pcr and southern blot analysis showed that bla(kpc-2) was located on this plasmid. the complete sequence of phs102707 showed that this plasmid belongs to the p11 subfamily (incp1) and has a replication gene, several plasmid-stable genes, an intact type  iv secretion system gene cluster, and a composite transposon tn1721-tn3 that harbored bla(kpc-2). interestingly, a composite is26 transposon carrying fosa3 was inserted in the tn1721-tnpa gene in phs102707 and phs112625, leading to the disruption of tn1721-tnpa and the deletion of tn1721-tnpr. however, only is26 with a truncated tn21-tnpr was inserted in phs092839 at the same position. to our knowledge, this is the first report of fosa3 and bla(kpc-2) colocated in the same tn1721-tn3-like composite transposon on a novel incp group plasmid.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular characteristics of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in a health care system in los angeles, california, from 2011  to 2013.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are a concern for health care in the united states but remain relatively uncommon in california. we describe the phenotype, clonality, and carbapenemase-encoding genes present in cre isolated from patients at a californian tertiary health care system. cre for this study were identified by evaluating the antibiograms of enterobacteriaceae isolated in  the ucla health system from 2011 to 2013 for isolates that were not susceptible to meropenem and/or imipenem. the identification of these isolates was subsequently confirmed by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of flight, and broth microdilution tests were repeated to confirm the cre phenotype. real-time pcr for bla(kpc), bla(sme), bla(imp), bla(ndm-1), bla(vim), and bla(oxa-48) was performed. clonality was assessed by repetitive sequence-based pcr (reppcr) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). of 15,839 nonduplicate clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates, 115 (0.73%) met the study definition for cre. this number increased from 0.5% (44/8165) in the first half of the study to  0.9% (71/7674) in the second (p = 0.004). the most common cre species were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli. a carbapenemase-encoding gene was found in 81.7% (94/115) of cre and included bla(kpc) (78.3%), bla(ndm-1) (0.9%), and bla(sme) (2.6%). the majority of bla(kpc) genes were in k. pneumoniae isolates, which fell into 14 clonal groups on typing. bla(kpc) was identified in more than one species of cre cultured from  the same patient in four cases. three bla(sme)-carrying serratia marcescens isolates and one bla(ndm-1) carrying providencia rettgeri isolate were detected.  cre are increasing in california, and carbapenemases, particularly kpc, are a common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in this region.

TI  == microbiological features of kpc-producing enterobacter isolates identified in a u.s. hospital system.
AB  == microbiological data regarding klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacter spp. are scarce. in this study, 11 unique kpc-producing enterobacter isolates were identified among 44 ertapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter isolates collected between 2009 and 2013 at a hospital system in western pennsylvania. all cases were healthcare-associated and occurred in medically complex patients. while pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed diverse restriction patterns overall, multilocus sequence  typing identified enterobacter cloacae isolates with sequence types 93 and 171 from 2 hospitals each. the levels of carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations were highly variable. all isolates remained susceptible to colistin and tigecycline, and the majority, to amikacin and doxycycline. a blakpc-carrying incn plasmid conferring trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was identified in 3 of the isolates. spread of blakpc in enterobacter spp. appears to be due to  a combination of plasmid-mediated and clonal processes.

TI  == blood stream infections due to oxa-48-like carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae: treatment and survival.
AB  == background: blood stream infections (bsis) due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are associated with high hospital mortality rates and present a tremendous challenge to clinicians. the optimal treatment remains undefined. we aimed to investigate the risk factors for mortality and the correlation between different treatment modalities and outcomes. methods: the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of a cohort of 36 patients with bsis due to cre were investigated and a retrospective nested case-control study of surviving and non-surviving patients was conducted. results: fifty percent of  the cases were male and the mean patient age was 54.9 +/- 15.8 years. klebsiella  pneumoniae was the etiological agent in 26 cases (72.2%), escherichia coli in eight (22.2%), and enterobacter aerogenes in two (5.5%). all strains were phenotypically positive for carbapenemase activity and all except two (one e. coli and one k. pneumoniae) yielded both blaoxa-48 carbapenemases and blactx-m-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in pcr products. the 14-day, 28-day, and all-cause in-hospital mortality rates were 41.6%, 50%, and 58.3%, respectively. the median time to death was 8 days (range 2-52 days). no significant differences were observed between survivors and non-survivors in terms of baseline characteristics, comorbid conditions, etiologies, or sources of bacteremia, however hematological malignancies (p=0.015) and prolonged neutropenia (p=0.044) were more common in non-survivors. microbiological eradication and clinical response within 7 days were two major determinants of 28-day attributable mortality (p=0.001 and p=0.001, adjusted r(2)=0.845). colistin-based dual combinations, and preferably triple combinations, were associated with significantly better outcomes when compared to non-colistin-based regimens (p<0.001). time to active treatment had a significant effect on the course of infection (p=0.014). conclusion: earlier active treatment with colistin based regimens and microbiological and clinical response within 7 days are major  predictors of survival in cases of bsis due to cre. rectal screening offers the advantage of earlier recognition and prompt empirical treatment.

TI  == incidence rates of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in france: a prospective nationwide study in 2011-12.
AB  == objectives: to determine proportions and incidence rates of enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemase among those non-susceptible (ns) to carbapenems in france. methods: from november 2011 to april 2012, 71 laboratories recorded non-duplicate enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates ns to at least one carbapenem  and the total number of isolates of the different species. carbapenem mics were determined by broth microdilution and the beta-lactamase content by dna microarray. results: during the study period, the 71 laboratories identified 133  244 enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 846 (0.63%) were ns to at least one carbapenem. carbapenem-ns isolates accounted for 0.07% (61/90 148) among escherichia coli isolates, 1.1% (111/10 436) among klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.2% (492/5971) among enterobacter cloacae and 4.0% (84/2104) among enterobacter aerogenes. among the 541 available carbapenem-ns isolates, 222 (including 63 randomly selected e. cloacae) were further analysed after confirmation of carbapenem non-susceptibility. none of the enterobacter spp. isolates produced carbapenemase. among the other species, 28 isolates produced carbapenemases (22 oxa-48, 4 kpc and 2 ndm), accounting for an estimated proportion of carbapenemase-producing isolates of 0.08% for all species, 0.01% for e. coli and  0.27% for k. pneumoniae. the incidence-density rate in the participating hospitals was 0.0041 per 1000 hospital-days and the incidence rate was 0.0027 per 100 admissions. conclusions: the incidence-density rate of carbapenemase-producing isolates per 1000 hospital-days was low and 30-fold lower than that of carbapenem-ns isolates (0.125) and almost 300-fold lower than that of esbl-producing isolates (1.104) in these french hospitals.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 biocidal fabrics based on silver under conditions of high relative humidity.
AB  == background: the survival of pathogenic microorganism on fabrics in the health care environment has a important role in nosocomial infections. the use of biocidal fabrics and surfaces could reduce the prevalence of the microorganisms in the hospital environment. methods: in this study, the persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 fabrics containing biocidal fibers (bf) in the long term following desiccation and subsequent storage was examined at 40% and 90% relative humidity (rh). results: very few strains survived more than 7 days at 40% rh on fabrics containing 67% bf, and only strains of acinetobacter baumanii and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived on fabric containing 100% bf. none of the strains tested survived 14 days on the 2 fabrics, 67% or 100% bf, under these environmental conditions. in contrast, at higher rh ( approximately 90%), most of the strains tested showed prolonged survival on both fabrics, and all strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and a baumannii survived for more  than 14 days; however, in a petri dish, most of the microorganisms tested showed  a higher survival even at 28 days. the gram-positive cocci and a baumannii were the most persistent bacteria on the petri dish. conclusions: this study emphasizes the effect of rh on the survival of nosocomial bacteria on 2 commercially available fabrics containing biocide. evidence of the clinical efficacy of these bf-containing fabrics is lacking.

TI  == resistance determinants and mobile genetic elements of an ndm-1-encoding klebsiella pneumoniae strain.
AB  == multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae are emerging as a serious infectious disease challenge. these strains can accumulate many antibiotic resistance genes  though horizontal transfer of genetic elements, those for beta-lactamases being of particular concern. some beta-lactamases are active on a broad spectrum of beta-lactams including the last-resort carbapenems. the gene for the broad-spectrum and carbapenem-active metallo-beta-lactamase ndm-1 is rapidly spreading. we present the complete genome of klebsiella pneumoniae atcc baa-2146, the first u.s. isolate found to encode ndm-1, and describe its repertoire of antibiotic-resistance genes and mutations, including genes for eight beta-lactamases and 15 additional antibiotic-resistance enzymes. to elucidate the evolution of this rich repertoire, the mobile elements of the genome were characterized, including four plasmids with varying degrees of conservation and mosaicism and eleven chromosomal genomic islands. one island was identified by a  novel phylogenomic approach, that further indicated the cps-lps polysaccharide synthesis locus, where operon translocation and fusion was noted. unique plasmid  segments and mosaic junctions were identified. plasmid-borne blactx-m-15 was transposed recently to the chromosome by isecp1. none of the eleven full copies of is26, the most frequent is element in the genome, had the expected 8-bp direct repeat of the integration target sequence, suggesting that each copy underwent homologous recombination subsequent to its last transposition event. comparative  analysis likewise indicates is26 as a frequent recombinational junction between plasmid ancestors, and also indicates a resolvase site. in one novel use of high-throughput sequencing, homologously recombinant subpopulations of the bacterial culture were detected. in a second novel use, circular transposition intermediates were detected for the novel insertion sequence iskpn21 of the isncy family, suggesting that it uses the two-step transposition mechanism of is3. robust genome-based phylogeny showed that a unified klebsiella cluster contains enterobacter aerogenes and raoultella, suggesting the latter genus should be abandoned.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in north america 2010-2011.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. this report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in north america in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) identified in esbl-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of enterobacteriaceae. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. the incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), bla(ampc), and bla(kpc) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of kpc-encoding pkpqil-like plasmids and their distribution in new jersey and new york hospitals.
AB  == the global spread of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) is predominately associated with k. pneumoniae strains genotyped as sequence type 258 (st258). the first st258-associated plasmid, pkpqil, was described in israel in 2006, but its  history in the northeastern united states remains unknown. six pkpqil-like plasmids from four k. pneumoniae isolates (three st258 and one st234), one escherichia coli isolate, and one enterobacter aerogenes isolate, collected from  2003 to 2010 in new york (ny) and new jersey (nj) hospitals, were completely sequenced. the sequences and overall sizes of the six plasmids are highly similar to those of pkpqil; the major difference is that five of six nj/ny strains harbor blakpc-2, while pkpqil contains blakpc-3. moreover, a 26.7-kb fragment was inverted in pkpqil-234 (from st234 k. pneumoniae), while a 14.5-kb region was deleted in pkpqil-ec (from st131 e. coli). pcr screening of 284 other clinical k. pneumoniae isolates identified 101 (35.6%) harboring pkpqil-like plasmids from 9  of 10 surveyed hospitals, demonstrating the wide dissemination of pkpqil in this  region of endemicity. among the positive isolates, 87.1% were typed as st258 and  88.1% carried blakpc-2. the finding of pkpqil-like plasmid in this study from strains that predate the initial report of kpc in israel provides evidence that pkpqil may have originated in the united states. our findings demonstrate that pkpqil plasmids are both spreading clonally in st258 strains and spreading horizontally to different sequence types and species, further highlighting the clinical and public health concerns associated with carbapenem resistance.

TI  == hospital clonal dissemination of enterobacter aerogenes producing carbapenemase kpc-2 in a chinese teaching hospital.
AB  == carbapenems are first-line agents for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae. however, resistance  to carbapenems has increased dramatically among enterobacteriaceae in our hospital. in this study, we report clonal dissemination caused by carbapenem-resistant enterobacter aerogenes (crea). in 2011, crea was identified  from 12 patients admitted to the neurosurgical ward. all 12 clinical isolates were non-susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, ertapenem, imipenem or meropenem. all isolates carried the gene encoding klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (kpc-2), except for the isolate e4. however, a remarkably lower expression level of the porin ompf was detected in the non-kpc-2-producing isolate e4 on sds-page compared with the carbapenem-susceptible isolate. epidemiological and molecular investigations showed that a single e. aerogenes strain (pfge type a), including seven kpc-2-producing clinical isolates, was primarily responsible for the first isolation and subsequent dissemination. in a  case-control study, we identified risk factors for infection/colonization with crea. mechanical ventilation, the changing of sickbeds and previous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were identified as potential risk factors. our findings suggest that further studies should focus on judicious use of available  antibiotics, implementation of active antibiotic resistance surveillance and strict implementation of infection-control measures to avoid the rapid spread or  clonal dissemination caused by carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in healthcare facilities.

AB  == glycerol, a non-biodegradable by-product during biodiesel production is a major concern to the emerging biodiesel industry. many microbes in natural environments have the ability to utilize glycerol as a sole carbon and energy source. the focus of this study was to screen for microorganisms from soil, capable of glycerol utilization and its conversion to value added products such as ethanol and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pdo). twelve bacterial isolates were screened for glycerol utilization ability in shake flask fermentations using m9 media supplemented with analytical grade glycerol (30 g/l) at various ph values (6, 7 and 8) and temperatures (30 degrees c, 35 degrees c and 40 degrees c). among these, six bacterial isolates (sm1, sm3, sm4, sm5, sm7 and sm8) with high glycerol degradation efficiency (>80%) were selected for further analysis. highest level of 1,3-pdo production (15 g/l) was observed with isolate sm7 at ph  7 and 30 degrees c, while superior ethanol production (14 g/l) was achieved by isolate sm9 at ph 8 and 35 degrees c, at a glycerol concentration of 30 g/l. the  selected strains were further evaluated for their bioconversion efficiency at elevated glycerol concentrations (50-110 g/l). maximum 1,3-pdo production (46 g/l and 35 g/l) was achieved at a glycerol concentration of 70 g/l by isolates sm4 and sm7 respectively, with high glycerol degradation efficiency (>90). three isolates (sm4, sm5 and sm7) also showed greater glycerol tolerance (up to 110 g/l). the isolates sm4 and sm7 were identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and sm5 as enterobacter aerogenes by 16s rdna analysis. these novel isolates with greater glycerol tolerance could be used for the biodegradation of glycerol waste generated from the biodiesel industry into value-added commercial products.

TI  == [the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  == objective: to study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. methods: the clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from december 2005 to december 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from january 2009 to january 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups.  results: the incidence of vap in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (p > 0.05) was observed. gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. however, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens  in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were  klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (p < 0.05). the risk factors of vap include the duration of mechanical ventilation (or = 5.680, 95% ci: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (or = 2.219, 95% ci: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (or = 2. 127, 95% ci: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (or = 2.025, 95% ci: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (or = 2.012, 95% ci: 1.215-3.967). conclusions: according to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria  of vap were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. the incidence of vap was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel incompatibility group x3 plasmid carrying bla ndm-1 in enterobacteriaceae isolates with epidemiological links to multiple geographical areas in china.
AB  == the new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (ndm-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in enterobacteriaceae. we characterized nine bla ndm-1 producing enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in india (n=1) or mainland china (n=6) during december  2010-may 2012. all the china-linked patients had no links to the indian subcontinent. the bla ndm-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel incx3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two escherichia coli, two klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one enterobacter aerogenes and one e. cloacae), inca/c2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one e. coli) or fii-f1b groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one e. coli). restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven incx3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. the incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1 were epidemiologically linked to guangzhou (n=1), hunan (n=4), haifeng  (n=1) and dongguan (n=1) in mainland china. complete sequencing of the incx3 plasmid pndm-hn380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. the bla ndm-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by isaba125 and is26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. the  sequences of the bla ndm-1 containing module within the two is elements were identical to those previously described for bla ndm-1-positive tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of acinetobacter isolates. in summary, this is the first description of incx3 plasmids carrying bla ndm-1. the findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of ndm-1 in china.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

AB  == beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and ampc beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of enterobacteriaceae. emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr) determinants in esbl-producing isolates poses a global threat. the molecular characterisitcs of esbl and pmqr determinants in the philippines are not well characterized. in this study, we investigated esbls and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from the philippines, and analyzed the association between esbl and pmqr genes. a total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae  were collected at the research institute for tropical medicine of the philippines from 2006 to 2008. ampc- or esbl-producing isolates were screened by detecting a  zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. possible esbl-producing strains were assessed by the esbl confirmation test of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. pcr and sequencing were performed to detect the esbl and pmqr genes. the number of esbl-producers and ampc-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. of 17 phenotypic esbl-producers, 14 isolates had esbl genes, including 6 of escherichia coli, 3 of enterobacter cloacae, 2 of enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of klebsiella ozaenae. among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(ctx-m), bla(shv), and bla(tem), respectively. of the bla(ctx-m)-positive isolates, bla(ctx-m-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(ctx-m-3) and bla(ctx-m-14). of 14 esbl-producers identified by pcr, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrb, qnrs, and aac(6')-ib-cr, respectively. the frequency of aac(6')-ib-cr positivity  was significantly higher among ctx-m-15-producing isolates. thus, we identified bla(ctx-m), aac(6')-ib-cr, and qnr in esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae from the  philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(ctx-m-15) and aac(6')-ib-cr. local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the philippines will be required.

TI  == essential oils from moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important gram-negative pathogens. use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). the objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (pabetan). the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in salmonella lps deep-rough mutants. in addition, essential oils of thymus maroccanus and thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. these results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and  may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == quinazoline derivatives are efficient chemosensitizers of antibiotic activity in  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant strains.
AB  == amongst the three series of quinazoline derivatives synthesised and studied in this work, some molecules increase the antibiotic susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria presenting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. n-alkyl compounds induced an  increase in the activity of chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and sparfloxacin, which are substrates of the acrab-tolc and mexab-oprm efflux pumps in clinical isolates. these molecules are able to increase the intracellular concentration of chloramphenicol in efflux pump-overproducing strains. their activity depends on the antibiotic structure, suggesting that different sites may be involved for the recognition of substrates by a given efflux pump. quinazoline molecules exhibiting a nitro functional group are more active, and structure-activity relationship studies may be undertaken to identify the pharmacophoric group involved in the acrb and mexb affinity sites.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == metabolism of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate by rat intestinal flora.
AB  == anaerobic metabolism of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (egcg) by rat intestinal bacteria was investigated in vitro. first, intestinal bacteria which are capable  of hydrolyzing egcg to (-)-epigallocatechin (egc) and gallic acid (2) were screened with 169 strains of enteric bacteria. as a result, enterobacter aerogenes, raoultella planticola, klebsiella pneumoniae susp. pneumoniae, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis were found to hydrolyze egcg. subsequent steps of egcg metabolism are degradation of egc (1) by intestinal bacteria. then, egc was incubated with rat intestinal bacteria in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.1) and the degradation products were analyzed with time by hplc or lc-ms. further, the products formed from egc were isolated and identified by lc-ms and nmr analyses. the results revealed that egc was converted first to 1-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2'',4'',6''-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol (3) by  reductive cleavage between 1 and 2 positions of egc, and subsequently metabolite  3 was converted to 1-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2'',4'',6''-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol (4) followed by the conversion to 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-4-hydroxyvaleric acid (5) by decomposition of the phloroglucinol ring in metabolite 4. this degradation pathway was considered to be the major route of egcg metabolism in the in vitro study, but two minor routes were also found. in addition to the in vitro experiments, metabolites 3, 4, 5, and 6 were detected as the metabolites after direct injection of egc into rat cecum. when egcg was administered orally to the  rats, metabolites 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 were found in the feces. among the metabolites detected, metabolite 5 was dominant both in the cecal contents and feces. these findings suggested that the metabolic pathway of egcg found in the in vitro study may be regarded as reflecting its metabolism in vivo.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of pre-cut fruits sold in kano metropolis, kano state, nigeria.
AB  == one hundred and fifty (150) pre-cut fruit samples comprising of pineapples (50),  paw-paw (50) and watermelon (50) at the point of stand retail outlets were tested by standard bacteriological methods to determine bacterial contamination of the fruits. out of these 150 examined 136 (90.67%) were contaminated with bacteria. the bacterial distribution were; escherichia coli 69 (46.00%), staphylococcus aureus 29 (19.33%), salmonella species 13 (8.67%), proteus species 18 (12.00%), enterobacter aerogenes 3 (2.00%), klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1.33%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%). among the 50 pineapple pre-cuts, escherichia coli 26 (17.33%), staphylococcus aureus 6 (4.00%), salmonella species 7 (4.67%), proteus  species 9 (6.00%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 (1.33%); the 50 watermelon had escherchia coli 22 (14.67%), staphylococcus aureus 13 (8.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 5 (3.33%), enterobacter aerogenes 2 (1.33%), klebsiella species 2 (1.33%). of the 50 paw-paw pre-cuts were: escherichia coli 21 (14.00%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (6.67%), salmonella species 3 (2.00%), proteus species 4 (2.67%), enterobacter aerogenes 1 (0.67%) were isolated. the findings in this study have shown that the food vendors failed to adopt adequate  hygiene for food handling and thus, suggest that the quality of all the pre-cut fruits sold at the retail outlets were not bacteriologically satisfactory. the public health risks associated with these pre-cut fruits may suggest that these fruits could serve as the vehicles for foodborne illnesses. this study has shown  the need to educate the vendors on how to protect utensils and fruits to avoid contamination and spoilage.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
AB  == structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined  by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin  fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc  1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in brazil.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. in this study, 127 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at sao paulo, brazil, were submitted to analysis by pcr  with specific primers for bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m genes. from the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%)  morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) enterobacter cloacae were identified as esbl producers. bla shv, bla tem and bla ctx-m were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of k. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. pcr results showed a high variety of esbl groups among strains, in nine different species. the results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.

TI  == use of boronic acid disk tests to detect extended- spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of kpc carbapenemase-possessing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == we evaluated boronic acid (ba)-based methods for their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among clinical isolates of kpc-producing members of the enterobacteriaceae family. a total of 155 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 141), escherichia coli (n = 6), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 6), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) genotypically confirmed to be kpc producers were analyzed. as many as 118 isolates harbored esbls (103 harbored shv-type esbls, 13 harbored ctx-m-type esbls, and 2 harbored both shv- and ctx-m-type esbls); the remaining 37 isolates were genotypically negative for esbl production. the clsi esbl confirmatory test was positive for 79 of the 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 66.9%), while all 37 non-esbl producers were negative (specificity, 100%). when a > or =5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (ctx)-clavulanate (ca) or the ceftazidime (caz)-ca disks containing ba compared with the zone diameter of the ctx or caz disks containing  ba was considered to be a positive result for esbl production, the method detected all 118 esbl producers (sensitivity, 100%) and showed no false-positive  results for non-esbl producers (specificity, 100%). double-disk synergy tests, in which disks of ctx, caz, aztreonam, or cefepime in combination with ba were placed at distances of 20, 25, and 30 mm (center to center) from a disk containing amoxicillin (amoxicilline)-clavulanate-ba, were able to detect 116 (98.3%), 101 (85.6%), and 28 (23.7%) of the esbl-positive isolates, respectively; no false-positive results for non-esbl-producing isolates were detected. our results demonstrate that the modified clsi esbl confirmatory test with antibiotic disks containing ba is the most accurate phenotypic method for the detection of esbls in enterobacteriaceae producing kpc carbapenemases.

TI  == genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in  escherichia coli. colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. the origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. we therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the enterobacteriaceae by pcr for the presence of this dna element. the island was detected not only in e. coli but also in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter koseri isolates. it was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. in e. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of  phylogenetic group b2 and inserted at the asnw trna locus. interestingly, in k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, c. koseri, and three e. coli strains of phylogenetic group b1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements iceec1 and icekp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. different asn trna genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ice-associated colibactin determinant: asnu in the three e. coli strains of ecor group b1, and different asn trna loci in k. pneumoniae. the detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ice-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == blood culture confirmed bacterial sepsis in neonates in a north indian tertiary care center: changes over the last decade.
AB  == the spectrum of organisms causing sepsis is different in developing countries. data on the recent trends of organisms causing sepsis are limited. this study was conducted in a tertiary care neonatal unit in northern india. all inborn babies with blood-culture-positive sepsis from 1995 to 2006 were divided into two epochs, viz. 1995 to 1998 (epoch i) and 2001 to 2006 (epoch ii). organisms were grouped into early (<72 h) and late onset (> or =72 h) sepsis groups. the overall incidence of sepsis, the incidence of sepsis stratified by weight groups, the organism profile on different days of life, sepsis-related mortality and pathogen-specific case fatality rate were calculated and compared between the two epochs. out of 34,362 live births during the study period, organisms were isolated in 1,491 neonates. out of these, 89% had bacterial sepsis. the incidence of neonatal bacterial sepsis increased from epoch i to epoch ii (35.8/1,000 versus 40.1/1,000 live births, p<0.05). the incidence of early onset sepsis (eos) did not change between the epochs, but the incidence of late onset sepsis (los) increased from 12 to 16.5 per 1,000 live births (p<0.001). the incidence of bacterial sepsis decreased significantly in the 1,000- to 1,999-g birth weight groups. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes decreased, whereas staphylococcus aureus increased in incidence during epoch ii. non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli emerged as a newly identified pathogen during epoch ii. sepsis-associated mortality decreased from 42 to 20%. the incidence of bacterial  sepsis has decreased significantly in 1,000- to 1,999-g infants, with a significant reduction in sepsis-related mortality. new organisms have emerged in  recent years. the organism profile in recent years has changed, with a significant overlap of organisms causing eos and los.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == [detection of ampc beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria isolated from urine].
AB  == ampc beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by a range of gram-negative bacteria and able to hydrolyse penicillins, monobactams, cephalosporins and cephamycins, are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. they are spread via plasmids and pose a huge epidemiological and diagnostic problem. the production of ampc b-lactamases was tested in various gram-negative bacteria. of strains isolated from urine of patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, we selected those  that were resistant to third generation cephalosporins and did not produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). the production of inducible ampc was assayed by modified ddst (double disk synergy test) and that of constitutive ampc was tested on agar containing oxacillin as an ampc inhibitor. all constitutive ampc producers were also tested for susceptibility to amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazon/sulbactam, imipenem, meropenem and colistin  by the disk diffusion method on mh-agar. altoghether 119 strains (68 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 20 strains of escherichia coli and 12 strains of enterobacter aerogenes) were tested. we detected 38 constitutive ampc producers,  including primarily k. pneumoniae (17 strains), e. coli (10 strains) and e. aerogenes (4 strains). thirty-two strains were inducible ampc producers (21 k pneumoniae strains, 6 morganella morganii strains and 3 e. aerogenes strains). two k. pneumoniae strains were esbl/ampc coproducers. the constitutive ampc producers showed relatively good susceptibility to cefepim (84.2%) and carbapenems.

TI  == [recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the chu of nice (2005-2007)].
AB  == aim of the study: esbl producing enterobacteria (e-esbl+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of ctx-m beta-lactamase. so, 542 new strains were isolated in the chu de nice during the 2005-2007 period. the aim of  this work was to characterize the esbl and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. methods: every first e-esbl+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. type of esbl was determined by pcr, followed by sequencing for ctx-m and shv enzymes. typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. results: ctx-m type esbl are predominant (45% of all e-esbl+), mainly in escherichia coli (34.5%). the tem24 esbl was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and klebsiella pneumoniae  (9.4%). shv5/12 esbl was found mainly in enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). several epidemic situations were identified, with ctx-m15 in escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), shv5/12 in enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and tem in proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic  (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of tem24 producing k. pneumoniae persists  especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). conclusion: caracterization of e-esbl+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against bmr cross transmission.

TI  == horizontol dissemination of tem- and shv-typr beta-lactamase genes-carrying resistance plasmids amongst clonical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria have been isolated at increasing frequency worldwide. expression of esbl is often associated with multidrug resistance and dissemination by resistance plasmids. during a two-month period in 2000, 133 clinical isolates of enterobacterial strains were randomly collected from outpatients and inpatients at a university hospital in turkey. the esbl producing strains were determined by double-disk synergy (dds) testing. twenty esbl producing strains (15%) including escherichia coli (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2) were detected and further analyzed for their resistance transfer features, plasmid profile and nature of the resistance genes. plasmid transfer assays were performed using broth mating techniques. tem- and shv- genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and hybridization using specific probes. ecori restriction enzyme analyses of r plasmids were used in the detection of epidemic plasmids. fourteen plasmid profiles (a, b1, b2, c1, and c2  to l) were obtained with ecori restriction enzyme analysis. most of these plasmids were detected to carry both tem- and shv-derived genes by pcr, and confirmed by localizing each gene by hybridization assay. epidemiological evidence indicated that there was an apparent horizontal dissemination of conjugative r plasmids among multidrug-resistant enterobacterial genera and species in this hospital.

TI  == wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of dendrophthoe falcata (l.f) ettingsh.
AB  == dendrophthoe falcata (l.f) ettingsh (loranthaceae) of the order santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. in this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. the ethanolic extract of aerial parts of dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (dfee) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. the results showed that dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. three of the fractions a-c (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeroginosa, serratia marcescens, and five fungi candida albicans, candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria escherichia coli, and salmonella typhi. the results also indicated that dfee possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the  catalase activity.

TI  == membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. these phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a multi drug resistant phenotype (mdr). in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of mdr isolates. these bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete  shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). the combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in  bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. mara and rama are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the mdr phenotype. mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. in addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the mdr response. this phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. these effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, mara, rama, or target other genes located downstream  in the regulation cascade.

TI  == a tripartite efflux pump involved in gastrointestinal colonization by klebsiella  pneumoniae confers a tolerance response to inorganic acid.
AB  == the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of patients by the opportunistic gram-negative bacillus klebsiella pneumoniae generally occurs prior to the development of nosocomial infections. mutant strain c-81 was isolated owing to its reduced capacity to colonize the digestive tract in a murine model following  transposon mutagenesis (n. maroncle, d. balestrino, c. rich, and c. forestier, infect. immun. 70:4729-4734, 2002). nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the  transposon had inserted into the first open reading frame, eefa, of a three-gene  locus (eefabc) whose homologue encodes a tripartite efflux pump in enterobacter aerogenes (m. masi, j. m. pages, c. villard, and e. pradel, j. bacteriol. 187:3894-3897, 2005), and this operon includes an additional short (183-bp) potential open reading frame, eefx, upstream of eefa. in vivo assays showed that  a deltaeefa isogenic mutant strain normally colonized the gastrointestinal tract  in single-strain tests but was significantly impaired in competition against wild-type strain lm21. although the cecum was the compartment with the highest number of cfu, the deltaeefa mutant also was detected in the stomach in numbers smaller than those of the wild-type strain. the expression of this potential efflux pump could not be linked to any antimicrobial drug resistance phenotype, but it conferred on the bacteria an acid tolerance response to inorganic acid. the expression of the eef promoter region, measured via a lacz reporter construction, was slightly induced by an acidic environment and also by hyperosmolarity but not by the presence of bile salts. these results suggest that an efflux pump can confer measurable ecological benefits on k. pneumoniae in an environment with high competition potential.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == clinical experience of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae producing  vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a greek university hospital.
AB  == background: the dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to mbl-producing isolates were analyzed. methods: during a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an mbl-producing strain  belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. we screened for mbl production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. results: fourteen cases of bacteremia and  3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an mbl-producing isolate were studied. most of the patients had previously been colonized with an mbl-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. the isolated pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/ml) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(vim-1) cluster in all isolates. among the 12 k. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have  failed. twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. the attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. conclusions: mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the mic of carbapenems. colonization with an mbl-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.

TI  == molecular and descriptive epidemiologyof multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae in hospitalized infants.
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mdre) in hospitalized infants. methods: from 2000 through 2005, active surveillance cultures for mdre were performed for patients admitted  to a 40-bed neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) that provides care for critically ill infants 6 months of age or younger. mdre epidemiology and the genetic relatedness of mdre strains determined by repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. results: active surveillance cultures revealed that 759 (23%) of 3,370 nicu infants (or approximately 1 in 5) developed mdre colonization or infection and that 613 (72%) of the 853 isolates with epidemiologic data available were healthcare acquired. mdre colonization occurred more frequently (in 653 infants [86%]) than did mdre infection (in 106 [14%]). of the 653 infants with mdre colonization, 119 (18%) eventually became infected, with 29 (4%) acquiring sterile site infections. the most commonly isolated organisms were the  enterobacter species, accounting for 612 (71%) of the 862 isolates. molecular epidemiologic analysis revealed that genetic-relatedness clustering (related clusters defined as having a genetic similarity coefficient greater than 95%) varied depending on microbial species. clustering was detected for 36 (78%) of the 46 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 22 (45%) of the 49 enterobacter cloacae isolates, and 13 (59%) of the 22 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. conclusion: hospitalized infants are at significant risk of acquiring mdre, specifically enterobacter species, at the study institution. active surveillance cultures identified colonized patients who likely contributed to the institutional reservoir of mdre. molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that both patient-to-patient transmission and de novo acquisition of resistance play a role in the acquisition of these organisms, and that the clinical significance of such acquisition varies by species. the high percentage of e. aerogenes isolates that  demonstrated genetic clustering suggests that monitoring the prevalence of this organism could serve as a useful measure of compliance with infection control procedures.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

AB  == pcr analysis of 16s-23s internal transcribed spacer (pcr ribotyping) and trna intergenic spacer (tdna-pcr) were evaluated for their effectiveness in identification of clinical strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and differentiation with related species. for this purpose both methods were applied to forty-three clinical isolates biochemically identified as k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae isolated from patients clinical specimens attended at five hospitals in three brazilian cities. references strains of k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and enterobacter aerogenes were also analyzed. both pcr methods showed specific patterns for each species. a conserved pcr ribotype pattern was observed for all clinical k. pneumoniae isolates, while differing from other related analyzed species. tdna-pcr revealed  five distinct patterns among the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates studied, demonstrating a predominant group with 90.6% of isolates presenting the same pattern of k. pneumoniae type strain. both pcr-based methods were not able to differentiate k. pneumoniae subspecies. on the basis of the results obtained, both methods were efficient to differentiate the klebsiella species analyzed, as  well as e. aerogenes. meanwhile tdna-pcr revealed different trna arrangements in  k. pneumoniae, suggesting intra-species heterogeneity of their genome organization, the polymorphism of the intergenic spacers between 16s and 23s rrna genes appears to be highly conserved whithin k. pneumoniae clinical isolates, showing that pcr ribotyping can be an useful tool for identification of k. pneumoniae isolates.

TI  == substrate specificity of the oqxab multidrug resistance pump in escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  == objectives: a plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, oqxab, identified in escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against  selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. the ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. methods: the mics of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic e. coli strains, except for the presence  of the oqxab operon. a derivative of the plasmid encoding oqxab (pola52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. the effect  of the presence of the oqxab pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. results: the oqxab pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in e. coli. these included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pola52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. conclusions: the plasmid-encoded oqxab pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. these results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.

TI  == frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  == an increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. the tendency of patients in this population to acquire uti is not  completely understood. we aimed at investigating the incidence of uti in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. on admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of uti. serum biochemistry,  complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. ten  of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic uti. urine cultures revealed e. coli in five (50%), klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. the etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with uti were ba in five, pfic in three, wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. we found a significantly greater number of utis in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). the mean age of the patients with uti was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without uti (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, alt, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with uti than in those without uti. there were no significant differences between the groups with  regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, ast, ggt, bun, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and peld scores. in patients with bacteriuria, renal usg revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with uti. vcug demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. in conclusion, symptomatic uti is common in children with cirrhosis. it occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. in febrile children with chronic liver disease, uti should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

TI  == periodontal disease as reservoir for multi-resistant and hydrolytic enterobacterial species.
AB  == aims: this investigation aimed to isolate enteric rods from subgingival sites of  patients presenting chronic periodontitis lesions, and to assess antimicrobial resistance and expression of hydrolytic enzymes. methods and results: enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 20% patients, and assayed for antimicrobial susceptibility and hydrolytic enzymes with specificity to different substrates. isolates comprised seven enterobacter cloacae (43.75%), five serratia marcescens  (31.25%), one klebsiella pneumoniae (6.25%), one enterobacter aerogenes (6.25%),  one pantoea agglomerans (6.25%), and one citrobacter freundii (6.25%). gelatinase activity was observed for 75% strains; caseinase and elastase was produced by six and two strains, respectively. dnase, lecithinase and lipase were expressed by s. marcescens. most of strains were resistant to ampicillin (93.75%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (81.25%). the majority of strains were susceptible to cephalosporins and aztreonam. enterobacteria remained susceptible to imipenem, streptomycin and fluoroquinolones. resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole/thrimethoprim, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were also observed. eight strains presented multiple drug resistance. conclusions: subgingival sites from periodontal diseases contain multi-resistant and hydrolytic enzyme-producing enterobacteria that may contribute to overall tissue  destruction and spreading. significance and impact of the study: enterobacteria isolated from patients generally considered as healthy individuals poses periodontal diseases as reservoir for systemic infections particularly in immunocompromised and hospitalized hosts.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == emergence of arma and rmtb aminoglycoside resistance 16s rrna methylases in belgium.
AB  == objectives: 16s rrna methylase-mediated high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  has been reported recently in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli only from a limited number of countries. this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this type of resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae  from two belgian hospitals and the characteristics of the strains. methods: we screened for high-level gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae consecutively collected between 2000 and  2005 at two laboratories by pcr for the arma, rmta and rmtb 16s rrna methylase genes. the beta-lactamase presence in the strains was also determined by phenotypic and genotypic methods. results: overall arma genes were detected in 18 klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter amalonaticus whereas rmtb was detected in a single e. coli isolate. the rmta gene was not found. all 16s rrna methylase-bearing strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), predominantly type ctx-m-3, as well as various types of beta-lactamases. in the majority of the strains, the  arma gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of the incl/m incompatibility group whereas rmtb was borne by an incfi plasmid. conclusions: this is the first report of the emergence of 16s rrna methylases in enterobacteriaceae in belgium. the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates producing both esbls and 16s rrna methylases raises clinical concern and may become a major therapeutic threat in the future.

TI  == frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients of a newly established intensive care unit.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing gram-negative  bacteria in patients admitted to a newly established intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital. specimens of tracheobronchial aspirates for microbiological studies were obtained every day for the first 3 days of the icu stay and subsequently every third day for the rest of the icu stay. pcr analysis  and nucleotide sequencing were performed to identify bacteria that had mbl genes. thirty-five patients (20 male, 15 female) were hospitalized during the initial 3  month period of functioning of the icu. colonization of the lower respiratory tract by gram-negative bacteria was found in 29 of 35 patients (83 %) during the  first 6-20 days (median 13 days) following admission to the icu (13 patients with acinetobacter baumannii, ten with pseudomonas aeruginosa, three with enterobacter aerogenes, two with klebsiella pneumoniae and one with stenotrophomonas maltophilia). six of 29 patients (21 %) colonized with gram-negative bacteria had bla(vim-2)-positive p. aeruginosa isolates; one of these patients developed clinical infection due to this micro-organism. previous use of carbapenems (p=0.01) or other beta-lactams (p=0.03), as well as a stay in the icu of >20 days (p<0.001), were associated with colonization with bla(vim-2)-producing p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, colonization by gram-negative bacteria of the respiratory tract of patients in this newly established icu was common (83 %). use of beta-lactams, including carbapenems, was associated with subsequent colonization of the respiratory tract with mbl-positive p. aeruginosa.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

(35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == effect of 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine, a novel putative efflux pump inhibitor, on antimicrobial drug susceptibility in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae other than escherichia coli.
AB  == objectives: 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp) has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance (mdr) in escherichia coli overexpressing rnd type efflux pumps, but there is no data on its activity in enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibilities of laboratory strains and 167 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae to a variety of antimicrobial agents were determined in the absence and presence of nmp and, for comparison, of phe-arg-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), another putative efflux pump inhibitor (epi). a 4-fold or greater reduction of the mic after epi addition was considered significant. results: nmp consistently reduced the mic of linezolid in citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. significant effects of nmp addition in >50% of tested isolates were also seen for levofloxacin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol in e. aerogenes, and for levofloxacin and tetracycline in k. pneumoniae, whereas no or minor effects were observed in serratia marcescens. mdr reversal by nmp was more likely in isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. in most fluoroquinolone-resistant strains the activity was sufficient to render isolates  drug-susceptible at clinically achievable concentrations. the activity of pabetan was different from that of nmp, suggesting different modes of action of the two putative epis. conclusion: nmp has moderate activity in reversing mdr in many but not all members of the enterobacteriaceae family including clinical isolates. its effects on resistance reversal depend on bacterial species and drug, and are different from those seen with pabetan.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

AB  == during a previous survey, five extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing  enterobacteria (esble) (two enterobacter aerogenes isolates expressing tem-24 b,  two escherichia coli isolates expressing tem-21 or tem-24 b, and one klebsiella pneumoniae isolate expressing shv-4/tem-15) responsible for urinary tract infections (utis) were found among 1,584 strains collected from community patients. the aim of the present study was to elucidate the route of emergence of these typically nosocomial organisms in the community. thus, the files of the five patients were analyzed over at least a decade, and potentially related esble from hospitals or clinics were examined. their enzymes were characterized at a molecular level, and the strains were typed by amplified-primed pcr, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, and restriction plasmid profile. all patients (c1 to c5) had risk factors for esble acquisition, including past history of hospitalization (2.5 to 23 months before). four (c1 and c3 to c5) had previously received antibiotics (concomitantly to 35 months earlier), two (c1 and c3) had indwelling urinary catheters and recurrent utis, and three (c2, c3, and c5) formerly experienced esble-induced utis (2 to 11 months before). the same esble and/or an identical or similar esbl-encoding plasmid was identified in the hospital ward (c1 to c4) or in a clinic (c5) where  the patients had previously resided. patients c1 and c4, infected with different  esble carrying a closely related plasmid, were hospitalized in the same unit. persistence of esble over at least a 5-year period was demonstrated for patient c3. thus, community-acquired utis in these patients likely resulted from nosocomially acquired esble or an esbl-encoding plasmid followed by a prolonged digestive carriage.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == occurrence and regulation of the ferric citrate transport system in escherichia coli b, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and photorhabdus luminescens.
AB  == in escherichia coli k-12, transcription of the ferric citrate transport genes fecabcde is initiated by binding of diferric dicitrate to the outer membrane protein feca which elicits a signaling cascade from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. the feci sigma factor is only active in the presence of fecr, which transfers the signal across the cytoplasmic membrane. in other bacteria, fecira homologues control iron transport gene transcription by siderophores other than citrate. however, in most cases, the feci homologues are active in the absence of the fecr homologues, which might function as anti-sigma factors. since not all e. coli strains contain a fec system, we determined the occurrence of fec genes in selected enterobacteriaceae and the dependence of feci activity on fecr. incomplete fecira systems were chromosomally encoded in enterobacter aerogenes strains and plasmid-encoded in k. pneumoniae. e. coli b, photorhabdus luminescens and one of three klebsiella pneumoniae strains had a functional fecira regulatory system as in e. coli k-12. the cytoplasmic n-terminal fecr fragments caused constitutive feci activity in the absence of ferric citrate. the pcr-generated mutant feci(d40g) was inactive and feci(s15p) was partially active. fecr of e. coli k-12 activated feci of all tested strains except feci encoded on the virulence plasmid plvpk of k. pneumoniae, which differed from e. coli k-12 feci by having mutations in region 4, which is important for interaction with fecr. the c-terminally truncated fecr homologue of plvpk was inactive. plvpk-encoded feca contains a 38-residue sequence in front of the signal sequence that did not  prevent processing and proper integration of feca into the outer membrane of e. coli and lacks the signaling sequence required for transcription initiation of the fec transport genes, making it induction-incompetent but transport-competent. the evidence indicates that fecirabcde genes are acquired by horizontal dna transfer and can undergo debilitating mutations.

TI  == investigations on anti-aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  == aims: to investigate the anti-aspergillus properties of bacterial products. methods and results: in the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against aspergilli. the culture supernatant and lysates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli (bl21, dh5alpha, hb101, xl blue), klebsiella pneumoniae, streptomyces thermonitrificans, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. the lysate of salm. typhi and e. coli bl21 exhibited the maximum activity against aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus niger. their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. in disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against aspergilli. escherichia coli bl21 exhibited similar  activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. the work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. conclusion: the products of salm. typhi and e. coli demonstrated significant activity against aspergillus species.  significance and impact of the study: this is the first time that e. coli has been reported for anti-aspergillus activity. it could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.

AB  == a prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the oncology, paediatric surgery and obstetric and gynaecology wards of the lagos university teaching hospital. there was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. all catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). the gram positive isolates enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. however, isolates of s. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls).
AB  == in 1983, just two years after the introduction of the oxymino-beta-lactams to the market , the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were isolated in germany from klebsiella pneumoniae strains. since then several outbreaks have been reported in many european countries and the usa, and nowadays in several places worldwide the problem seems to reach endemic dimensions, with rates exceeding 50% in some countries, such as portugal and turkey. on the other hand not only k. pneumoniae but also escherichia coli strains, with enterobacter aerogenes predominating among the other enterobacteriaceal species, are increasingly reported as esbl producers. in this review types, molecular characteristics, detection methods, epidemiology as well as interventions for therapy and antibiotic strategies to prevent and control infections caused by esbl-producing  microorganisms, are presented and discussed.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacter aerogenes phenotypically misidentified as klebsiella pneumoniae or k. terrigena.
AB  == background: enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae are common isolates  in clinical microbiology and important as producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). the discrimination between both species, which is routinely based on biochemical characteristics, is generally accepted to be straightforward. here we report that genotypically unrelated strains of e. aerogenes can be misidentified as k. pneumoniae by routine laboratories using standard biochemical identification and using identification automates. results:  ten clinical isolates, identified as k. pneumoniae or k. terrigena with the routinely used biochemical tests and with api-20e, were identified as e. aerogenes by tdna-pcr - an identification that was confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing for five of these isolates. misidentification also occurred when using the automated identification systems vitek 2 and phoenix, and was due to delayed  positivity for ornithine decarboxylase and motility. subculture and prolonged incubation resulted in positive results for ornithine decarboxylase and for motility. it could be shown by rapd-analysis that the e. aerogenes strains belonged to different genotypes. conclusions: clinical e. aerogenes isolates can  be easily misidentified as klebsiella due to delayed positivity for ornithine decarboxylase and motility. the phenomenon may be widespread, since it was shown  to occur among genotypically unrelated strains from different hospitals and different isolation dates. a useful clue for correct identification is the presence of an inducible beta-lactamase, which is highly unusual for k. pneumoniae. in several instances, the use of genotypic techniques like tdna-pcr may circumvent problems of phenotypic identification.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca are the two most frequently encountered klebsiella species giving rise to infections in humans, but other klebsiella species can also be found in clinical specimens: klebsiella ozaenae, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, klebsiella terrigena, klebsiella planticola, klebsiella ornithinolytica, and enterobacter aerogenes (klebsiella mobilis). however, many of these species are indistinguishable by the conventional methods  employed routinely in the clinical microbiological laboratory. several investigators have suggested various additional tests, but as yet there is no standardized test panel for identifying all klebsiella species and subspecies. in the present study, performed in three national klebsiella reference laboratories, we have evaluated a test panel consisting of 18 biochemical tests on 242 strains  comprising all klebsiella species and subspecies. the test panel was designed to  identify organisms preliminarily identified as belonging to the genus klebsiella  on the basis of conventional methods or automated identification systems. with the described test panel it is possible to find one or more positive test results differentiating any klebsiella species, except klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, from  its closest relative.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == resistance to imipenem, cefepime, and cefpirome associated with mutation in omp36 osmoporin of enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes develops increased multidrug resistance via a functional alteration of outer-membrane permeability associated with a decrease in porin function. we have sequenced the gene coding the major porin of enterobacter aerogenes, omp36. the sequence shows a high similarity with the klebsiella pneumoniae ompk36 gene and is closely related to the enterobacterial ompc family. sequence analysis of several omp36 issued from clinical strains indicated variability in putative cell-surface exposed domains. interestingly, substitution gly112asp was observed in the conserved eyelet l3 region of the porin produced by two strains, c and 3. this substitution is associated with a high general beta-lactam resistance observed in these isolates and with alteration of pore properties previously described in strain 3 porin [mol. microbiol. 41 (2001) 189]. this is the first genetic identification of impermeability-mediated resistance to beta-lactams in various clinical e. aerogenes strains.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in haiti.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the etiology of meningitis and sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti and evaluate the susceptibility 'in vitro' of the pathogens to the antibiotics commonly used. this was a prospective case series study over a 10-month period (may 1997-february 1998) of 42 newborns with sepsis and/or meningitis. besides the clinical signs, a positive blood culture and/or a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid was present in each case. gram-negative bacteria were most commonly found as a cause  of early onset sepsis, with enterobacter aerogenes as the most common agent. there were no such difference between gram-negative and gram-positive in late onset sepsis. group b streptococcus was associated with neonatal meningitis (44 per cent of cases) which was more related to gram-positive bacteria (66 per cent). risk factors were vaginal discharge and dysuria in mothers, and low apgar  score in newborns. thirty-three per cent of the pathogens found, among them klebsiella pneumoniae, were resistant 'in vitro' to ampicillin and gentamycin. all were susceptible to amikacin. enterobacter aerogenes is an important pathogen in the etiology of early onset sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti, while group b streptococcus is the leading cause of meningitis in that age group. resistance to gentamycin should be taken into consideration for the treatment of sepsis and meningitis in the newborn.

TI  == inhibitors of antibiotic efflux in resistant enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae strains.
AB  == in enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, efflux provides efficient extrusion of antibiotics and contributes to the multidrug resistance phenotype. one of the alkoxyquinoline derivatives studied here, 2,8-dimethyl-4-(2'-pyrrolidinoethyl)-oxyquinoline, restores noticeable drug susceptibility to resistant clinical strains. analyses of energy-dependent chloramphenicol efflux indicate that this compound inhibits the efflux pump mechanism and improves the activity of structurally unrelated antibiotics on multidrug-resistant e. aerogenes and k. pneumoniae isolates.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == occurrence & detection of ampc beta-lactamases at a referral hospital in karnataka.
AB  == background & objectives: ampc beta-lactamases confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs except for cefepime, cefpirome and carbapenems. they are known to be responsible for nosocomial outbreaks, therapeutic failures and multidrug resistance. although reported with increasing frequency the true rate of occurrence of these beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae is not known. hence  the present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence of ampc enzymes among clinical isolates. methods: a total of 520 consecutive, non-repeat clinical isolates were included in the present study. twenty eight strains resistant to cefoxitin were tested for ampc beta-lactamases by the modified 3-dimensional extract method. isolates harbouring ampc beta-lactamases were tested for inducible beta-lactamases by disc diffusion. results: sixteen (3.3%) isolates were positive for ampc beta-lactamases. based on the species 9 (3.3%) escherichia coli, 4 (2.2%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 (5%) citrobacter freundii and 1 (5.5%) isolate of enterobacter aerogenes harboured ampc enzymes. nine (56.3%) of ampc harbouring strains, were urinary isolates. all the isolates were sensitive to imipenem and variably sensitive to aminoglycosides and co-trimoxazole. interpretation & conclusion: our findings document the presence of ampc enzymes in this region. hence ampc beta-lactamase detection should be undertaken in clinical isolates showing resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  == biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. the scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. we extracted dna and rna  from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients  in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16s rrna and rdna sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. we used a modified robbins device (mrd) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated leitbakteria, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to e. coli and shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. in the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with p. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by k. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. the overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from  earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and  have similar major members, the stent leitbakteria.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == thanatin activity on multidrug resistant clinical isolates of enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == efflux pumps protect bacterial cells by ejecting intracellular toxic molecules such as antibiotics, detergents and defensins that have penetrated the cell envelope. some of these efflux pumps recognise structurally unrelated compounds (mdr pump) and account for the resistance of some organisms to two or more agents. it would be of interest to identify molecules that are able to circumvent the problems created by multidrug resistance phenotypes during antibiotic therapy. we have studied the activity of thanatin, a 21-residue cationic antimicrobial peptide produced by an insect, against three bacterial species. the antibacterial effect depended on the size of lipopolysaccharide side chains. in clinically resistant isolates of enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, the biological activity of thanatin is independent of the membrane permeability, possibly controlled by one or more porins, and/or the expression of drug efflux pumps, two mechanisms which confer high level antibiotic resistance.  in addition, thanatin was able to improve the activity of structurally unrelated  antibiotics (norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) on a multidrug- resistant e. aerogenes clinical isolate.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a french university-affiliated hospital.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to investigate the epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble) in our hospital. we determined the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in enterobacteriaceae over a 2-year period. we also characterised esbls by isoelectric focusing (ief) and investigated the epidemiological relatedness of eblse by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). during this period, 70 patients were colonised/infected with one or several strains of eblse, giving a crude incidence of 0.095 per 1000 patient-days. we found that esbl-producing enterobacter aerogenes were the main source of esble dissemination. indeed, 59.5% of esble were e. aerogenes and 21.9% of the other esble resulted from a plasmid transfer originating from e. aerogenes. ief and pfge analysis demonstrated that the dissemination of esbl from e. aerogenes in our hospital was due to a single clone that always harbours tem-24. this emphasises the importance of standard contact isolation precautions and the early detection of esble-colonised patients in high risk departments like intensive care units.

AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

TI  == the beta-glucoside genes of klebsiella aerogenes: conservation and divergence in  relation to the cryptic bgl genes of escherichia coli.
AB  == the ability to metabolize aromatic beta-glucosides such as salicin and arbutin varies among members of the enterobacteriaceae. the ability of escherichia coli to degrade salicin and arbutin appears to be cryptic, subject to activation of the bgl genes, whereas many members of the klebsiella genus can metabolize these  sugars. we have examined the genetic basis for beta-glucoside utilization in klebsiella aerogenes. the klebsiella equivalents of bglg, bglb and bglr have been cloned using the genome sequence database of klebsiella pneumoniae. nucleotide sequencing shows that the k. aerogenes bgl genes show substantial similarities to the e. coli counterparts. the k. aerogenes bgl genes in multiple copies can also  complement e. coli mutants deficient in bglg encoding the antiterminator and bglb encoding the phospho-beta-glucosidase, suggesting that they are functional homologues. the regulatory region bglr of k. aerogenes shows a high degree of similarity of the sequences involved in bglg-mediated regulation. interestingly,  the regions corresponding to the negative elements present in the e. coli regulatory region show substantial divergence in k. aerogenes. the possible evolutionary implications of the results are discussed.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

TI  == surfactant proteins a and d inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  == the pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins a (sp-a) and d (sp-d), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. in this study, we examined the effect of sp-a and sp-d on the growth and viability of gram-negative bacteria. the pulmonary clearance of escherichia coli k12 was reduced in sp-a-null mice and was increased in sp-d-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. purified sp-a and sp-d inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes. in general, rough e. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and  collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough lps vesicles. although both sp-a and sp-d agglutinated e. coli k12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. at least part of the antimicrobial activity of sp-a and sp-d was localized to their c-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. incubation of e. coli k12 with sp-a or sp-d increased bacterial permeability. deletion of the e. coli ompa gene from a collectin-resistant smooth e. coli strain enhanced sp-a and sp-d-mediated growth inhibition. these data indicate that sp-a and sp-d are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the  proliferation of gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == sequencing of 16s rdna of klebsiella: taxonomic relations within the genus and to other enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the 16s rdnas of 20 strains of klebsiella were sequenced and used for construction of a phylogenetic tree together with already published enterobacteriaceae 16s rdna sequences. the taxonomy within the klebsiella genus,  as reflected by the 16s rdna tree, was in agreement with existing dna-dna hybridisation and numerical taxonomy data, indicating that for klebsiella, 16s rdna sequencing is a valid method for identification and taxonomical purposes. five closely related clusters were found in the klebsiella genus; cluster i, k. oxytoca; cluster ii, k. terrigena, cluster iii, k. planticola and k. ornithinolytica; cluster iv, enterobacter aerogenes (k. mobilis); and cluster v,  k. pneumoniae. the position of calymmatobacterium granulomatis within the genus and closest to k. pneumoniae was confirmed. for the species k. oxytoca, data seem to indicate a subdivision into two subspecies. in addition, a biochemically aberrant klebsiella strain (bec441) that was included in the analysis could not be assigned to any of the known species, but was found to be closest related to k. oxytoca. furthermore, the high sequence similarity between the two environmental species k. planticola and k. ornithinolytica does not justify a distinction of the two species. finally, within a 165-bp stretch of the 16s rdna  sequences, species-specific nucleotides were found.

TI  == phylogenetical relationship based on groe genes among phenotypically related enterobacter, pantoea, klebsiella, serratia and erwinia species.
AB  == in an attempt to define the phylogenetical relationship among 17 phenotypically related species of genera enterobacter, pantoea, serratia, klebsiella and erwinia, we determined almost all of their groe operon sequences using the polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing method. the number of nucleotide substitutions per site was 0.12+/-0.030. the value was 3.6-fold higher than that  of 16s rdna. as a result, we were successful in constructing molecular phylogenetic trees which had a finer resolution than that based on the 16s rdna sequences. the phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of groe operons indicated that the members of genera enterobacter, pantoea and klebsiella were closely related to each other, while serratia and erwinia species except erwinia carotovora, made distinct clades. the close relationship between enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, that had been suggested by biochemical tests and dna hybridization, was also supported by our molecular phylogenetic trees.

TI  == carbapenem resistance in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes is associated with decreased expression of ompf and ompc porin analogs.
AB  == we investigated the mechanism of imipenem resistance in enterobacter aerogenes strain 810, a clinical isolate from the united states for which the imipenem mic  was 16 micro g/ml and the meropenem mic was 8 micro g/ml. an imipenem-susceptible revertant, strain 810-rev, was obtained after multiple passages of the strain on  nonselective media. for the revertant, the imipenem mic was </=1 micro g/ml and the meropenem mic was </=0.25 micro g/ml. cefepime mics also decreased from 8 to  1 micro g/ml; however, the mics of ceftazidime (>/=128 micro g/ml), cefoxitin (>/=32 micro g/ml), and cefotaxime (>/=64 micro g/ml) remained the same. the beta-lactamase and porin profiles of the parent, the revertant, and carbapenem-susceptible type strain e. aerogenes atcc 13048 were determined. strains 810 and 810-rev each produced two beta-lactamases with pis of 8.2 and 5.4. the beta-lactamase activities of the parent and revertant were similar, even after induction with subinhibitory concentrations of imipenem. while 810-rev produced two major outer membrane proteins of 42 and 39 kda that corresponded to  escherichia coli porins ompc and ompf, respectively, the parent strain appeared to produce similar quantities of the 39-kda protein (ompf) but decreased amounts  of the 42-kda protein (ompc). when the parent strain was grown in the presence of imipenem, the 42-kda protein was not detectable by gel electrophoresis. however,  western blot analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the parent and revertant  with polyclonal antisera raised to the ompc and ompf analogs of klebsiella pneumoniae (anti-ompk36 and anti-ompk35, respectively) showed that strain 810 expressed only the 42-kda ompc analog in the absence of imipenem (the 39-kda protein was not recognized by the anti-ompf antisera) and neither the ompc nor the ompf analog in the presence of imipenem. the ompc analog is apparently down-regulated in the presence of imipenem; however, 810-rev expressed both ompc  and ompf analogs. these data suggest that imipenem resistance in e. aerogenes 810 is primarily associated with the lack of expression of the analogs of the ompc (42-kda) and ompf (39-kda) outer membrane proteins, which also results in decreased susceptibility to meropenem and cefepime.

TI  == the inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waae gene: function and genetic distribution among some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

TI  == surveillance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble) in northern france: a five-year multicentre incidence study.
AB  == in order to measure the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esble), and to evaluate the impact of the national guidelines for multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) prevention in hospitals of northern france, a multicentre study was conducted for three months every year starting in 1996, in  volunteer hospital laboratories. all clinical specimens positive for mrsa and esble were prospectively surveyed. during the five-year surveillance period, the  overall proportion of mrsa was 38.4% in the 28,534 strains of s. aureus, and that of esble was 11.4% in the 6121 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 47.7% in the  2353 strains of enterobacter aerogenes. the overall incidence rates of clinical specimens positive for mrsa, esbl-k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes were 0.84. 0.05  and 0.12/1000 hospital-days (hd), respectively. in the 23 hospitals that participated in the survey every year, the proportion and incidence of esble decreased. hence, despite recommendations as for isolation precautions, mrsa remains poorly controlled and requires more effective measures.

TI  == helicobacter pylori may survive ampicillin treatment in the remnant stomach.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a gram-negative curved rod-like or spiral bacterium that chronically infects the human gastric mucosa, and is a major risk  factor for gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. after partial gastrectomy, some patients may have persistent h. pylori infection for five years or more. in this study, we detected three bacteria, i.e., klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli, in the gastric juice of patients with a remnant stomach. some of these bacteria produced beta-lactamase. these findings are potentially important since such bacteria could provide h. pylori with the chance to acquire drug resistance and to transfer drug resistance genes. this could be one reason why h. pylori is difficult to eradicate in the remnant stomach.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == objective: to assess trends in the susceptibility to beta-lactam agents and to fluoroquinolones of clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae isolated over a 3-year period in 14 french hospital laboratories. methods: during the second quarter of  1996, 1997 and 1998, 180 consecutive non-duplicate isolates of enterobacteriaceae were collected in each center. sixteen beta-lactams and four quinolones were tested by the disk diffusion method. in addition, the double-disk synergy test was used to screen for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). results: totals of 2507, 2312 and 2506 clinical isolates were obtained in each period, respectively. the distribution of enterobacteriaceae species according to clinical specimens and wards was similar in each study period. no significant variation in the susceptibility rates to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones was observed, except in klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes. the prevalence of esbl-producing isolates decreased from 18% to 9% in the former, while it increased from 32% to 54% in the latter. at the same time, the susceptibility to ofloxacin and pefloxacin increased for k. pneumoniae (p < 0.003) and cephalosporinase-producing species (p < 0.05), except enterobacter spp. conclusion: over the 3-year study period beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones remained highly active against enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates, with the exception of e. aerogenes, probably as a result of the dissemination of multiresistant clones in french hospitals.

TI  == development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying cmy-2 and shv beta-lactamases.
AB  == polyclonal rabbit antibodies against shv-1 and cmy-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were  developed. immunoblots revealed that the anti-shv-1 antibody recognized shv-1 but did not recognize tem-1, k-1, oxa-1, or any ampc beta-lactamase tested. the anti-cmy-2 antibody detected escherichia coli cmy-2, enterobacter cloacae p99, klebsiella pneumoniae act-1, and the ampc beta-lactamases of enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii, and citrobacter freundii. no cross-reactivity of  the anti-cmy-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of e. coli possessing tem-1, shv-1, k-1, or oxa-1 beta-lactamases. operating conditions for performing  elisas were optimized. both anti-cmy-2 and anti-shv-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in elisas. the reactivity of the anti-cmy-2 antibody was tested against a number of ampc beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in elisas (ampc beta-lactamases of  m. morganii, c. freundii, e. coli, and e. cloacae). as the homology to cmy-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). the  elisas were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for ampc and shv beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with pcr amplification of bla(ampc) and bla(shv) genes. overall, we found that our elisas were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting shv and ampc beta-lactamases. the elisa format can facilitate the identification of ampc and shv beta-lactamases and can  be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of enterobacter aerogenes ompc-type osmoporin linked to carbapenem resistance.
AB  == using outbreak-related strains of enterobacter aerogenes, we cloned and sequenced ompk39, the structural gene coding for outer membrane protein ompk39. its lack of expression was closely associated with a phenotype exhibiting low-level carbapenem resistance. detailed alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed that ompk39 is a member of the ompc subclass of enterobacterial porins,  with the highest degree of homology to klebsiella pneumoniae ompk36. based on a computerized alignment including escherichia coli phoe and ompf, the 3d structures of which are known from x-ray studies, ompk39 can be assumed to form the typical beta-barrel structure which is common to all enterobacterial porins.  since no inhibitory dna sequences could be detected in ompk39 in the resistant strains, porin deficiency leading to carbapenem resistance seems to involve alterations in key regulatory genes and/or the promotor sequence rather than a direct mutation in the structural gene.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

AB  == objective: to isolate and identify microorganisms from cockroaches that were captured in a public hospital and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of these microorganisms. methods: cockroaches were captured in the morning and at night. they were placed in flasks rinsed with 70% alcohol, transferred to sterilized flasks, and then taken to the laboratory. only cockroaches captured whole and live were utilized for the study. after being immobilized at 0 degree c, each cockroach was placed in a test tube with sterile saline solution (0.8%) and then homogenized. the resulting solution was then placed in the following five culture media: macconkey agar, nutrient broth, brain-heart infusion agar, sabouraud agar, and mannitol. the cultures were examined using a stereomicroscope, and colony-forming units were counted. the disk diffusion test  was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. results: we found a 56% prevalence of enterobacteria and an 18% prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci. fifteen species of enterobacteria were identified. the most frequent were klebsiella pneumoniae (17%), enterobacter aerogenes (14%), serratia marcescens (13%), hafnia alvei (12%), enterobacter gergoviae and enterobacter cloacae (each 9%), and serratia spp. (6%). both the enterobacteria and the coagulase-negative staphylococci showed significant resistance to antimicrobials, including oxacillin. conclusions: the prevalence of enteropathogenic bacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from periplaneta americana cockroaches  in the studied hospital reflects the weakness of the measures adopted both for vector control and for antimicrobial use. the results show the need to implement  effective health-institution programs focusing on hygiene and the rational use of antimicrobials.

AB  == phylogenetic trees showing the evolutionary relatedness of enterobacteriaceae based upon gyrb and 16s rrna genes were compared. congruence among trees of these molecules indicates that the genomes of these species are not completely mosaic and that molecular systematic studies can be carried out. phylogenetic trees based on gyrb sequences appeared to be more reliable at determining relationships among serratia species than trees based on 16s rrna gene sequences. gyrb sequences from serratia species formed a monophyletic group validated by significant bootstrap values. serratia fonticola had the most deeply branching gyrb sequence in the serratia monophyletic group, which was consistent with its atypical phenotypic characteristics. klebsiella and enterobacter genera seemed to be polyphyletic, but the branching patterns of gyrb and 16s rrna gene trees were  not congruent. enterobacter aerogenes was grouped with klebsiella pneumoniae on the gyrb phylogenetic tree, which supports that this species could be transferred to the klebsiella genus. unfortunately, 16s rrna and gyrb phylogenetic trees gave conflicting evolutionary relationships for citrobacter freundii because of its unusual gyrb evolutionary process. gyrb lateral gene transfer was suspected for hafnia alvei. saturation of gyrb genes was observed by the pairwise comparison of proteus spp., providencia alcalifaciens and morganella morganii sequences. depending on their level of variability, 16s rrna gene sequences were useful for  describing phylogenetic relationships between distantly related enterobacteriaceae, whereas gyrb sequence comparison was useful for inferring intra- and some intergeneric relationships.

TI  == tem derivative-producing enterobacter aerogenes strains: dissemination of a prevalent clone.
AB  == tem-24 (caz-6) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was detected in 1988 in clermont-ferrand, france, in klebsiella pneumoniae (bla(tem-24)) and enterobacter aerogenes (bla(tem-24b)), and since 1994, a tem-24-producing e. aerogenes clonal  strain has been observed elsewhere in the country. to determine if the spread of  this clonal strain was restricted to tem-24-producing e. aerogenes strains, 84 e. aerogenes strains (non-tem/shv-producing strains, tem-1- or -2-producing strains, and different esbl-producing strains), isolated from 1988 to 1999 in clermont-ferrand (n = 59) and in 11 other french hospitals in 1998 (n = 25), were studied. a clonal strain was found for tem-24- but also for tem-3- and tem-1- or  2-producing isolates. this study shows that there is a clonal strain dependent on acquisition of the tem-type enzyme (tem-24 and other tem types).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus in italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and of  staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the italian epidemiological observatory survey sponsored by the smith-kline foundation. a standardised method was used to determine the mics of 22 antibiotics against isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), escherichia coli (n=684), enterobacter cloacae (n=342), enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the mics of 11 antibiotics against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). overall, the susceptibility rate of enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). during the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. in contrast, enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. of the total number of staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed  a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). rates of susceptibility of particular species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains  from different geographical areas of italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [icu] inpatients, non-icu inpatients). susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central italy. the susceptibility of escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. no significant differences in susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae or escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to icu and non-icu units. the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was higher in icu inpatients (52%) than in non-icu inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.

TI  == relationship between teat-end callosity and occurrence of clinical mastitis.
AB  == a longitudinal study in 15 herds, with a total of 2157 cows, was conducted to examine the relationship between teat-end callosity (tec) and the incidence of clinical mastitis. during the 1.5-yr study period, clinical mastitis was diagnosed by the farmers based on clinical signs. teat-end callosity was scored every month according to a teat-end callosity classification system, which discriminates between teat-end callosity thickness (tect) and roughness (tecr). differences in tect between healthy and clinical mastitis quarters within infected cows were small but significant 3 mo before (0.13 higher), in the month  during which the clinical mastitis occurred (0.08 higher), and in the following 2 mo (0.06 and 0.05 higher). to compare tect and tecr between cows with and without clinical mastitis, 199 cows with clinical mastitis were paired with control cows  based on herd, days in milk, and parity. clinical mastitis cows had more tec than their healthy herd mates, particularly when clinical mastitis occurred between the second and fifth months of lactation. clinical escherichia coli mastitis in the second or third month of lactation occurred in cows with less tec than in cows with clinical mastitis caused by other pathogens. clinical culture-negative, yeast, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes mastitis cows had more tect and tecr than other cows with clinical mastitis in the same month of lactation. pointed teat ends had higher tect and tecr than flat or inverted teat  ends. teat-end callosity thickness increased with a higher milk yield at peak production.

TI  == [spread of enterobacteriaceae producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamase and the development of their incidence over a 16-month period in a university hospital center].
AB  == enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esble) constitute with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus the main multiresistant bacteria recovered in french hospitals. our objectives were to evaluate these esble diffusion in our teaching hospital and to follow their incidence during a 16-month period, whereas a control programme (barrier precautions) had been implemented in the beginning of 1999. this study was conducted in a teaching hospital containing 1800 beds, from february 1999 to may 2000. all esble isolated in clinical or screening samples were included. duplicates (same bacteria in the  same patient) were excluded. the detection of the esbl was performed with the double-disk diffusion test. incidence densities were determined with their 95% confidence interval (ci95%). their evolution by four-month period was evaluated with the chi-square test for trend. during the 16-month period, 229 esble were isolated. the incidence was 0.35 per 1000 patient-days (pd) (ci95% = [0.30-0.40]) for the whole hospital. it was 0.47/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.38-0.56]) in medical wards, 0.29/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.20-0.38]) in surgical wards and 1.32/1000 pd (ci95% = [0.90-1.74]) in intensive care units. enterobacter aerogenes strains represented more than 75% of all esble, whereas klebsiella pneumoniae stains represented only 8.6%. during the study, the incidence of esble and the proportion of strains acquired in our hospital decreased significantly (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 respectively). indeed, between the first eight-month period  and the last one, the incidence of esble acquired in our hospital decreased by 55%, whereas the incidence of imported strains increased slightly. this study shows that the diffusion of esble concerns the entire hospital. the implementation of a control programme of the spread of multiresistant bacteria allowed us to reduce significantly the incidence of esble. this incidence seemed  to be stable for several months. the implementation of a policy which restricts antimicrobial use would allow us to complete the the efficacy of barrier precautions.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

AB  == the phylogenetic relationships of the type strains of 9 klebsiella species and 20 species from 11 genera of the family enterobacteriaceae were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the 16s rrna and rpob genes. the sequence data were phylogenetically analysed by the neighbourjoining and parsimony methods. the phylogenetic inference of the sequence comparison confirmed that the genus klebsiella is heterogeneous and composed of species which form three clusters that also included members of other genera, including enterobacter aerogenes, erwinia clusters i and ii and tatumella. cluster i contained the type strains of klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae. cluster ii contained klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella planticola, klebsiella trevisanii and klebsiella terrigena, organisms characterized by growth at 10 degrees c and utilization of l-sorbose as carbon source. cluster iii contained klebsiella oxytoca. the data from the sequence analyses along with previously reported biochemical and dna-dna hybridization data support the division of the genus klebsiella into two genera and one genogroup. the name raoultella is proposed as a genus name for species of cluster ii and emended definitions of klebsiella species are proposed.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

TI  == role of infection control measures in limiting morbidity associated with multi-resistant organisms in critically ill patients.
AB  == a retrospective comparative study was performed to determine the impact of infection control measures (icms) on colonization and infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae (producing transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, kpesbl), and multi-resistant enterobacter aerogenes (mrea) in intensive care unit patients. infection control measures included surveillance cultures, isolation procedures and mupirocin for mrsa nasal carriage. the numbers of patients infected and/or colonized by mrsa, kpesbl or mrea were compared during two consecutive one-year periods (period 1 before icms, and period 2 after icms). the antibiotic consumption during the two periods was analysed. in period 1 and period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 15% and 6.8% (p=0.001); by mrsa 7.7% and 2.6% (p=0. 004); by  kpesbl 1.7% and 0% (p=0.25); and by mrea 5.6% and 4.3% (p=0. 47). during period 2, there was a clear-cut decrease in the percentage of patients infected by mrsa  (p=0.018), a non-significant decrease in those infected by kpesbl (p=0.06), and no decrease in patients infected by mrea (p=0.22). when calculated per 1000 patient-days, for period 1 and period 2, respectively, the rate of patients infected or colonized by at least one of the three organisms was 11.9 and 8.8; for mrsa it was 4 and 2.2; for kpesbl it was 1 and 0; and for mrea it was 4 and 4. antibiotic cost was pound98.7 in period 1 and pound62.7 in period 2. icms contributed to the control of infections and colonizations due to mrsa and kpesbl but not those due to mrea.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above mic at different creatinine clearances.
AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in gizan region, saudi arabia.
AB  == traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, bayadh and hamra. the bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and  fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees c. two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. the micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). the content of lactic acid was increased  with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). the ph dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third  fermentations, respectively. the microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lact. lactis subsp. lactis, lact. cellobiosus, klebsiella oxytoca, kl. pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent. sakazakii, serratia marcescens and ser. odourifera), moulds (penicillium sp., rhizopus sp.,  aspergillus niger, alternaria sp., fusarium sp. and mucor sp.) and yeasts (candida parapsilosis, c. orvegnsis and rhodotorula glutinis).

AB  == a strain of pseudomonas putida that utilized the biogenic organophosphonate 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole carbon and energy, nitrogen and phosphorus source contained 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid: pyruvate aminotransferase and phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) activities which were inducible by the presence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid in the culture medium, regardless  of the phosphate status of the cells. neither of these activities were induced in their phosphate-free or phosphate-replete medium in the absence of 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid. alkaline phosphatase activity was induced in phosphate limited medium, however, indicating a phosphate-starvation inducible response. in enterobacter aerogenes ifo 12010, 2-aminoethylphosphonate: pyruvate  aminotransferase and phosphonatase activities were induced only when cells were both phosphate limited and supplied with 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as sole phosphorus source for growth. neither enzyme activity was induced in phosphate-replete medium, or in medium where both 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid and inorganic phosphate were supplied as sources of phosphorus. the results point to  the presence of a substrate inducible 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid biodegradation  pathway in the isolated strain of pseudomonas putida. uniquely, therefore, the pathway is not under pho regulon control in this strain.

AB  == qualitative changes in the culturable, aerobic bacterial flora isolated from the  tammar pouch have been documented over the period leading up to oestrus, at the time of anticipated birth and in absence and presence of pouch young of varying ages. in a group of 12 animals studied thirty species of aerobic bacteria were isolated. twenty five species were found in pouches with no pouch young, 9 in pouches with young less than 3 weeks of age and 9 in pouches containing older animals. gram positive organisms including corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequent isolates, regardless of reproductive status. whilst gram-negative rods klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli were found in pouches with and without pouch young, but not in pouches close to oestrus, at the time of birth or in the presence of very young animals (< 6 days). while pouches without  pouch young displayed the greatest diversity of bacterial species, there were still significant numbers of bacterial species in those containing pouch young. results suggest that the microbial population of the tammar pouch does not seriously compromise the well-being of the young animal during crucial stages of  immunological development. the data are consistent with observations on the microflora of the quokka pouch but not with data from the koala.

AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == molecular epidemiological study of nosocomial enterobacter aerogenes isolates in  a belgian hospital.
AB  == in 1995, the rate of isolation of enterobacter aerogenes in the saint-pierre university hospital in brussels, belgium, was higher than that in the preceding years. a total of 45 nosocomial e. aerogenes strains were collected from 33 patients of different units during that year, and they were isolated from 19 respiratory specimens, 13 pus specimens, 7 blood specimens, 4 urinary specimens,  1 catheter specimen, and 1 heparin vial. the strains were analyzed to determine their epidemiological relatedness and were characterized by their antibiotic resistance pattern determination, plasmid profiling, and genomic fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). the majority of the strains (82%) were multiply resistant to different commonly used  antibiotics. two major plasmid profiles were found: most strains (64%) harbored two plasmids of different sizes, whereas the others (20%) contained a single plasmid. pfge with spei and/or xbai restriction enzymes revealed that a single clone (80%) was responsible for causing infections or colonizations throughout the year, and this result was concordant with those obtained by plasmid profiling, with slight variations. by comparing the results of these three methods, pfge and plasmid profiling were found to be the techniques best suited for investigating the epidemiological relatedness of e. aerogenes strains, and they are therefore proposed as useful tools for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by this organism.

TI  == chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis (cf09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (mic >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated mic of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. two  beta-lactamases with apparent pis of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an ampc-type beta-lactamase with a pi of 9.0. amplification by pcr with primers for  ampc genes (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii) of  a 756-bp dna fragment from strain cf09 was obtained only with c. freundii-specific primers. hybridization results showed that the ampc gene is only chromosomally located while the tem gene is plasmid located. after cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that  this ampc gene is close to blacmy-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions glu --> gly at position 22, trp --> arg at position 201, and ser --> asn at position 343. ampc beta-lactamases derived from that of c. freundii (lat-1, lat-2, bil-1, and cmy-2) have been found in klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, and enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. this is the first example of a chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase observed in p. mirabilis. we suggest that it be  designated cmy-3.

TI  == a mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  == a new method, called the mixed culture recovery (mcr) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of  largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable  cells. the mcr method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two  easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. in repeated experiments with strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, and salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. these results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.

TI  == [occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  == in connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of mining hospital in sosnowiec from january to september 1995. among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%),  urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). the examined diagnostic materials came from intensive care unit (87.0%), casualty and orthopaedic surgery clinic (5.0%) and general surgery clinic (3.0%). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), serratia marcescens (36.8%), enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (serratia marcescens--74%, enterobacter cloacae--21%, enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, escherichia coli--5%). susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of karbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and cefamycyn). in case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of an outbreak due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in a french hospital.
AB  == between june 1992 and june 1993, 128 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (123 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 citrobacter diversus) were collected in a french university hospital. these isolates were recovered mainly from patients hospitalized in intensive care and neurosurgery units. the 128 strains were divided into 14 antibiotypes (atbs; atb1 to atb14); 102 of 103 nonredundant isolates were shown to produce an shv-4-related extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (pl 7.8, hybridization with a blashv probe); the remaining strain (kp 2108) produced a tem-3-related extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (pl 6.3, hybridization with a blatem probe). for representative isolates, five plasmid profiles (pl to pll-4),  eight ribotypes (e1 to e8), and seven arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction profiles (a1 to a7) were obtained. the results suggest the spread of an  epidemic strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (e1, a1, pl, various atbs) from an intensive care unit throughout the hospital. another epidemic strain (e2, a2, pl, atb4) was confined to the neurosurgery unit. other extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae of ribotypes distinct from e1 or e2 might result from the spread of an epidemic plasmid, such as reported for isolates of other enterobacterial species. conversely, they might represent imported cases, such as the strain kp 2108, which produced a tem-3-related beta-lactamase.

TI  == characteristics of the melibiose transporter and its primary structure in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == cells of enterobacter aerogenes can grow on melibiose as a sole source of carbon. this suggests the presence of melibiose operon in this organism. we found that e. aerogenes cells possess both alpha-galactosidase activity and melibiose transport activity, which were induced by melibiose. neither na+ nor li+ stimulated the melibiose transport. however, transport of methyl-beta-thiogalactoside (tmg) was  stimulated by li+ but not by na+. these findings suggest that the major coupling  cation for the melibiose transporter in e. aerogenes is h+. in fact, we observed  h+ entry into cells caused by an influx of melibiose and some of its analogs. we  cloned the melb gene which encodes the melibiose transporter, and sequenced it. deduced amino acid sequence of the transporter revealed that the melibiose transporter consists of 471 amino acid residues and the molecular weight was calculated to be 52214 da. the sequence showed high homology with the sequences of the melibiose transporters of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae. higher homology was found with the melibiose transporter of k. pneumoniae than with that of e. coli and s. typhimurium.

TI  == comparison of axenic and monoxenic media for isolation of acanthamoeba.
AB  == acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous, free-living amebae that can be difficult to isolate by standard microbiologic techniques. we retrospectively reviewed the  laboratory records of patients with ocular acanthamoebic infection for the period from january 1973 to june 1996 and found that acanthamoeba isolates were recovered from 73, 71, and 70% of clinical specimens inoculated onto buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (bcye), nonnutrient agar with live or dead escherichia coli, and tryptic soy agar (tsa) with horse or sheep blood, respectively. we then prospectively compared the recovery of a corneal isolate of acanthamoeba on commercial media from remel and bbl (tsa with 5% sheep blood, tsa with 5% horse blood, tsa with 5% rabbit blood, v agar, chocolate agar, bcye, and  selective bcye with polymyxin b, anisomycin, and vancomycin) and on axenic and monoxenic media prepared with live or dead bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). good recovery of trophozoites was obtained on bcye, tsa with rabbit blood, tsa with horse blood, and remel tsa with sheep blood. bbl tsa with horse blood or rabbit blood provided good recovery of cysts. all species of live or dead bacteria yielded good recovery of trophozoites; however, only nonnutrient agar with live p. aeruginosa, live e. aerogenes, or live s. maltophilia gave good recovery of cysts. tsa with either rabbit blood or horse blood, bcye, and nonnutrient agar prepared with live p. aeruginosa, e. aerogenes, or s. maltophilia offer optimal recovery of acanthamoeba.

TI  == the nucleoside-specific tsx channel from the outer membrane of salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and dna sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  == the escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. we cloned the structural genes of the tsx proteins from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them  in an e.coli tsx mutant. the heterologous tsx proteins fully substituted the e.coli tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin  uptake, and as receptor for colicin k. the tsx proteins from k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from s. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. the nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from s. typhimurium, k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes was established. each of the tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence  peptides and the predicted mature forms of the tsx proteins have a calculated m(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. multiple sequence alignments between the tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one  of these hypervariable domains in the s. typhimurium tsx protein. when this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the e.coli tsx gene, the mutant tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin k receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the tsx protein within the outer membrane.

TI  == adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

AB  == to evaluate the respective contributions of patient-to-patient transmission and endogenous acquisition of enterobacter aerogenes isolates, we conducted a prospective epidemiologic study in two intensive care units (icus) between may 1994 and april 1995. we collected a total of 185 e. aerogenes isolates: 130 from  51 patients in a surgical icu (sicu), 45 from 26 patients in a medical icu (micu), and 10 from the environments in these two icus. all isolates were typed by random amplification of polymorphic dna and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr. among the 175 clinical isolate, we observed 40 different profiles by random amplification of polymorphic dna and 36 different profiles by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr. we identified a  ubiquitous and prevalent clone, corresponding to 58% of sicu and 41% of micu clinical isolates. three epidemiologically related strains were specific to each  icu and represented 17% of sicu and 24% of micu clinical isolates; unique type strains represented 17 and 29% of sicu and micu clinical isolates, respectively,  and e. aerogenes strains which were spread to a limited degree and which were isolated less than five times during the 1-year study period represented 8 and 6% of sicu and micu clinical isolates, respectively. our results show that e. aerogenes is acquired in the icu in three different ways: patient-to-patient spread of a prevalent or an epidemiologically related strain, acquisition de novo of a strain from patients' own flora, and acquisition of a nonendemic strain followed by occasional patient-to-patient transmission. the findings point out the importance of patient-to-patient transmission in e. aerogenes acquisition and suggest that changes in e. aerogenes ecology in the hospital have taken place during the past decade.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  == previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in greek hospitals. this resistance  is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the  acquisition of plasmids coding for shv-5 type beta-lactamase. in the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-c enzymes. the antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing shv-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. also cefpirome exhibited good activity against e. aerogenes strains with  reduced susceptibility to imipenem. these in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in greek hospitals.

AB  == in our gastrointestinal surgical intensive care unit (sicu), the large number of  patients with multiple enterostomies enhances the risk of nosocomial transmission of gut extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esble) by health care workers. a control study performed in our sicu from june-august 1992  showed an esble gut colonization rate of 70%. to reduce this rate, nursing procedures were intensified or modified, particularly handwashing, single-use equipment and waste control. to test the efficiency of these procedures, 64 patients hospitalized for more than two days from september 1992-march 1993 were  screened for gut acquisition of esble. rectal samples were taken within 48 h after admission and then weekly. after nursing reorganization, the esble colonization rate dropped significantly to 40% (p < 0.001). twenty patients (31.7%) acquired a gut esble, after a mean of 24.3 +/- 13.7 days. each patient was colonized with one, two or three esble (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes). baseline characteristics of the 20 colonized and 39 non-colonized patients showed no significant difference (student's t-test, p > 0.05). the nursing workload, estimated as a omega index, was greater in the colonized group (p < 0.001). these findings show that strict observance of nursing procedures can significantly reduce esble acquisition in a high-risk surgical unit.

TI  == control of infection with multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria in a hospital renal unit: the value of plasmid characterization.
AB  == an outbreak of infections due to multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria took place over a period of approximately 18 months in a renal unit. strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. were involved, and a variety of antibiotic resistances was encountered. closely related plasmids encoding resistance to aztreonam, ceftazidime and piperacillin, possibly derived from an archetypal plasmid of 105  kb were found in the majority of isolates examined. after limiting the use of aztreonam the incidence of new patient isolates of multiple-resistant organisms was greatly reduced. this study demonstrated how molecular studies can contribute to the control of an outbreak situation in a hospital unit by providing an impetus to reduce the use of specific antibiotics.

TI  == bactericidal killing activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against staphylococcus aureus and beta-lactamase-producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae in an in vitro infection model.
AB  == cefepime (cp) is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity and stability against common chromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.  the bactericidal activities of cp, ceftazidime (cz), cefotaxime (ctx), and ceftriaxone (cax) against reference and clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus, an isogenic pair of enterobacter aerogenes strains (wild type and a cz-resistant derepressed mutant), and a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate possessing  a tem-10 beta-lactamase were investigated in a two-compartment pharmacodynamic in vitro infection model which simulates human pharmacokinetics. an inoculum of approximately 10(6) cfu/ml was used in all model experiments. antibiotics were administered to simulate the following regimens: cp at 2 g every 12 h (q12h), cz  at 2 g q8h, ctx at 2 g q8h, and cax at 2 g q24h. human albumin was added during experiments with cax and staphylococci to simulate protein binding. samples were  removed at multiple time points over a 48-h period to determine the inoculum size for time-kill curves. development of resistance was detected by inoculating samples obtained at 0, 24, and 48 h onto antibiotic-containing agar plates. the time to 99.9% killing was used to compare drug regimens. against staphylococci, the time to bacterial eradication was significantly delayed with cax-albumin. all regimens had similar activities against the wild-type enterobacter strain; however, regrowth was noted with cz, ctx, and cax against the cz-resistant strain. there were no differences between the cp, ctx, and cax regimens against k. pneumoniae. of interest, no regrowth of any organism was noted with cp. these  data indicate that cp has activity against s.aureus and cz-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == a total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. only eight taxa, citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, c. youngae, c. braakii, c. werkmanii, citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, enterobacter gergoviae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed  both glycerol dehydrogenase type i (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. six other species, c. koseri, e. aerogenes, e. intermedium, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and k. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type i but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type ii (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type iii (induced by glycerol only) and type iv (induced by hydroxyacetone only). they were widely distributed  among the enterobacteriaceae. classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.

TI  == the occurrence of duplicate lysyl-trna synthetase gene homologs in escherichia coli and other procaryotes.
AB  == the lysyl-trna synthetase (lysrs) system of escherichia coli k-12 consists of two genes, lyss, which is constitutive, and lysu, which is inducible. it is of importance to know how extensively the two-gene lysrs system is distributed in procaryotes, in particular, among members of the family enterobacteriaceae. to this end, the enterics e. coli k-12 and b; e. coli reference collection (ecor) isolates ec2, ec49, ec65, and ec68; shigella flexneri; salmonella typhimurium; klebsiella pneumoniae; enterobacter aerogenes; serratia marcescens; and proteus vulgaris and the nonenterics pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus megaterium were  grown in ac broth to a ph of 5.5 or less or cultured in sabo medium at ph 5.0. these growth conditions are known to induce lysrs activity (lysu synthesis) in e. coli k-12. significant induction of lysrs activity (twofold or better) was observed in the e. coli strains, the ecor isolates, s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. to demonstrate an association between lysrs induction and two distinct lysrs genes, southern blotting was performed with a probe representing an 871-bp fragment amplified from an internal portion of the coding region of the lysu gene. in initial experiments, chromosomal dna from e. coli k-12 strain mc4100 (lyss+ lysu+) was double digested with either bamhi and hindiii or bamhi and sali, producing hybridizable fragments of 12.4 and 4.2 kb and 6.6 and 5.2 kb, respectively. subjecting the chromosomal dna of e. coli k-12 strain gnb10181 (lyss+ delta lysu) to the same regimen established that the larger fragment from  each digestion contained the lysu gene. the results of southern blot analysis of  the other bacterial strains revealed that two hybridizable fragments were obtained from all of the e. coli and ecor collection strains examined and s. flexneri, k. pneumoniae, and e. aerogenes. only one lysu homolog was found with s. typhimurium and s. marcescens, and none was obtained with p. vulgaris. a single hybridizable band was found with both p. aeruginose and b, megaterium. these results show that the dual-gene lysrs system is not confined to e. coli k-12 and indicate that it may have first appeared in the genus enterobacter.

TI  == the amino acid sequence of lrp is highly conserved in four enteric microorganisms.
AB  == lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) is a global regulator of metabolism in escherichia coli (j. m. calvo and r. g. matthews, microbiol. rev. 58:466-490,  1994). the lrp genes from three other enteric microorganisms, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella aerogenes, and salmonella typhimurium, were cloned and sequenced. an analysis of these sequences and of the previously determined sequence from e. coli indicated that the vast majority of changes were synonymous rather than nonsynonymous changes. nucleotide changes occurred at 89 of 492 positions but resulted in amino acid changes at only 2 of 164 positions. this analysis suggests that the lrp amino acid sequence is highly adapted for function and that almost all amino acid changes lead to a protein that functions less well than the wild-type protein.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of infections due to enterobacter aerogenes: identification of hospital outbreak-associated strains by molecular techniques.
AB  == molecular techniques were used to study the epidemiology of infections due to enterobacter aerogenes in a tertiary-care hospital. sixty-two clinical isolates were collected from 43 patients over 3 months. restriction endonuclease analysis  (rea) of chromosomal dna and repetitive-element polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) with primers based on repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) bacterial dna sequences were used for genomic fingerprinting. rea with hindiii or ecori yielded complex banding patterns that differentiated community-acquired from some hospital-acquired organisms. less complex fingerprints were obtained with rep-pcr, which also distinguished between epidemiologically unrelated strains. more discriminatory dna fingerprints were provided by rep-pcr when rep primers rather than eric primers were used. two clusters of genomically distinct isolates from patients with recent or current exposure to the hospital environment were identified by rea and rep-pcr. most isolates within each cluster contained characteristic plasmids, and some isolates contained additional plasmids. these results suggest colonization and infection with genotypically related strains of  e. aerogenes in a nosocomial setting. although rea and plasmid profiling are useful techniques for the epidemiological typing of e. aerogenes, genomic fingerprinting with rep-pcr may offer the advantages of ease, speed, and broad species applicability over existing molecular-typing techniques.

TI  == development of a continuous coupled enzymatic assay for myo-inositol monophosphatase.
AB  == myo-inositol monophosphatase, an enzyme purified from brain tissues, catalyses the dephosphorylation of myo-inositol 1-phosphate. this enzyme has become the subject of intense research interest since myo-inositol is needed for the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol in cell membranes. since phosphate contamination has always been a problem for the assay of this enzyme activity, we have developed a coupled enzymatic assay for detecting the activity of the phosphatase with no interference by the presence of phosphate. the assay is based on the measurement of inositol release after dephosphorylation and subsequent conversion of inositol into scyllo-inosose by a second enzyme, inositol dehydrogenase from enterobacter aerogenes. since the second reaction requires the presence of beta-nad+, the activity of the dephosphorylation reaction can be monitored continuously by the increase of absorbance at 340 nm spectrophotometrically.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  == chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional  rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. the intestinal  content isolated from conventional rats reduced r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced r(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. on the other hand, enterobacter aerogenes and micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced s(-)-flosequinan. the sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body  to produce r(+)- and s(-)-flosequinan.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == clinical isolates identified as klebsiella pneumoniae by the vitek, enterotube ii, and api 20e systems were recovered from a patient undergoing therapy with imipenem/cilastatin. these isolates were resistant to multiple beta-lactam agents, and some were even resistant to imipenem. analysis revealed a bush group  1 beta-lactamase, and imipenem resistance corresponded to the loss of outer-membrane proteins in strains expressing high levels of this beta-lactamase. further characterization efforts yielded abnormal but positive results of tests for ornithine decarboxylase production and motility, and chromosomal homology to  an enterobacter cloacae ampr, ampc probe was detected. these results suggested that the organisms were actually of an enterobacter species, perhaps enterobacter aerogenes. cefoxitin resistance may be a useful marker for preventing this misidentification in the future; misidentification of such organisms poses a hazard, as it may lead to inappropriate beta-lactam therapy for infections caused by organisms that have the potential for resistance due to inducible group 1 cephalosporinases.

AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == prevalence of a plasmid-mediated type ii dihydrofolate reductase gene among trimethoprim-resistant urinary pathogens in greek hospitals.
AB  == the genetic basis of trimethoprim resistance was examined in 24 klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 enterobacter cloacae, five enterobacter aerogenes and nine serratia marcescens urinary isolates from five hospitals in greece. analysis of the 65 isolates by serotyping and phage-typing identified 53 distinct strains. thirty-eight isolates (15 k. pneumoniae, 19 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes and two  s. marcescens) hybridized with a probe specific for a gene encoding type ii dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr). three of the k. pneumoniae and four of the e. cloacae isolates which reacted with this probe also hybridized with probes specific for type i dhfr and transposon tn7. two e. cloacae isolates hybridized only with the probe for type i dhfr, while a further three isolates hybridized only with the type i dhfr and tn7 probes. none of the isolates hybridized with a  probe for type v dhfr. the plasmids in transconjugants derived from 40 isolates were analysed by digestion with restriction enzymes and southern blotting. eighteen (45%) of the donors (12 k. pneumoniae and 6 e. cloacae) produced transconjugants containing plasmids of about 95 kb in size, while transconjugants from the other donors had plasmids in the range 100-185 kb. of the 18 transconjugants containing a 95 kb plasmid, 15 had similar restriction endonuclease digest patterns, although they varied in terms of the range of antimicrobial resistances which they encoded. when ecori digests of these 15 plasmids were hybridized with the type ii dhfr probe, a 23 kb common band reacted with the probe.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

TI  == imipenem resistance associated with the loss of a 40 kda outer membrane protein in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == an imipenem-resistant strain, enterobacter aerogenes ea-z, was isolated from a blood culture. outer membrane protein (omp) profiles indicated the loss of a 40 kda omp, decreased expression of 42 and 44 kda omps, and increased expression of  a 50 kda omp in strain ea-z when compared with imipenem-susceptible clinical isolates of e. aerogenes. the omp profile of ea-z was similar to that of strain ea-si16, an imipenem-resistant e. aerogenes second-step mutant selected on imipenem-containing media. a single-step imipenem-resistant mutant, ea-si8, had lost expression of only the 40 kda omp. no new beta-lactamase could be detected by isoelectric focusing, and no increase in imipenem hydrolysis was seen when ea-z was compared with imipenem-sensitive controls, even in the presence of added zinc. these data suggest that the 40 kda omp of e. aerogenes might be required for the normal diffusion of imipenem across the outer membrane.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  == the growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. four coliforms (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic e. coli strain and clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were also used. all but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. this trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. the environmental k. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower ks value than the other organisms. the  environmental e. coli and the enterotoxigenic e. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and ks values to those of the environmental k. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. the environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. growth of the k. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. these findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used  in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.

TI  == concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different enterobacteriaceae isolated in a french hospital.
AB  == from january 1988 to august 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbla) derived from tem (ctx-1/tem-3, caz-6) or shv (caz-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or  infected patients. esblas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing.  biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to  differentiate the isolates in each species. among the 116 ctx-1-producing enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven k. oxytoca, five serratia marcescens, six escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae and 1 citrobacter freundii. caz-5 has been isolated  since january 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 k. pneumoniae isolates. caz-6 was first identified in k. pneumoniae (january 1988). among the 48 enterobacteriaceae producing caz-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39  e. aerogenes isolates, three from four k. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two s. marcescens, two e. coli and one e. cloacae. during this outbreak, ctx-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (inc 7/m) or greater than or equal to 150  kb (inc 6/c) plasmids. caz-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (inc 7/m) plasmid and caz-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. these results show that strain epidemics  and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes for ctx-1, in e. aerogenes for caz-6, and in k. pneumoniae for caz-5. they also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (ctx-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.

TI  == the impact of pulmonary infections on the survival of lung cancer patients.
AB  == to determine the impact of pulmonary infections on survival in patients with lung cancer, a retrospective review of the records of 121 such patients treated at howard university hospital in washington, dc, was done. there were 77 men and 44  women; 118 were black. the mean age was 63.5 years. forty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 31 had adenocarcinoma, 18 had large cell carcinoma, 19 had small cell carcinoma, and ten were unclassified. the stages were as follows:  two patients in stage 0, 15 in stage i, seven in stage ii, 45 in stage iii, and 44 in stage iv. eight patients could not be staged at diagnosis. eighty-five patients (70%) had documented infections; 37 had single episodes; and 48 had more than one. the five most common organisms recovered were alpha/gamma streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the median survival of all infected patients was 4.2 months which was significantly shorter than that of uninfected patients who had a median survival of 12.9 months (p less than 0.05). when stage iii patients were analyzed separately, infected patients lived a median of 5.8 months and uninfected patients, 13.4 months (p less than 0.05). this study indicated that pulmonary infections frequently occur in patients with lung cancer and suggested  that they may adversely affect survival.

TI  == crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of five  broad-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly.
AB  == to better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (sba) of the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in the elderly, we administered single 2-g intravenous infusions of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and  ceftizoxime to six healthy volunteers over the age of 65 years. serum was collected over 24 h, and concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography; pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each drug.  sba was measured against representative strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. all agents tested had excellent sbas against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, often for a longer duration than would be expected on the basis of conventional dosing regimens. ceftazidime had the greatest sba against e. aerogenes and was the only agent with a substantial sba against p. aeruginosa. although ceftizoxime had the greatest sba against s. aureus, none of these cephalosporins had substantial antistaphylococcal sbas. pharmacokinetic analysis  revealed that cefoperazone and ceftriaxone had markedly different concentration-time profiles in the elderly volunteers than would have been expected on the basis of existing data from younger volunteers. for older patients, dosing guidelines for these two agents may need to be altered.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of tem-3 (ctx-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  == a total of 33 clinical isolates encoding tem-3 (ctx-1) from four french hospitals were studied. the strains belonged to seven species, klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), escherichia coli (n = 3), serratia marcescens (n = 2), citrobacter freundii  (n = 1), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). all the strains harbored an inc7 or m self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. the plasmids had closely related ecori, hincii, hindiii, and pvuii restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the  genes blatem-3 and tetc, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aaca4, aada, and dfri and of insertion element is15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. plasmid pcff04, the prototype plasmid encoding tem-3, was widespread and appeared, by southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. the plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of tem-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae may have originated in s. marcescens since pcff04 was first detected in this species.

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin compared with parenteral antibiotics in the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  == we undertook a prospective, randomized comparison of oral ciprofloxacin with standard parenteral therapies for the treatment of biopsy-proven osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms. following surgical debridement, the ciprofloxacin patients received 750 mg twice a day, and the other patients received a broad-spectrum cephalosporin or a nafcillin-aminoglycoside combination intravenously (i.v.). there were 31 evaluable patients in the ciprofloxacin group, treated an average of 56 days, and 28 in the i.v. group, treated an average of 47 days. clinical success rates were 24 of 31 (77%) for the ciprofloxacin group and 22 of 28 (79%) for the i.v. group. of the seven failures  in the ciprofloxacin group, one was due to a persistent klebsiella pneumoniae infection and six were due to relapse of the infection within 1 year of therapy.  of the six failures in the i.v. group, one was due to an enterobacter aerogenes strain which emerged resistant and five were due to relapse. the most troublesome etiology was polymicrobial osteomyelitis involving pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which five of six (83%) regimens failed. adverse reactions occurred infrequently, i.e., in 1 of 31 (3%) of the ciprofloxacin patients and in 4 of 28 (14%) of the i.v. patients, yet all reactions responded to therapy and none required protocol  deviation. our data indicate that oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy is as safe and effective as conventional parenteral therapy in cases of osteomyelitis caused by  susceptible organisms.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

TI  == in-vitro activity of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. the broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. none of the compounds was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of s. epidermidis strains. in biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. it did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with esch. coli. this observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.

TI  == comparison of sequences from the malb regions of salmonella typhimurium and enterobacter aerogenes with escherichia coli k12: a potential new regulatory site in the interoperonic region.
AB  == the male and malk genes from salmonella typhimurium, and the malefg operon and a  portion of malk from enterobacter aerogenes were cloned and sequenced. plasmid-borne male genes from both species and the malf and malg genes from e. aerogenes were expressed normally in escherichia coli, and their products function in maltose transport. this shows that the malb products from the three species are interchangeable, at least in the combinations tested. the general genetic organization of the malb region is conserved. potential binding sites and distances between them are highly conserved in the regulatory intervals. an unexpected conserved region was detected, which we call the u box, and which could be another target for a regulatory protein. this hypothesis is supported by the presence of the u box in the regulatory region of the pula-malx operon in klebsiella pneumoniae. the intergenic region between male and malf from s. typhimurium and e. aerogenes, contains inverted repeats similar to the palindromic units (pu or rep) found at the same location in e. coli. the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins showed 90% or more identity in every pairwise comparison of species.

TI  == evolution of chemotactic-signal transducers in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the methyl-accepting chemotactic-signal transducers of the enteric bacteria are transmembrane proteins that consist of a periplasmic receptor domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain. to study their evolution, transducer genes from enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae were compared with transducer genes from escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. there are at least two functional transducer genes in the nonmotile species k. pneumoniae, one of which  complements the defect in serine taxis of an e. coli tsr mutant. the tse (taxis to serine) gene of e. aerogenes also complements an e. coli tsr mutant; the tas (taxis to aspartate) gene of e. aerogenes complements the defect in aspartate taxis, but not the defect in maltose taxis, of an e. coli tar mutant. the sequence was determined for 5 kilobases of e. aerogenes dna containing a 3' fragment of the chea gene, chew, tse, tas, and a 5' fragment of the cher gene. the tse and tas genes are in one operon, unlike tsr and tar. the cytoplasmic domains of tse and tas are very similar to those of e. coli and s. typhimurium transducers. the periplasmic domain of tse is homologous to that of tsr, but tas  and tar are much less similar in this region. however, several short sequences are conserved in the periplasmic domains of tsr, tar, tse, and tas but not of tap and trg, transducers that do not bind amino acids. these conserved regions include residues implicated in amino-acid binding.

AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [pseudomonas aeruginosa and surgical intensive care units].
AB  == the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care unit (icu) is 19 per cent although its incidence in blood culture is only 3.5 per cent and remains the same even though the total prevalence of this bacterium increases. a review of the clinical results shows that this germ causes severe complications in only 3 per cent of patients. a study by epidemiological markers reveals the presence of  16 different iats serotypes in the icu, this distribution of the serotypes being  similar to this observed in ambulatory patients. the serotype 12 of ps. aeruginosa is multiresistant. in 1984, it represented 22 per cent of the isolated ps. aeruginosa, its incidence decreases in 1985 and in 1986 (14.5%). ps. aeruginosa seems weakly pathogenic for the surgical patients in the icu. on the other hand, the incidence of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens (014 imm. serotype resistant to tobramycin), enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae increases in blood cultures proportionally to their total prevalence in icu. these bacteria are probably responsible for hospital epidemics.

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial growth rates and competition affect nodulation and root colonization by rhizobium meliloti.
AB  == the addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. a  bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by r. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by r. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by r. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. bradyrhizobium sp. and "sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by r. meliloti. the doubling times in the rhizosphere for e. aerogenes, p. marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and k. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for bradyrhizobium sp. and "s. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of r. meliloti. under the same conditions, arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. we suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.

TI  == a study of the skin flora of spinal cord injured patients.
AB  == the skin flora of 11 spinally-injured patients was compared to that of 11 healthy control subjects. the perinea, groins, penile shafts and urethras of the patients were heavily colonized by a range of multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacilli.  observations on patients from admission for up to 25 days suggest that the gram-negative bacilli start to colonize the skin 2-3 days after admission. some species, e.g., citrobacter diversus and escherichia coli appear as transient organisms while others such as enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae seem to become stable skin residents. the relationship of the skin flora to the organisms causing urinary tract infections in these patients was studied.

TI  == bacteria and helminth isolates from bile and faeces of zebu cattle slaughtered for human consumption in the niger delta areas of nigeria.
AB  == random bacteriological examination of 300 bile samples aseptically drawn from the gallbladders of adult cattle at slaughter revealed the presence of escherichia coli in 30%, enterobacter aerogenes in 14% and klebsiella aerogenes in 56%. bacteriological examination of another 116 faecal samples revealed esch. coli in  60% and ent. aerogenes in 40%, while parasitological examination revealed 50-100  strongyle ova per gram from pre-rain samples of faeces, 100-850 strongyle eggs per gram for faeces collected during the rains, and less than 50 strongyle eggs per gram for dry season faeces. no salmonellae were recovered from either the faeces or bile, and no clostridium or any helminth of significant public health interest were recovered from faeces but it is still suggested that indirect consumption of bile and faeces from these animals may constitute a public health  hazard.

AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == bacterial antagonists of shigellae.
AB  == bacterial antagonism between a microorganisms and shigella sonnei strains was studied in model experiments simulating conditions of the natural aquatic environment. in these studies surface waste samples from the river vltava served  as the experimental environment. to ensure bacteriologically defined conditions all water samples were heat-sterilized prior to antagonism testing. consistently  with the literature data and author's own observations the following bacterial species and genera were chosen as test organisms to be tested for antagonism against shigella sonnei strains in water; e. coli, citrobacter, enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fecal streptococci s. fecalis and s. faecium. presence or absence of microbial antagonism against shigellae was determined in the experimental water medium contaminated with shigella-test organism mixtures of density ratios within the range 1 : 1 through  1 : 10(4). the highest degree of antagonism was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa that at density ratio 1 : 1 inhibited the shigella sonnei growth in water within 42 hours of incubation. a similar degree of antagonism was also observed with klebsiella pneumoniae at the density ratio 1 : 10(1) and with enterobacter aerogenes at 1 : 10(2). at lower density ratios the antagonism exhibited by these two species was also present, but occurred much later, i.e. after 72 hours up to 5 days. the remaining test organisms used showed no antagonistic action shigella sonnei strain in the model aquatic environment.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == microbial penetration through nutrient-saturated berea sandstone.
AB  == penetration times and penetration rates for a motile bacillus strain growing in nutrient-saturated berea sandstone cores were determined. the rate of penetration was essentially independent of permeabilities above 100 mdarcys and rapidly declined for permeabilities below 100 mdarcys. it was found that these penetration rates could be grouped into two statistically distinct classes consisting of rates for permeabilities above 100 mdarcys and rates for those below 100 mdarcys. instantaneous penetration rates were found to be zero order with respect to core length for cores with permeabilities above 100 mdarcys and first order with respect to core length for cores with permeabilities below 100 mdarcys. the maximum observed penetration rate was 0.47 cm . h, and the slowest was 0.06 cm . h; however, these rates may be underestimates of the true penetration rate, since the observed rates included the time required for growth  in the flask as well as the core. the relationship of penetration time to the square of the length of the core suggested that cells penetrated high-permeability cores as a band and low-permeability cores in a diffuse fashion. the motile enterobacter aerogenes strain penetrated berea sandstone cores three to eight times faster than did the nonmotile klebsiella pneumoniae strain when cores of comparable length and permeability were used. a penetration  mechanism based entirely on motility predicted penetration times that were in agreement with the observed penetration times for motile strains. the fact that nonmotile strains penetrated the cores suggested that filamentous or unrestricted growth, or both, may also be important.

AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == production of 2,3-butylene glycol from whey by klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == production of 2,3-butylene glycol from whey with klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes was studied. sterilization of the whey was unnecessary. acid whey required neutralization, but sweet whey did not. butylene glycol production was most efficient at 33 degrees c for klebsiella pneumoniae and at 37 degrees c for enterobacter aerogenes. aeration significantly improved yields. klebsiella pneumoniae produced more butylene glycol than did enterobacter aerogenes in unsupplemented whey. the addition of 50 mm sodium acetate to whey increased the production of butylene glycol and acetoin by enterobacter aerogenes; it also increased the production of glycol by klebsiella pneumoniae, but the increase in this case was offset by a decrease of production of acetoin.  maximal yields of the glycol plus acetoin in whey were obtained in 48 to 64 h, but enterobacter aerogenes required about 160 h for complete utilization of the lactose. highest yields were about .3 m butylene glycol plus acetoin, which corresponds to the production of about 10 kg of glycol from 380 liters of whey.

TI  == cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  == the enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by dr. pierce in 1905. the purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. a solution of 1 l of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 u heparin, and 5 meq kcl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to peptococcus anaerobius and clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis. in a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36  l over 2 days. no lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. in a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.

AB  == using a nitrocefin competition assay, i determined the relative substrate affinity index (rsai) values of nine clinically significant beta-lactamase enzymes against a range of beta-lactams. using selected beta-lactam substrates, i observed large differences in the rsai values of the nine enzymes that were sufficient in many cases to positively identify specific enzymes. i made use of the unique rsai values of shv-1, tem-1, and tem-2 beta lactamases with cefoxitin  to screen for the presence of these enzymes in klebsiella aerogenes clinical isolates. the rsai values also allow for the prediction of the outcome of beta-lactam therapy against specific beta-lactamase-producing isolates.

AB  == the chromosomal dna replication origins (oric) from two members of the family enterobacteriaceae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, have been isolated as functional replication origins in escherichia coli. the origins in the sali restriction fragments of 17.5 and 10.2 kilobase pairs, cloned from e. aerogenes and k. pneumoniae, respectively, were found to be between the asna and  uncb genes, as are the origins of the e. coli and salmonella typhimurium chromosomes. plasmids containing oric from e aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium replicate in the e. coli cell-free enzyme system (fuller, et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 78:7370--7374, 1981), and this replication is dependent on dnaa protein activity. these sali fragments from e. aerogenes and k. pneumoniae carry a region which is lethal to e. coli when many copies are present. we show that this region is also carried on the e. coli 9.0-kilobase-pair ecori restriction fragment containing oric. the f0 genes of the atp or unc operon, when linked to the unc operon promoter, are apparently responsible for the lethality.

AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

AB  == a total of 269 hospital klebsiella strains and 103 hospital enterobacter strains  showed 34 and 10 different antibiotic resistance patterns, respectively. among multiple resistant klebsiella and enterobacter strains the ap sm cm tc resistance pattern was the most frequent (k. aerogenes). antibiotic resistant strains carried r-plasmids in 27.5%. the presence of r-plasmids was demonstrable in 2.9%  of single antibiotic resistant, in 12.8% of double antibiotic resistant, and in 71.4% of multiple antibiotic resistant klebsiella strains. r-plasmid carriage was most frequent in strains of the species k. pneumoniae and k. atlantae. transfer frequency of r-plasmids of multiple resistant strains was generally higher into escherichia coli k12 recipient (10-1 to 10-2) than into k. pneumoniae recipient (10-3 to 10-5). regarding the individual resistance determinants, transfer frequency of km-nm resistance was the highest (65.1%). the lac-plasmid was demonstrable in 18 out of the 77 r-plasmid carrying klebsiella strains. r- and lac-plasmids of single and multiple resistant klebsiella strains could be transferred into e. coli and klebsiella recipients in mice in vivo. as many as 67% showed fi- and 33% showed fi+ character among the demonstrated 112 r-plasmids. regarding their incompatibility, the studied five plasmids belonged to groups fi, fii and i alpha. altogether 14 different groups could be distinguished among r-plasmids on the basis of their phage restriction capability on phage lambda and coliphages t, and another group of r-plasmids showing no restriction at all. fi+ character was demonstrated in 54.5% of r-plasmids showing phage restriction capability and in 10.9% of r-plasmids showing no phage restriction. nearly twice as many r-plasmids carrier strains were found among non-typable ones as among those typable by phages. three r-plasmids showed phage-modification among 51 r-plasmids restrictive for phages. in addition to the phage-type of klebsiella strains, r-plasmids can also be used as an epidemiologic marker.

TI  == a comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  == the sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. all bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. all strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. only non-identical strains were used. a tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. the results showed that all strains of h. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. the other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. cefoperazone had potent activity against ps. aeruginosa. differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

AB  == antisera were raised against the purified escherichia coli k12 outer membrane proteins ompa-, ompc- and ompf proteins and protein e. several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. the three general porins ompf protein, ompc protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. anti-(ompa protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. none of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein iii. pore protein preparations isolated from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloaceae and proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the e. coli k12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against e. coli k12 porins.

AB  == fermentations of 10 polysaccharides by species of the family enterobacteriaceae were examined. algin, guar, karaya, xanthan, and xylan were not fermented by any  of the strains tested. most of the activity was found in the tribe klebsielleae.  klebsiella oxytoca fermented amylopectin (97% of the strains studied), carrageenan (100%), inulin (68%), polypectate (100%), and tragacanth (100%). klebsiella pneumoniae fermented amylopectin (91%), carrageenan (100%), and tragacanth (86%). carrageenan was also fermented by enterobacter aerogenes (100%), enterobacter agglomerans (63%), enterobacter cloacae (95%), and pectobacterium (38%). pectobacterium shared polypectate fermentation (100%) with  k. oxytoca. with one exception, serratia strains were negative on all polysaccharides. these results, along with other evidence, indicate that (i) the  genus klebsiella is biochemically the most versatile genus of the tribe, (ii) because of its distinct characteristics, k. oxytoca warrants species designation  separate from k. pneumoniae, and (iii) some food additives generally considered indigestible can be metabolized by a few species of facultative bacilli, whereas  others appear to be resistant.

TI  == biotypes of klebsiella pneumoniae (sensu lato) and enterobacter aerogenes characterised by differential substrate metabolism: application of the technique.
AB  == a biochemical typing method is described for klebsiella pneumoniae (sensu lato) and enterobacter aerogenes. the technique depends on differences in metabolism of five carbon substrates--glycerol, inositol, lactose, glucose, and xylose--at two  concentrations. reproducibility is satisfactory and is monitored by the incorporation of control klebsiellae of known biotype. the method has been used for 12 months in the surveillance of urinary tract colonisation in this hospital. gut carriage of klebsiellae, implicated by several workers as a source of infection, was common among staff and new admissions. many biotypes were represented which were sensitive to most antibiotic except ampicillin. klebsiellae, all multiply resistant, were isolated most frequently from urine specimens in two orthopaedic wards. in a longitudinal study in these wards, a sequential dominance in urinary tract colonisation by two klebsiella biotypes was shown, which suggested the presence of cross infection or an environmental reservoir. confirmatory evidence was obtained from capsular serotypes and r-factor studies.

AB  == bovine apo-lactoferrin (apo-lf) was added to in vitro cultures of eight strains of coliform bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. as little as 0.02 mg of apo-lf per ml resulted in marked inhibition of growth of all coliforms. growth inhibition was lost if saturated lf or iron plus apo-lf was added to the synthetic medium. the inhibition of growth increased as the concentration of apo-lf increased from 0.02 to 0.2 mg/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae (oardc-a1), klebsiella spp. (k1-21), and aerobacter aerogenes (55-12222) and 2 mg/ml for a. aerogenes (76-2414-1), escherichia coli (60-lilly), e. coli (66-s16), and klebsiella spp. (k6-24). as the concentration of apo-lf was increased above 0.2 or 2 mg/ml, there was less inhibition of growth except for e. coli (33-c4). apo-lf at 20 mg/ml was bactericidal for e. coli (33-c4). results are compatible with the hypothesis that coliform bacteria respond to low-iron environments by production of iron-sequestering agents that complete effectively with apo-lf for  free iron. addition of apo-lf plus citrate resulted in loss of growth inhibition. the molar ratio (citrate to apo-lf) was found to be more important than the absolute concentration of either component. a ratio of 75 resulted in 50% growth  inhibition, whereas ratios of 300 and greater resulted in less than 10% growth inhibition. these results suggest that the ratio of citrate to lf would be important in evaluating lf as a nonspecific protective factor of bovine mammary secretions.

AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) by enterobacteriaceae isolated from paper mill process waters.
AB  == using selective media containing galactitol, over 130 enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from paper mill process waters collected from different localities. these bacteria were extensively characterized and tested for acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) activity under anaerobic conditions. high activity was found in representatives of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, erwinia herbicola, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter intermedius, and escherichia coli. under argon, nitrogenase synthesis was generally not repressed  by 5 mm l-glutamate, l-aspartate, l-leucine or casamino acids (0.5 g/liter). in many strains, both the specific activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute per  milligram of protein) and the activities (nanomoles of c(2)h(4) per minute) had considerably declined after 24 h. in three selected strains, activity in intact cells grown under nitrogen was unaffected by the presence during assay of 10 mm l-amino acids or ammonium acetate. all of the strains examined were tolerant towards inactivation of nitrogen-fixing activity by 1.8% (vol/vol) oxygen during  assay, and inactivation by up to 10% oxygen was partly reversible. representatives of the six taxa synthesized nitrogenase in stirred aerobic cultures, though the protein concentrations attained were lower than under anaerobic conditions. it seems reasonable to suggest that under natural conditions, nitrogen fixation is able to contribute significantly to the nitrogen economy of the cells.

TI  == formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, and c. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. edwardsiella tarda and escherichia coli formed calcite iii crystals, whereas proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation  process of kidney stone formation.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == effects of an antibacterial soap on the ecology of aerobic bacterial flora of human skin.
AB  == the effects of ad lib use of an antibacterial soap containing 1.0% trichlorocarbanilide and 0.5% trifluoromethyldichlorocarbanilide on the bacterial flora of six skin sites of 132 subjects were measured by comparison with the flora of 93 control subjects who avoided the use of topical antibacterials. each  subject was examined once. the test soap produced significant reductions in geometric mean counts of the total aerobic flora on the back, chest, forearm, calf, and foot; counts were also reduced in the axilla, but not to a significant  extent. the overall reduction by the test soap on all sites was 62% (p less than  0.001). neither age nor sex influenced the effect of the soap on the flora. the antibacterial soap also reduced the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus on the skin, mostly by virtually eliminating it from areas other than the axilla. partial inhibition of the gram-positive flora was not accompanied by an increase  in gram-negative species. the latter were found principally in the axilla; klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were the species most frequently found.

TI  == methyl violet: a selective agent for differentiation of klebsiella pneumoniae from enterobacter aerogenes and other gram-negative organisms.
AB  == three selective media for differentiation of klebsiella pneumoniae from enterobacter aerogenes on the basis of colonial morphology were evaluated. using  methyl violet 2b as a selective agent, strains of k. pneumoniae isolated from urine, fresh water, and fresh produce were tested against other members of enterobacteriaceae in addition to strains of aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of colonial morphology showed k. pneumoniae produced larger, smoother colonies than other bacteria tested. these media were developed  to aid in presumptive separation of k. pneumoniae from e. aerogenes in the monitoring of bacterial quality of water.

TI  == use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group d streptococci. all members of the enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. one thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 c. the slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. shigella, salmonella, arizona, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia stuartii all produced negative results. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. the other  remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. the use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group from other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1h-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. activity against staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. cefamandole was very active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae, with  70% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. a number of enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml.  pseudomonas species were resistant. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the enterobacteriaceae. inoculum  size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. strains of enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == isolation of a polyvalent bacteriophage for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and aerobacter aerogenes.
AB  == a lytic bacteriophage isolated from sewage was found to attack strains of aerobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, but not members of the genera salmonella, proteus, and serratia. the phage, designated phimp, contained deoxyribonucleic acid with a 50% guanine plus cytosine ratio and a molecular weight of 23.1 x 10(6) daltons. single-step growth experiments of phimp plated at 37 c on a. aerogenes a2 gave a mean latent period of 20 min, an average burst size of 103 plaque-forming units/infected cell, and an average adsorption rate constant of 3 x 10(-10) ml/min. electron microscopy of phimp revealed a phage with a flexible tail (165 nm long and 6 nm wide). the phage head had a hexagonal outline (62 nm in diameter).

TI  == comparison of the substrate specificities of the -lactamases from klebsiella aerogenes 1082e and enterobacter cloacae p99.
AB  == a potent beta-lactamase (ec 3.5.2.6) produced by a strain of klebsiella aerogenes (k. pneumoniae), 1082e, isolated from a hospital patient, has been examined. its  properties were different from those of most gram-negative beta-lactamases previously reported. the enzyme has been partly purified, and its activity against a range of substrates has been compared with that of the enzyme from enterobacter cloacae (aerobacter cloacae) p99. the k. aerogenes enzyme, although  predominantly a penicillinase, had a wide range of specificity. in addition to hydrolyzing the cephalosporins, it attacked the normally beta-lactamaseresistant  compounds methicillin and cloxacillin as well as cephalosporin analogues with the same acyl substituents. the results obtained with the e. cloacae enzyme confirmed its cephalosporinase activity and showed that, unlike the enzyme from k. aerogenes, it was relatively inactive against the penicillins.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == differentiation of aerobacter-klebsiella isolated from sugarcane.
AB  == three hundred and eighty-four isolates were obtained in the completed test portion of the most probable number determinations of coliforms in sugarcane sources. of these isolates, 88% were of the (- - + +) indole, methyl red, voges-proskauer, citrate (imvic) type and were identified as aerobacter aerogenes according to the protocol of the american public health association (1). employing 359 of these cultures, a comparative biochemical, serological, and pathogenicity study was carried out with klebsiella pneumoniae cdc no. 2211-66 type 9. more than 86% of the organisms tested gave biochemical reactions typical  of k. pneumoniae. of the other isolates, 2% were enterobacter aerogenes, and the  remaining 12% were identified as atypical, nonmotile imvic types. comparable agglutination titers were also observed between a. aerogenes and the cdc strain of k. pneumoniae when several randomly selected sugarcane strains were reacted with prepared k. pneumoniae whole cell antiserum. neither the k. pneumoniae reference organism nor selected sugarcane isolates displayed pathogenicity for mice. on the basis of all the analyses performed, it was suggested that such organisms be classified as k. pneumoniae.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  == nitrogen fixation by members of the tribe klebsielleae.
AB  == mahl, m. c. (university of wisconsin, madison), p. w. wilson, m. a. fife, and w.  h. ewing. nitrogen fixation by members of the tribe klebsielleae. j. bacteriol. 89:1482-1487. 1965.-strains of species of the tribe klebsielleae were tested for  nitrogen fixation by inoculating actively growing cultures into side-arm flasks containing a medium with a growth-limiting quantity of combined nitrogen (25 mug  of nitrogen per ml as ammonium sulfate). the flasks were evacuated, filled with pure n(2), sealed, and placed on a shaker at 30 c. growth was followed by optical-density measurements; maximal growth was obtained in 9 to 10 hr. yeast extract was then added as a source of amino acids to shorten the induction time for the nitrogen-fixing enzymes. fixation was determined either by estimating total nitrogen with a semimicro kjeldahl technique or by exposing 20- to 22-hr-old samples to an atmosphere of n(2) (15) and helium for 5 hr and then analyzing the digested sample for n(15) in a mass spectrometer. none of the 22 strains of the two enterobacter (formerly aerobacter) species fixed nitrogen; neither did any of eight strains of serratia species that were tested. of 31 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 incorporated atmospheric nitrogen. net nitrogen fixed ranged from 17 to 65 mug/ml. it is concluded that these facultative anaerobic, gram-negative, nitrogen-fixing rods should be placed in the genus klebsiella pneumoniae. the nitrogen-fixing organism tentatively classified as achromobacter n-4 should also be changed to k. pneumoniae strain n-4, because it has been found to be an anaerogenic strain of k. pneumoniae.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
