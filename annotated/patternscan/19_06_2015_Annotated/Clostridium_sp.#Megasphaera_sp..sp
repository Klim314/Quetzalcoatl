TI  == high organic loading rate on thermophilic hydrogen production and metagenomic study at an anaerobic packed-bed reactor treating a residual liquid stream of a brazilian biorefinery.
AB  == this study evaluated the influence of a high organic loading rate (olr) on thermophilic hydrogen production at an up-flow anaerobic packed-bed reactor (apbr) treating a residual liquid stream of a brazilian biorefinery. the apbr, filled with low-density polyethylene, was operated at an olr of 84.2 kg-cod m(-3) d(-1). this value was determined in a previous study. the maximum values of hydrogen production and yield were 5,252.6 ml-h2 d(-1) and 3.7 mol-h2 mol(-1)(total carbohydrates), respectively. however, whereas the olr remained constant, the specific organic load rate (solr) decreased throughout operation from 1.38 to 0.72 g-total carbohydratesg-vs(-1) h(-1), this decrease negatively affected hydrogen production. a solr of 0.98 g-total carbohydratesg-vs(-1) h(-1)  was optimal for hydrogen production. the microbial community was studied using 454-pyrosequencing analysis. organisms belonging to the genera caloramator, clostridium, megasphaera, oxobacter, thermoanaerobacterium, and thermohydrogenium were detected in samples taken from the reactor at operation days 30 and 60, suggesting that these organisms contribute to hydrogen production.

TI  == impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (uanpbr).
AB  == this study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (uanpbr). two mesophilic  uapbrs (uanpbr1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (olrs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1). to overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the uanpbr2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. the design modifications in uanpbr2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose at an olr of 25.7 g cod l(-1)d(-1). although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 l h2 l(-1)d(-1) was  achieved in the uanpbr2 at an olr of 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose. the microbiological analysis (pcr/dgge) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the  hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as clostridium beijerinckii, clostridium butyricum, megasphaera elsdenii and propionispira arboris.

TI  == microbial community diversity of organically rich cassava sago factory waste waters and their ability to use nitrate and n2o added as external n-sources for enhancing biomethanation and the purification efficiency.
AB  == water shortage necessitated south indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (bod) of  the waste waters by presently about 30%. the purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide c/n ratios, around  250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (no3(-)) and nitrous oxide (n2o) as external n-sources anticipating a better n-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants. estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16s  rrna gene clone libraries and changing co2-, ch4-, n2o releases due to the presence of nitrate or n2o suggest that acid tolerant lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (ph 3.5). they were very less or not found in the outflows (ph 7.3). assumingly, the phyla bacteroidetes (prevotella spp.), proteobacteria (rhizobium spp., defluvibacter sp.), firmicutes (megasphaera spp., dialister spp., clostridium spp.) and synergistetes (thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. anaerobes, about 400cellsml(-1) in the inflows, increased to about 10(6)cellsml(-1) in the outflows. the methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. in the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml(-1) denitrifying bacteria and up to 10(4)cfu fungi were found. despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria  nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added  n2o decreased considerably. thus, wide c/n ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the n2o emissions low by using n2o either as electron acceptor  or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. the biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more co2 and the outflow samples released more ch4.

TI  == molecular phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and its spatial distribution in composts.
AB  == aims: to investigate microbial diversity of swine manure composts in the initial  stage and the spatial distribution due to gradient effect. methods and results: samples in different locations of a composting pile were taken and analysed by using a culture-independent approach. total community dna was extracted and bacterial 16s rrna genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, restriction fragment length polymorphism-screened and sequenced. thirty-three unique sequence types were found among the 110 analysed positive clones from superstratum sample; 56 among 122 from middle-level sample and 32 among 114 from substrate sample, respectively. the sequences related to clostridium sp. were most common in the composts. one hundred and thirteen out of 121 16s rdna sequence types displayed homology with those in the genbank database. seven 16s rdna sequence types were not closely related to any known species. the middle-level sample had the highest microbial diversity, containing unique sequences related to lactosphaera pasteurii, firmicutes sp., aerococcus sp., megasphaera sp. and stenotrophomonas sp. conclusions: pile temperature significantly affected microbial community in the initial stage of the composting. microbial community in different locations is quite different resulting from gradient effect. significance and impact of the study: results of this study reveal high bacterial diversity in manure composts,  and provide molecular evidence to support gradient effect on microbial diversity  in initial stage as well.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
