TI  == oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (pos) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic e. coli, and one nonclinical strain of desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. attachment was determined in the human ht29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. pos in buffer at ph 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic e. coil and verotoxigenic e. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). l. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of l. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. pos reduced the adhesion of d. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. pos also  had a protective effect against e. coli verocytotoxins vt1 and vt2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.

TI  == caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  == caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgmp) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) to human ht29 tissue cell cultures. effects on adhesion of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. generally, cgmp exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/ml, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. the cgmp reduced adhesion of vtec strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of epec strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. the cgmp also reduced the adhesion of l. pentosus and l. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. a slight but significant reduction of l. acidophilus, to 81%,  was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either dsv. desulfuricans or l. gasseri. further investigation of the dose response relationships with the e. coli strains gave ic50 values ranging between 0.12 and  1.06 mg/ml.
