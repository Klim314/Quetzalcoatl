TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == red autofluorescence of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == red autofluorescence of plaque and its relation to fluorescence of a single species in the biofilm was studied. fluorescence images of non-disclosed and disclosed plaque of 28 first-year students were captured. the plaque samples were assessed by culture methods and studied for red autofluorescence. species capable of producing red autofluorescence were cultivated from subjects with and without  red plaque autofluorescence. red autofluorescence was observed from actinomyces odontolyticus, prevotella intermedia and from porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros grown together. the microbial findings indicated that the intrinsic characteristics of the mature biofilm itself are more responsible for the red autofluorescence than the characteristics of the single species.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common disorder characterized by increased levels of anaerobic bacteria in the genital tract. bv has been associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). the  effects of bv-associated anaerobic bacteria on hiv expression in monocytoid cells and t cells were examined. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and prevotella bivia stimulated hiv expression in monocytoid cells, whereas bacteroides ureolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus acidophilus did not enhance hiv expression. p. asaccharolyticus also enhanced hiv expression in t cells and activated hiv long-terminal-repeat transcription in u38 cells. this report suggests a mechanism by which disturbances in vaginal flora could lead to  a higher rate of sexual transmission of hiv. furthermore, this study supports the idea that treatment of bv might serve as a preventive measure to reduce the risk  of hiv transmission.

TI  == increased antibody production against gut-colonizing escherichia coli in the presence of the anaerobic bacterium peptostreptococcus.
AB  == germ-free rats were colonized with e. coli alone, or with e. coli plus lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, peptostreptococcus. the presence of peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of e. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to e. coli antigen. whereas the immunoglobulin g (igg) anti-e. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin m (igm) isotype represented true anti-e. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by l. acidophilus or peptostreptococcus but could with e. coli. we suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.

TI  == role of escherichia coli p fimbriae in intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == adherence via p fimbriae is associated with long-term persistence of escherichia  coli in the human large intestine, but a causal relationship has not been proven. in the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic e. coli strains, one p fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. both types of  fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. with two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype o75:k5:h-, the p-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; p < 0.0001). the expression of p fimbriae by 824 was also retained  during colonization. with transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of p fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. when the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. in contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant e. coli strains colonized in combination with lactobacillus acidophilus or peptostreptococcus sp. the results  indicate that p fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota. neither p nor type 1 fimbriae seemed to contribute to the ability to  translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
