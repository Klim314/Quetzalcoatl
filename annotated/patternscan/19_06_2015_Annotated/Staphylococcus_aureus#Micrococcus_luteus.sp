TI  == critical roles of sea cucumber c-type lectin in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance.
AB  == c-type lectin is one important pattern recognition receptor (prr) that plays crucial roles in multiple immune responses. a c-type lectin from sea cucumber apostichopus japonicus (ajctl-1) was characterized in the present study. the amino acid sequence of ajctl-1 shared high similarities with other c-type lectins from invertebrates and vertebrates. the c-type lectin domain (ctld) of ajctl-1 contained a ca2+-binding site 2 and four conserved cysteine residues. ajctl-1 mrna expression patterns in tissues and after bacterial challenge were then analysed. quantitative pcr revealed that ajctl-1 mrna was widely expressed in the tested tissues of healthy sea cucumber. the highest expression level occurred in  gonad followed by body wall, coelomocytes, tentacle, intestinum and longitudinal  muscle, and the lowest expression level was in respiratory tree. ajctl-1 mrna expression in coelomocytes was significantly induced by gram-negative listonella  anguillarum and gram-positive micrococcus luteus, with different up-regulation patterns post-challenge. recombinant ajctl-1 exhibited the ability to bind peptidoglycan directly, agglutinate m. luteus, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, in a ca2+-dependant manner, and enhance the phagocytosis of coelomocytes against e. coli in vitro. the results indicated that ajctl-1 could act as a prr in apostichopus japonicus and had critical roles in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance against invading microbes.

TI  == antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing bacillus subtilis kku213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of bacillus subtilis strain kku213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of a kku213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus. the antibacterial activity of the cfs precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (as) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees c, at ph 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. when analyzed by sds-page and overlaid with the indicator strains b. cereus and s. aureus, the 40% as precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kda. however, proteins larger than 25 kda and smaller than 10 kda were still observed on a native protein gel.  purified subtilosin a was prepared by amberlite xad-16 bead extraction and hplc and analyzed by nano-lc-qtof-ms. its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kda, and  it retained its antibacterial activity. these results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin a gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the kku213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of b. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. in addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin a, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the kku213 culture. the kku213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is  highly acid-resistant (ph 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing b. subtilis kku213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.

TI  == antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (nps) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of nps in aqueous medium. in this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of  silver nps and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. silver nps were prepared using an aqueous solution of pulicaria glutinosa plant extract  as bioreductant. the solution also acts as a capping ligand. during this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver nps, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus. silver nps were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. interestingly, various concentrations of p. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver nps (ag-nps-pe) was  observed. for instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of ag-nps-pe. these results clearly indicate that  the addition of p. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of ag-nps-pe and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.

TI  == type i and type ii crustins from penaeus monodon, genetic variation and antimicrobial activity of the most abundant crustinpm4.
AB  == an antimicrobial protein, crustin, is involved in the innate immunity of crustacean by defending the host directly against the microbial pathogens. by data mining the penaeus monodon est database, two type i crustins, carcininpm1 and 2, and ten type ii crustins, crustinpm1-10, were identified. the abundant crustins were crustinpm1, 4 and 7, each with variation in the length of gly-rich  repeat among its members. a few crustinpm1, 4 and 7 with deletion in the cys-rich region were also observed. furthermore, the crustinpm4 with the longest n-terminal gly-rich region was characterized. the crustinpm4 allelic genes were expressed mainly from the hemocytes. its expression was up-regulated readily by wssv infection and gradually decreased to normal level afterwards. the recombinant crustinpm4-1 (rcrustinpm4-1) isoform was produced using the escherichia coli expression system and tested for its antimicrobial activity. the rcrustinpm4-1 was able to inhibit the growth of a gram-positive bacterium, bacillus megaterium but not bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus. it also inhibited the growth of two gram-negative bacteria, e. coli 363 and vibrio harveyi 639 at lower potency. the rcrustinpm4-1  affected the wssv infection because the expression of an intermediate early gene  ie1 in wssv-infected hemocyte cell culture was reduced. it was shown further that the rcrustinpm4-1 could delay by about one and a half days the manifestation of disease by wssv.

AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == synthesis of lucifensin by native chemical ligation and characteristics of its isomer having different disulfide bridge pattern.
AB  == the antimicrobial 40-amino-acid-peptide lucifensin was synthesized by native chemical ligation (ncl) using n-acylbenzimidazolinone (nbz) as a linker group. ncl is a method in which a peptide bond between two discreet peptide chains is created. this method has been applied to the synthesis of long peptides and proteins when solid-phase synthesis is imcompatible. two models of ligation were  developed: [15+25] ala-cys and [19+21] his-cys. the [19+21] his-cys method gives  lower yield because of the lower stability of 18-peptide-his-nbz-conh2 peptide, as suggested by density functional theory calculation. acetamidomethyl-deprotection and subsequent oxidation of the ligated linear lucifensin gave a mixture of lucifensin isomers, which differed in the location of their disulfide bridges only. the dominant isomer showed unnatural pairing of  cysteines [c1-6], [c3-5], and [c2-4], which limits its ability to form alpha-helical structure. the activity of isomeric lucifensin toward bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and micrococcus luteus was lower than that of the natural lucifensin. the desired product native lucifensin was prepared from this isomer using a one-pot reduction with dithiotreitol and subsequent air oxidation in slightly alkaline medium.

AB  == hybridizing of different antimicrobial peptides (amps) has been a common practice for obtaining novel hybrid amps with elevated antibacterial activity but minimized cytotoxicity. the hybrid peptides melittin (1-13)-ll37 (17-30) (m-l) combining the hydrophobic n-terminal fragment of melittin (m) with the core antibacterial fragment of ll37 (l), was designed for the first time to explore its antibacterial activity and hemolytic activity against bacteria and sheep erythrocyte respectively. results showed that m-l had an even more potent antibacterial activity against all indicator strains (especially gram-positive bacteria) than m and l, whereas didn't exhibit hemolytic activity to sheep erythrocytes, implying m-l can be served as a potential therapeutic drug to substitute traditional antibiotics. however the high expense of biosynthesis limited its further research, therefore fusion expression of m-l was carried out  in escherichia coli (e. coli) for overproducing the hybrid peptide so as to solve the problem. the dna sequence encoding m-l with preferred codons was cloned into  the pet-sumo vector for protein expression in e. coli bl21 (de3). after iptg induction, approximately 165 mg soluble fusion protein sumo-m-l was recovered per liter supernatant of the fermentation ultrasonic lysate using ni-nta sepharose column (92 % purity). and 23 mg recombinant m-l was obtained per liter culture after cleavage of sumo protease and purification of ni-nta sepharose column. in sum, this research not only supplied an effective approach for overproducing hybrid peptide m-l, but paved the way for its further exploration on pharmaceutical potential and medical importance.

TI  == amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane  selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.

TI  == structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee macropis fulvipes (hymenoptera: melittidae).
AB  == a novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (mac-1) with sequence gly-phe-gly-met-ala-leu-lys-leu-leu-lys-lys-val-leu-nh2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee macropis fulvipes. mac-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. a series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. the antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against  human red blood cells was decreased. the activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the n-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin.  data obtained by cd spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an  amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. in addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions  in mac-1 using nmr spectroscopy.

AB  == a 3.4 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the yfgap (yellowfin tuna glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related antimicrobial peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide (sjgap). sjgap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 1.2-17.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli d31, and vibrio parahaemolyticus (mecs, 3.1-12.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec, 16.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. according to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists  of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel  beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. this peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. these results suggest that sjgap acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. sjgap is another gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays  an important role for gapdh in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.

AB  == extracts from five indigenous palestinian medicinal plants including rosmarinus officinalis, pisidium guajava, punica granatum peel, grape seeds and teucrium polium were investigated for antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities against eight microorganisms, using well diffusion method. the microorganisms included six bacterial isolates (i.e. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginos, klebsiella pneumonia, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and two fungal isolates (i.e. candida albicans and aspergillus niger). a  standard antioxidant assay was performed on the plant extracts to assess their capability in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph). of the five tested plant extract, only rosmarinus offcinalis extract contained significant antimicrobial activity against all eight microbial isolates including pseudomonas aeruginosa. extracts from other four plants exhibited a variable antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms, except pseudomonas aeruginosa. significant antioxidant activity was detected in all plant extracts. however, extracts from pisidium guajava leaves contained significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts tested. the antimicrobial and scavenging activities detected in this in vitro study in extracts from the five palestinian  medicinal plants suggest that further study is needed to identify active compounds to target diseases caused by a wide-spectrum pathogens.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == development of an informatics platform for therapeutic protein and peptide analytics.
AB  == the momentum gained by research on biologics has not been met yet with equal thrust on the informatics side. there is a noticeable lack of software for data management that empowers the bench scientists working on the development of biologic therapeutics. sarvision|biologics is a tool to analyze data associated with biopolymers, including peptides, antibodies, and protein therapeutics programs. the program brings under a single user interface tools to filter, mine, and visualize data as well as those algorithms needed to organize sequences. as part of the data-analysis tools, we introduce two new concepts: mutation cliffs and invariant maps. invariant maps show the variability of properties when a monomer is maintained constant in a position of the biopolymer. mutation cliff maps draw attention to pairs of sequences where a single or limited number of point mutations elicit a large change in a property of interest. we illustrate the program and its applications using a peptide data set collected from the literature.

TI  == developing a microbiological growth inhibition screening assay for the detection  of 27 veterinary drugs from 13 different classes in animal feedingstuffs.
AB  == many regulations prohibit using veterinary drugs in feedingstuffs to protect consumers and animals alike. within this investigation we developed a simple, cost-efficient primary screening method for detecting antibiotics and coccidiostats in animal feeds. thirty-two veterinary drugs were originally considered. following matrix-free testing to optimise detection, an assay based on matrix extraction with methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer followed by inoculation and diffusion in agar plates was developed. final validation was performed with 14 representative drugs (one per drug class) and four bacteria (escherichia coli atcc11303 and atcc27166, staphylococcus aureus atcc6538p, micrococcus luteus atcc9341) in bovine, lamb and swine fodder, measuring growth inhibition zones. of the original drugs tested, 27 remained detectable in feed matrices at or below 20 mg kg(-1). of the 14 validated representatives, two had estimated minimum detectable concentrations of 10-11 mg kg(-1), others of 5 mg kg(-1) or lower, an earlier minimum european union inclusion rate for many veterinary drugs. no significant matrix effect on inhibition zones was detected.  per cent wrong negative deviations ranged from 0% (nine of 14 compounds) to 20-27% (two of 14), while inter-day precision based on inhibition zones had relative standard deviations (rsds) of 6-109% (mean of 40%). when setting a 1 mm  inhibition zone, the maximum observed for negative controls, as a cut-off level,  no false-positives were found. while not all targeted antibiotics were detectable in complex matrices, the majority of veterinary drugs were detected with reasonable sensitivity, indicating that this method could be suitable for screening feedingstuffs prior to further confirmatory investigation of positive findings such as by lc-ms/ms.

TI  == a c-type lectin (aictl-3) from bay scallop argopecten irradians with mannose/galactose binding ability to bind various bacteria.
AB  == c-type lectins are a family of ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins playing crucial roles in innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates. in the present study, the cdna of a c-type lectin with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd) of 127 amino acids was cloned from bay scallop argopecten irradians  (designated aictl-3) by rapid amplification of cdna end (race) techniques based on expressed sequence tag (est) analysis. the mrna transcripts of aictl-3 could be detected in all the tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, adductor muscle, heart, hemocytes, mantle and gill, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. after the challenges with vibrio anguillarum and micrococcus luteus, the mrna expression level of aictl-3 was obviously up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 9h (11.87fold, p<0.01, and 20.02-fold, p<0.05, respectively). the recombinant aictl-3 (designated as raictl-3) could bind lps, pgn, and glucan in vitro, but could not bind mannan. and it also bound gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus as well as gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and v. anguillarum. with a ca(2+) binding site 2 epn (glu-pro-asn) motif, raictl-3 could bind both mannose and galactose which was quite different from those in vertebrate. meanwhile, it could significantly enhance the phagocytosis of scallop hemocytes in vitro. the results clearly suggested that aictl-3 could serve not only as a prr participated in the immune response against various pamps and bacteria in non-self recognition via mannose/galactose binding specificity but an opsonin playing an important part in clearance of invaders.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract for the preservation of large yellow croaker (pseudosciaena crocea).
AB  == background: chemical preservatives have been widely used to keep large yellow croaker fresh. however, the potential harm to human health cannot be ignored. this study was undertaken to investigate the antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract and to evaluate the efficacy of this natural product on the preservation of large yellow croaker. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of bayberry leaf extract against bacteria were 1.0 mg  ml(-)(1) for micrococcus luteus, 0.5 mg ml(-)(1) for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25  mg ml(-)(1) for escherichia coli, 0.5 mg ml(-)(1) for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.0625 mg ml(-)(1) for vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 0.03125 mg ml(-)(1) for listeria monocytogenes, respectively. this result was confirmed by the diameters  of inhibition zone (diz) assay. further studies showed that the bacterial growth  was significantly retarded when large yellow croaker was pretreated with bayberry leaf extract (2 g l(-)(1)) compared to that in the control group. moreover, the generation of total volatile basic nitrogenous compounds (tvb-n), atp degradation products (k-value) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (tbars) were significantly reduced compared to that in the control group. conclusion: our results demonstrated that the shelf life of large yellow croaker can be extended  when supplemented with bayberry leaf extract, which might have implications for natural preservatives.

TI  == functional analysis of domain of unknown function (duf) 1943, duf1944 and von willebrand factor type d domain (vwd) in vitellogenin2 in zebrafish.
AB  == vitellogenin (vg), the precursor of egg-yolk proteins in all oviparous organisms, shares a similar domain structure combination. in most cases, vg contains the vitellogenin_n domain, the domain of unknown function (duf) 1943, and the von willebrand factor type d domain (vwd), which are present in different forms of vg from both vertebrates and invertebrates. occasionally, a duf1944 domain is also present in between duf1943 and vwd in some vg proteins of vertebrates. recent studies have shown that vg participates in immune defense of host with multiple functions. however, whether all vg proteins encoded by different vg genes play an immune role is unknown. in addition, the correlation of different domains in vg with the multiple immune functions remains completely unclear. here we demonstrated clearly that recombinant proteins, rduf1943, rduf1944 and rvwd from  zebrafish vg2 interacted with both the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus and the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and vibrio anguillarum, as well as their signature components lta and lps. moreover, both rduf1943 and rduf1944 promoted the phagocytosis of e. coli and s. aureus by carp macrophages. these suggest that both duf1943 and duf1944 as well as vwd may contribute to the function of vg as a pattern recognition receptor, and duf1943 and duf1944 also contribute to the function of  vg as an opsonin. this study also opens a new angle for identification of function of genes of unknown function, which have the domains duf1943 and duf1944.

TI  == activation of neutrophils by the two-component leukotoxin luke/d from staphylococcus aureus: proteomic analysis of the secretions.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is responsible for severe bacterial infections in hospitals and healthcare facilities. it produces single and bicomponent toxins (leukotoxins and hemolysins) that hinder innate immune function. leukotoxin subunits bind to leukocyte cell membrane thus inducing transmembrane pores and subsequently, cell  lysis. leukotoxin luke/d is a member of the bicomponent toxin family, but to date, no study concerning its involvement in host-pathogen interactions has been  reported. in the present study, we performed the proteomic analysis of the secretions recovered after activation of human neutrophils by leukotoxin luke/d.  the neutrophil secretions were purified by rp-hplc and different fractions were analyzed by edman sequencing, lc-ms/ms, immunoblotted for chromogranin-derived peptides and further analyzed for antimicrobial properties. proteomic analysis revealed that neutrophil secretions constitute a large number of proteins related with immune boosting mechanisms, proteolytic degradation, inflammatory process and antioxidant reactions.

TI  == effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by cuo microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
AB  == this study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (cuomss-ths). microscopic observations of synthesized cuomss-ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. these micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. the cuomss-ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus. the ic50 values of these engineered nps against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and m. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. also, the respiration of gram+ ve organisms (m. luteus and s. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the gram- ve bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. the results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of cuomss-ths with a higher level of toxicity against the gram+ ve vis-a-vis gram- ve bacteria.

TI  == skin-associated bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the nlpc/p60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. to this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16s rrna, tuf and rpob gene sequencing of nine gram-positive isolates identified them as bacillus cereus, b.  licheniformis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis and micrococcus  luteus, known human skin commensals. 16s rrna sequence homologies of four of the  nine isolates identified as b. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. all species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands  detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. in conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. the identification  of a novel cluster of b. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared d. pteronyssinus. it remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 k lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

AB  == bikalga is a hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in burkina faso and neighboring countries. the fermentation is dominated by bacillus subtilis group species. ten b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. the bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the  agar spot assay while only gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. cell free supernatants (cfs) of pure cultures of 3 b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (g2, h4 and f1) strains inhibited growth of listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, while cfs of 2 b. licheniformis (e3 and f9) strains only inhibited m. luteus. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by b. subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 was further characterized. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by h4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. the activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase k and papain. treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase ii resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. the antimicrobial activity of h4 was heat resistant and active at ph3-10. pcr detection of yiwb, sboa, spox, alba  and spas, etns genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kda had antimicrobial activity. ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (uhplc-tofms) analysis of the 4kda band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59da,  which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. the complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. however, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of buchenavia tetraphylla (aubl.) r. a. howard (combretaceae: combretoideae).
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and phytochemical constituents of hydroalcoholic extract and its fractions from buchenavia tetraphylla leaves. cyclohexane (btcf), ethyl acetate (btef), and n-butanol-soluble (btsbf) and non-soluble (btnbf) fractions were obtained from a  liquid-liquid partition of hydroalcoholic extract (bthe) from b. tetraphylla leaves. the hemolytic activity of active fractions was checked. the bthe inhibited the growth of micrococcus luteus (mic: 0.10 mg/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic: 0.20 mg/ml), mycobacterium smegmatis (mic: 0.39 mg/ml), proteus  vulgaris, and staphylococcus aureus (mic: 0.78 mg/ml for both). the more active fractions were btcf and btbsf. btcf showed better potential to inhibit m. luteus  (0.10 mg/ml), p. aeruginosa (0.20 mg/ml), s. enteritidis (0.39 mg/ml), and s. aureus (1.56 mg/ml). btbsf showed the best results for m. luteus (0.10 mg/ml), m. smegmatis, b. subtilis (0.39 mg/ml for both), and p. vulgaris (0.10 mg/ml). the hc50 were greater than observed mic: 20.30, 4.70 and 2.53 mg/ml, respectively, to btbf, bthe and btcf, which. the phytochemical analysis detected the presence of flavanoids, triterpene, carbohydrate, and tannin. our work showed for the first time the broad-spread antimicrobial activity of b. tetraphylla, which has nonhemolytic action, creating a new perspective on the interesting association of traditional and scientific knowledge.

TI  == a four-crd c-type lectin from chlamys farreri mediating nonself-recognition with  broader spectrum and opsonization.
AB  == c-type lectins are a superfamily of ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins consisting of at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (crd), which  participate in nonself-recognition and clearance of invaders. in invertebrate, some multidomain c-type lectins have been identified, but their relative functions and binding mechanism are still meager. in the present study, a c-type  lectin (cflec-4) with four crds from chlamys farreri was selected to investigate  its possible function in innate immunity. the mrna expression of cflec-4 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (p<0.01) after the stimulations of beta-glucan, lps or pgn, and reached the highest expression level at 3, 6, 12 h post-stimulation, which was 27.9-, 22.6- or 47.9-fold of that in blank group, respectively. immunohistochemistry assay with polyclonal antibody specific for cflec-4 revealed that the endogenous cflec-4 was mainly located in the hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops. the recombinant cflec-4 (rcflec-4) could bind lps, pgn, glucan and mannose in vitro, but could not bind lta. furthermore, rcflec-4 displayed a broader bacteria binding spectrum towards  gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus as well as gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, vibrio anguillarum and fungi pichia pastoris. meanwhile, rcflec-4 could significantly (p<0.01) enhance the phagocytosis of hemocytes in vitro. the results clearly suggested that four-crd containing cflec-4 not only served as prr with wider recognition spectrum, but also functioned as an opsonin participating in the clearance of invaders in scallops. it could be inferred that the diversity and complexity of crds in c-type lectins endowed these receptors with comprehensive recognition spectrum and multiple immune functions against complex living environment.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial and time-kill evaluation of the erythrina caffra thunb. extract against bacteria associated with diarrhoea.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of stem bark ethanolic extract of erythrina caffra thunb. against bacteria in diarrhoea was determined in vitro by the agar diffusion and dilution, macrobroth dilution, and time-kill assay methods. the result showed that the extract produced inhibition zones ranging between 15 +/- 1.0 mm and 23 +/- 1.0 mm, and the bacteria were susceptible at concentrations ranging between </=100 and </=1000 mug/ml. while the mics of the extract ranged between 39.1 and 625 mug/ml, and the mbcs ranged between 78.1 and 625 mug/ml, the mics of micrococcus luteus, proteus vulgaris csir 0030, enterococcus faecalis kzn, and staphylococcus aureus ok(3) were less than 100 mug/ml, and the mechanisms of antibiosis indicated that the crude ethanolic extract was highly bactericidal against the entire test bacteria isolates. in the time-kill assay, the average log reduction of the viable cell count ranged between 0.916 log(1)(0) and 1.851 log(1)(0) cfu/ml on incubating the bacteria for 4 h at the mics, while  the reduction ranged between 0.183 log(1)(0) and 1.105 log(1)(0) cfu/ml after 8 h of incubation. incubating the bacteria for 4 h at 2 x mics resulted in the reduction of the viable cell count to between -0.264 log(1)(0) and 0.961 log(1)(0) cfu/ml, while the average log reduction ranged between -3.968 log(1)(0) and -0.425 log(1)(0) cfu/ml after 8 h of incubation with micrococcus luteus, proteus vulgaris csir 0030, and staphylococcus aureus ok(3) being the most highly affected bacteria. the result showed that the extract exhibited broader-spectrum  antibacterial activity and justifies the use of erythrina caffra in the folkloric medicine for treating gastrointestinal infections in south africa.

TI  == nurses' uniforms: how many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  == this pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. to achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in washington state at the beginning of their shift. worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. the results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. after 48 h, mrsa  positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. additional bacteria identified include: bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus roseus. the significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == comparison of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test with the tube coagulase test performed on positive blood cultures for evaluation and application in a clinical routine setting.
AB  == many studies demonstrate that delayed proper therapy in bloodstream infections caused by staphylococcus aureus increases the mortality rate, emphasizing the need to shorten the turnaround time for positive blood cultures. different techniques are currently available, from phenotypic methods to more complex tests such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof), real-time pcr (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (pna fish). this study evaluated  the performance of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test (qft), a novel fish methodology, compared with the direct tube coagulase test (dtct) on blood cultures exhibiting gram-positive cocci in clusters. a total of 173 blood cultures collected from 128 different patients were analyzed using the dtct, evaluated after both 4 and 24 h, and the qft. a total of 179 isolates were identified using the vitek2 system. thirty-five out of 35 staphylococcus aureus were correctly identified by the qft (sensitivity = 100%), with a specificity of  100% (no green fluorescence was detected for strains different from s. aureus). the dtct was positive after 4 h for 28 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 80%)  and after 24 h for 31 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 88.57%). among the remaining 144 isolates, one was then identified as corynebacterium striatum and two as micrococcus luteus. qft identified 139 out of the 141 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (sensitivity = 98.58%), showing again a specificity of 100%  (no fluorescent red signals were detected for strains different from cons). we also discuss also the implementation process of this methodology in our setting,  with particular emphasis on the workflow and the cost-effectiveness.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

AB  == crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (wap) domain in the c-terminal end. different from the reported ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cdna library of portunus trituberculatus in this study. all ptcrustins share the consensus cysteine motif  and are considered as type i crustins. four exons and three introns are identified in genomic dna sequence of ptcrustin3 while three exons and two introns in ptcrustin2. the mrna transcripts of ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. although both ptcrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, ptcrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than ptcrustin2. unlike most crustins, both recombinant ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus and gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, rptcrustin2 is moderately active against yeast pichia pastoris and rptcrustin3 show significant activity against gram-negative bacterium vibrio alginolyticus. these results indicate that ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are two novel crustins and  play different roles in immune response of p. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == impedimetric biosensor based on cell-mediated bioimprinted films for bacterial detection.
AB  == this work presents the synthesis of bacteria-mediated bioimprinted films for selective bacterial detection. marine pathogen sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were chosen as the template bacteria. chitosan (cs) doped with reduced graphene sheets (rgss) was electrodeposited on an indium tin oxide electrode, and the resulting rgss-cs hybrid film served as a platform for bacterial attachment. the  electrodeposition conditions were optimized to obtain rgss-cs hybrid films with excellent electrochemical performance. a layer of nonconductive cs film was deposited to embed the pathogen, and acetone was used to wash away the bacterial  templates. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to characterize the stepwise modification process and monitor the srb population. faradic impedance measurements revealed that the charge transfer resistance (r(ct)) increased with increased srb concentration. a linear relationship between deltar(ct) and the logarithm of srb concentration was obtained within the concentration range of 1.0x10(4)cfum l(-1) to 1.0x10(8)cfum l(-1). the impedimetric sensor showed good selectivity towards srb based on size and shape.  hence, selectivity for bacterial detection can be improved if the bioimprinting technique is combined with other bio-recognition elements.

TI  == antibacterial activities of polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate coated silver nanoparticles in normal and multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles coated with different functionalizing agents i.e., polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate were evaluated on both normal and multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. under the same reaction conditions, these functionalizing agents were added separately to coat silver nanoparticles. among these, polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles were most effective in killing all the bacterial strains which includes escherichia coli dh5a, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of shigella spp. (flexneri, boydii, sohnea) and vibrio cholerae. the minimum inhibitory concentration of polyethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles was also less compared to the other two sets of nanoparticles. consistence with that polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles produced more intracellular reactive oxygen species in bacteria. moreover, when human cell lines mcf7 and chang liver  were incubated in presence of these nanoparticles for 18 h with same concentrations as used for bacteria, no toxicity was observed. but significant increase in cell killing was observed with longer incubation time. thus our present investigation implicates the potential therapeutic use of silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agent particularly the polyethylene glycol coated  one.

TI  == identification of a new bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. the purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. a new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica ser. pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as b116. this new isolate was identified as bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. the production  of bacteriocin-like substance (bls) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. the bls was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kda by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, and salmonella spp. the bls was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. activity of the bls was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. the new isolate and relevant bls are potentially useful in food and feed applications.

AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers. (bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). aim of the study: to investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. materials and methods: methanolic extracts of pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in wistar rats. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. in vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. results: the results indicated that pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the  organisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and candida tropicana. during early wound healing phase tnf-alpha and il-6 level were found to be up regulated by pyrostegia venusta treatment. conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength,  augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by  pyrostegia venusta flower extract. induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by pyrostegia venusta extract. results suggest that pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.

TI  == in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm  formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring  at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

TI  == peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (pglyrp3) has an anti-inflammatory role in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to bacterial peptidoglycan (pgn), which is detected by several classes of pattern-recognition  receptors (prrs) as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pglyrps), toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and nod receptors. all types of pglyrps recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and function in antibacterial innate immunity. in this study, we investigated the role of pglyrp3 in the response of intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2) to pgn from pathogenic (staphylococcus aureus), opportunistic pathogenic (micrococcus luteus) and non-pathogenic (bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) bacteria found in the gut as commensals or in gastroenteritis. all  pgns induced the proinflammatory cytokines il-12p35, il-8 and tnf-alpha and, time-dependently, pglyrp3, at both the transcription and protein levels. in this  context, no differences were observed among the distinct pgn obtained from different bacterial sources. the inflammatory response to pgn is mediated via the tlr2 pathway, since blocking this pathway by inhibiting myd88 reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. in addition, pglyrp3 overexpression suppressed, while pglyrp3 knocking down enhanced the expression of pgn-induced inflammatory cytokines. it is concluded that pgn stimulates inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelia through activation of the tlr pathway. pglyrp3 is also stimulated by pgn and has, in contrast to activation of the tlr pathway, an anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  == ctriporin, a new anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus peptide from the venom of the scorpion chaerilus tricostatus.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant microbes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, seriously threaten human health. the outbreak of "superbugs" in recent years emphasizes once again the need for the development of new antimicrobial agents or resources. antimicrobial peptides have an evident bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant pathogens. in the present study, a new antimicrobial  peptide, ctriporin, was cloned and characterized from the venom of the scorpion chaerilus tricostatus, an animal which has not yet been explored for toxic peptide resources. the mics of ctriporin against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus  thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and candida albicans are 5  to 20 mug/ml. meanwhile, it mic against clinical antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is 10 mug/ml. furthermore, the potential for ctriporin to be used as a topical antibiotic for treating staphylococcal skin infections was investigated.  external use of the peptide ctriporin dramatically decreased the bacterial counts and cured skin infections in mice. in addition, ctriporin demonstrates antimicrobial efficacy via the bactericidal mechanism of rapid cell lysis. together, these results suggest the potential of developing ctriporin as a new topical antibiotic.

TI  == bacterial infection of mudfish clarias gariepinus (siluriformes: clariidae) fingerlings in tropical nursery ponds.
AB  == bacterial infection among the most common cultured mudfish clarias gariepinus in  africa, has become a cause of concern, because it constitutes the largest economic loss in fish farms. in order to provide useful biological data of the pathogens for good management practices, samples were collected monthly between january 2008 and december 2009 in three monoculture nursery ponds, located in three different positions: upriver (a, grassland), mid-river (b, mixed forest and grassland) and downriver (c, rainforest) along 200 km length of cross river floodplains, nigeria. a total of 720 fingerlings between 15.1 and 20.7 g were analyzed to determine the degree of infection. the bacterial pathogens were taken from their external surfaces, and were isolated and identified by standard methods. the caudal fins of fingerlings from pond a had the highest bacterial load (5.8 x 10(3) cfu/g), while the least counts (1.2 x 103 cfu/g) were identified on the head of fish from pond c, with flexibacter columnaris as the major etiological agent. pseudomonas fluorescens, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus were identified as co-isolates with p. fluorescens as dominant (0.7 x 10(2) cfu/ml) co-isolates in pond water. clinical signs of five white spots with red periphery appeared on the external surface of infected fish. all the fish sampled, died after 4 to 9 days.  there was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between different ponds, but the difference between fish organs/parts examined was significant. fish from these ponds are therefore potentially dangerous to consumers and highly devalued, with the economic impact to producers. preventive methods to avoid these infections are recommended.

TI  == relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == background: two nf-kappab signaling pathways, toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in drosophila. in response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are  important components of a humoral defense response. however, it is less clear to  what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. methodology/principal findings: in order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies  wildtype or mutant for various toll and imd pathway components. we found that in  all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant toll or imd pathway activation. our data failed to confirm a role of the pgrp-sa and gnbp1 pattern recognition receptors for phagocytosis of s. aureus. the drosophila scavenger receptor eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or s2 cells of e. faecalis and s. aureus, but not of m. luteus. in the case of m. luteus and e. faecalis, but not s. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. conclusions/significance: our  results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.

AB  == detection of pathogenic invaders is the essential first step of a successful defense response in multicellular organisms. in this study, we have identified a  new member of the beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein superfamily from the tobacco hornworm manduca sexta. this protein, designated microbe binding protein (mbp), is 61% identical in sequence to bombyx mori gram-negative bacteria binding protein, but only 34-36% identical to m. sexta beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-1 and 2. its mrna levels were strongly up-regulated in hemocytes and fat  body of immune challenged larvae, along with an increase in concentration of the  plasma protein. we expressed m. sexta mbp in a baculovirus-insect cell system. the purified protein associated with intact bacteria and fungi. it specifically bound to lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide, diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycans (dap-pgs) from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, but less so to laminarin or lys-type pg from staphylococcus aureus. the complex binding pattern was influenced by other plasma factors and additional microbial surface molecules. after different amounts of mbp had been incubated with larval plasma on ice, a concentration-dependent increase in phenoloxidase (po) activity occurred in the absence of any microbial elicitor. the activity increase was also observed in the mixture of plasma and a bacterial or fungal cell wall component.  the prophenoloxidase (propo) activation became more prominent when dap-pgs, micrococcus luteus lys-pg, or lipoteichoic acid was included in the mixture of mbp and plasma. statistic analysis suggested that a synergistic enhancement of propo activation was caused by an interaction between mbp and these elicitors, but not s. aureus lys-pg, lipopolysaccharide, curdlan, or laminarin. these data indicate that m. sexta mbp is a component of the surveillance mechanism and, by working together with other pattern recognition molecules and serine proteinases, triggers the propo activation system.

TI  == gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (epilobium angustifolium).
AB  == the emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade  represent a growing public health concern globally. with the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. willow herb (epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. the authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. the authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of micrococcus luteus (p < .01), staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), escherichia coli (p < .001), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). they also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). these results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.

AB  == the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus  streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus  niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.

TI  == effect of flash-heat treatment on antimicrobial activity of breastmilk.
AB  == background and objectives: the world health organization recommends human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive mothers in resource-poor regions heat-treat expressed breastmilk during periods of increased maternal-to-child transmission risk. flash-heat, a "low tech" pasteurization method, inactivates hiv, but effects on milk protein bioactivity are unknown. the objectives were to measure flash-heat's effect on antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and whole milk and on the digestive resistance of lactoferrin and lysozyme. methods:  flash-heated and unheated breastmilk aliquots from hiv-positive mothers in south  africa were "spiked" with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and then cultured for 0, 3, and 6 hours. lysozyme and lactoferrin activities were determined by lysis of micrococcus luteus cells and inhibition of enteropathogenic e. coli, respectively, measured spectrophotometrically. percentages of proteins surviving in vitro digestion, lactoferrin and lysozyme activity, and bacteriostatic activity of whole milk in heated versus unheated samples were compared. results: there was no difference in rate of growth of e. coli or s. aureus in flash-heated versus unheated whole milk (p = 0.61 and p = 0.96, respectively). mean (95% confidence interval) antibacterial activity of lactoferrin was diminished 11.1% (7.8%, 14.3%) and that of lysozyme by up to 56.6% (47.1%, 64.5%) by flash-heat. digestion of lysozyme was unaffected (p = 0.12), but 25.4% less lactoferrin survived digestion (p < 0.0001). conclusions: in summary, flash-heat resulted in minimally decreased lactoferrin and moderately decreased lysozyme bioactivity, but bacteriostatic activity of whole milk against representative bacteria was unaffected. this suggests flash-heated breastmilk likely has a similar profile of resistance to bacterial contamination as that of  unheated milk. clinical significance of the decreased bioactivity should be tested in clinical trials.

TI  == biological and docking studies of topoisomerase iv inhibition by thiosemicarbazides.
AB  == 4-benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type iia topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=90 mum) but not against dna gyrase. an increase  in activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=14 mum) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). however, (2) showed only  weak antibacterial activity. although the results of the bacterial type iia topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase iv. the difference in activity against type iia topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the atp binding pocket.

TI  == bacterial tolerance to silver nanoparticles (snps): aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage environment.
AB  == use of silver nanoparticles (snps) is increasing in a large number of consumer products. thus, the possible build-up of the nanoparticles in the environment is  becoming a major concern. aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage showed tolerance to 200 mug/ml snps. the growth kinetics data for a. punctata treated with nanoparticles were similar to those in the absence of nanoparticles. there was a reduction in the amount of exopolysaccharides (eps) in bacterial culture supernatant after nanoparticle-supernatant interaction. eps capping of the nanoparticles was confirmed by uv-visible, xrd and comparative ftir analysis. the eps-capped snps showed less toxicity to escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus compared to the uncapped ones. the study suggests capping  of nanoparticles by bacterially produced eps as a probable physiological defense  mechanism.

TI  == involvement of manduca sexta peptidoglycan recognition protein-1 in the recognition of bacteria and activation of prophenoloxidase system.
AB  == although the importance of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) in detecting bacteria and promoting immunity is well recognized in drosophila melanogaster and other insect species, such a role has not yet been experimentally established for pgrps in the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. in this study, we purified m. sexta pgrp1 from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, tested its association with peptidoglycans and intact bacteria, and explored its possible link with the prophenoloxidase activation system in larval hemolymph. sequence comparison suggested that pgrp1 is not an amidase and lacks residues for interacting with the carboxyl group of meso-diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycans (dap-pgs). m. sexta pgrp1 gene was constitutively expressed at a low level in fat body, and the mrna concentration became much higher after an injection of escherichia coli. consistently, the protein concentration in larval plasma increased in a time-dependent manner after the immune challenge. purified recombinant pgrp1 specifically bound to soluble dap-pg of e. coli but not to soluble lys-type pg of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, this recognition protein completely bound to insoluble pgs from micrococcus luteus, bacillus megaterium and bacillus subtilis, whereas its association with the bacterial cells was low even though their peptidoglycans are exposed on the cell surface. after pgrp1 had been added to plasma of naive larvae in the absence of microbial elicitor, there was a concentration-dependent increase in prophenoloxidase activation. phenoloxidase activity, as usual, increased after the plasma was incubated with peptidoglycans or bacterial cells.  these increases became more prominent when insoluble m. luteus or b. megaterium pg or soluble e. coli pg and pgrp1 were both present. statistic analysis suggested a synergistic effect caused by interaction between pgrp1 and these pgs. taken together, these results indicated that pgrp1 is a member of the m. sexta prophenoloxidase activation system, which recognizes peptidoglycans from certain  bacteria and initiates the host defense response. the unexplained difference between the purified pgs and intact bacteria clearly reflects our general lack of understanding of pgrp1-mediated recognition and how it leads to propo activation.

TI  == spectrum of activity, mutation rates, synergistic interactions, and the effects of ph and serum proteins for fusidic acid (cem-102).
AB  == fusidic acid (cem-102) is a steroidal antimicrobial agent with focused gram-positive activity that acts by preventing bacterial protein synthesis via interacting with elongation factor g. a collection of 114 wild-type isolates (> 80 species) was used to define the contemporary limits of fusidic acid spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative species. reference broth microdilution and anaerobic agar dilution methods were performed. modifications of standardized test methods included adding 10% human serum and adjusting the medium ph to 5, 6, and 8. synergy was assessed by the checkerboard method and time-kill studies. mutational rates to resistance were determined at 4 x, 8 x, and 16 x mic. against gram-positive pathogens, fusidic acid mic values ranged from 0.06 to 32 microg/ml with the greatest potency against staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium spp., and micrococcus luteus (mic results, 0.25, < or = 0.12, and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). enterococci and streptococci were less susceptible (mic ranges, 2-8 and 16-32 microg/ml, respectively). fusidic acid activity against gram-negative species was more limited (all mic values, > or = 2 microg/ml) except for empedobacter brevis, moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria meningitidis. a 4-fold increase in fusidic acid mic results was observed when 10% serum was added to the broth. decreasing medium ph to 5.0 to 6.0 negated the protein binding effects. among the 8 antimicrobial combinations tested, gentamicin and rifampin enhanced the activity when combined with fusidic acid (no antagonism). fusidic acid in vitro activity was most improved when combined with rifampin. single-step mutational rates ranged from 1.2 x 10(-6) for 4x mic to 9.8 x 10(-8)  for 16 x mic. in conclusion, these in vitro results for fusidic acid tested against contemporary strains confirm a persisting antimicrobial spectrum, especially against staphylococci and some other gram-positive species.

TI  == aictl-6, a novel c-type lectin from bay scallop argopecten irradians with a long  c-type lectin-like domain.
AB  == c-type lectins are a superfamily of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play  crucial roles in the innate immunity. in this study, a novel c-type lectin gene from scallop argopecten irradians (designated as aictl-6) was cloned by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) approach based on expression sequence tag (est) analysis. the full-length cdna of aictl-6 was 1080 bp. the open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 307 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a c-type lectin-like domain (ctld) of 150 amino acid residues longer than any usual ctld. it contained six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three internal disulfide bridges and an epd (glu(269)-pro(270)-asp(271)) motif at the ca(2+)-binding site 2. the deduced amino acid sequence of aictl-6 showed high similarity to members of c-type lectin superfamily. by fluorescent quantitative real-time pcr, aictl-6 mrna was found mainly in hepatopancreas and gill, and marginally expressed in other tissues. after the scallops were challenged by listonella anguillarum for 6 h, the mrna expression of aictl-6 was up-regulated significantly to 7.2-fold compared to the blank group. while at 9 h post micrococcus luteus challenge, its expression level was 60.1 times higher than that of the blank group. the functional activity of aictl-6 was investigated by recombination and expression of the cdna fragment encoding its mature peptide in  escherichia coli rosetta gami (de3). the recombinant aictl-6 could agglutinate gram-negative bacteria e. coli top10f', gram-positive bacteria m. luteus and staphylococcus aureus. these results collectively suggested that aictl-6, as a novel member of c-type lectin family, contributed to the host defense mechanisms  against invading microorganism in a. irradians.

AB  == background: skin prick tests are commonly used for human allergy testing and determination. because solutions are kept at 4 degrees c and patient's skin is cleaned, the same solutions are used on many patients with the same applicators without sterilization. objectives: our objectives were to determine whether a model bacteria could survive in antigen solutions and whether bacteria from patient's skin could be found in clinical antigen solutions. methods: unused antigen solutions were spiked using staphylococcus epidermidis. concentration was followed from time = 0 to time = 21 days. clinical samples consisted of antigen solutions used on a daily basis, from different hospital centers (n = 146). these were tested for total bacterial counts and detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. isolates were  identified by 16s rdna sequencing. results: the concentration of s epidermidis remained stable over the 21 days. twenty-three percent of the clinical antigen solutions contained bacteria. as expected, species like s aureus, s hominis, s epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus were highly represented (62.5%) within a total of 20 different species. conclusion: skin bacteria can survive in antigen solutions used in skin prick tests. moreover, even if no mrsa were observed in field samples, nosocomial infections could be a concern if pathogens were present on the skin of some tested patients.

TI  == antibacterial effect of apatite-coated titanium dioxide for textiles applications.
AB  == an antibacterial activity of apatite-coated titanium dioxide (tio2) against four  types of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and micrococcus luteus) was investigated. its antibacterial performance was observed under black light, visible light, and dark conditions. the number of viable bacteria decreased with irradiation time and became most prominent at 24 hours. distortion of bacterial cells by the nanoparticles was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. apatite-coated tio2 was fixed on cotton textiles by dip-coat technique, and the antimicrobial properties of corresponding fabrics were then investigated. the effect of irradiation source on antimicrobial activity of coated cotton fabrics was examined, wherein black-light irradiation demonstrated higher antibacterial activity than either visible-light irradiation or dark conditions. microbial populations of coated cotton fabrics decreased with increasing irradiation intensity. coated cotton fabrics have been shown to be nontoxic to human dermal fibroblasts. our findings suggest that the presence of apatite-coated tio2 shows  antibacterial activity in the presence of black light or visible light, suggesting its potential use in reducing the risk of microorganism transmission for textile applications.

TI  == transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. methods: the sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean  age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). all subjects underwent rapid maxillary  expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. two 10-ml blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. all blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and api kits (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). results: overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. the data were analyzed with the fisher exact test. no statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (p = 0.054). conclusions: because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.

TI  == binding and cellular activation studies reveal that toll-like receptor 2 can differentially recognize peptidoglycan from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than  direct binding to monitor recognition. we have employed surface plasmon resonance (spr) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from gram-positive (lysine-containing) and gram-negative (diaminopimelic  acid (dap)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (pgn). in the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from pgn remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. however, a wider range of dap-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled pgn. the difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of pgn. it was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and dap can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. cellular activation studies employing highly purified pgn from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. the data firmly establish toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for pgn and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == an investigation of bioactive phytochemicals in the leaves of melicope vitiflora  by electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometry.
AB  == the ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of melicope vitiflora was separated by column chromatography and the resulting fractions tested for their bioactivity towards methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and micrococcus luteus (ml). the bioactive column chromatography fractions were further separated by preparative tlc and dereplication was carried out on them by first subjecting them to electrospray ionisation-ion trap mass spectrometry (esi-ms(n)). the resulting molecular masses, their fragmentation patterns in addition to the chemnet database (www.chemnetbase.com) were used to aid in the structural elucidation of some of the compounds by permitting comparison with known structures of natural origin. some molecular masses and the corresponding fragmentations were found that did not correlate with any known compounds thus revealing potentially novel natural products that could be investigated on a larger scale and could ultimately find application as new drugs against mrsa and  other multi drug resistant microorganisms. structures are also proposed for known compounds that have not been previously reported for m. vitiflora.

TI  == the triacylated atp binding cluster transporter substrate-binding lipoprotein of  staphylococcus aureus functions as a native ligand for toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == some synthetic lipopeptides, in addition to native lipoproteins derived from both gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, are known to activate tlr2 (toll-like receptor 2). however, the native lipoproteins inherent to gram-positive bacteria, which function as tlr2 ligands, have not been characterized. here, we have purified a native lipoprotein to homogeneity from staphylococcus aureus to study  as a native tlr2 ligand. the purified 33-kda lipoprotein was capable of stimulating tlr2 and was identified as a triacylated sitc lipoprotein, which belongs to a family of atp binding cluster (abc) transporter substrate-binding proteins. analyses of the sitc-mediated production of cytokine using mouse peritoneal macrophages revealed that the sitc protein (3 nm) induced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. moreover, analysis of knock-out mice showed that sitc required tlr2 and myd88, but not tlr1 or tlr6, for the induction of cytokines. in addition to the s. aureus sitc lipoprotein, we purified two other native abc transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins from bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus, which were both shown to stimulate tlr2. these results demonstrate that s. aureus sitc lipoprotein is triacylated and that the abc transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins of gram-positive bacteria function as native ligands for tlr2.

TI  == oxidation of lanthionines renders the lantibiotic nisin inactive.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic nisin a belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. they are classified as lantibiotics because they contain the structural group lanthionine. lanthionines are composed of a single sulfur atom that is linked to the beta-carbons of two alanine moieties. these sulfur atoms are vulnerable to environmental oxidation. a mild oxidation reaction was performed on nisin a to determine the relative effects it would have on bioactivity. high-mass-accuracy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data revealed the addition of seven, eight, and nine oxygens. these  additions correspond to the five lanthionines, two methionines, and two histidines that would be susceptible to oxidation. subsequent bioassays revealed  that the oxidized form of nisin a had a complete loss of bactericidal activity. in a competition study, the oxidized nisin did not appear to have an antagonistic affect on the bioactivity of nisin a, since the addition of an equal molar concentration of the oxidized variant did not have an influence on the bactericidal activity of the native antibiotic. electron microscopy data revealed that the oxidized forms were still capable of assembling into large circular complexes, demonstrating that oxidation does not disrupt the lateral assembly mechanism of the antibiotic. affinity thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence  microscopy experiments suggested that the loss of activity is due to the inability of the oxidized form of nisin to bind to the cell wall precursor lipid  ii. given the loss of bioactivity following oxidation, oxidation should be an important factor to consider in future production, purification, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == pitfalls in efficacy testing--how important is the validation of neutralization of chlorhexidine digluconate?
AB  == background: effective neutralization of active agents is essential to obtain valid efficacy results, especially when non-volatile active agents like chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) are tested. the aim of this study was to determine an effective and non-toxic neutralizing mixture for a propan-1-ol solution containing 2% chg. methods: experiments were carried out according to astm e 1054-02. the neutralization capacity was tested separately with five challenge microorganisms in suspension, and with a rayon swab carrier. either 0.5 ml of the antiseptic solution (suspension test) or a saturated swab with the antiseptic solution (carrier test) was added to tryptic soy broth containing neutralizing agents. after the samples were mixed, aliquots were spread immediately and after 3 h of storage at 2 - 8 degrees c onto tryptic soy agar containing a neutralizing mixture. results: the neutralizer was, however, not consistently effective in the suspension test. immediate spread yielded a valid neutralization with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium jeikeium but not with micrococcus luteus (p < 0.001) and candida  albicans (p < 0.001). a 3-h storage period of the neutralized active agents in suspension resulted in significant carry-over activity of chg in addition against staphylococcus epidermidis (p < 0.001) and corynebacterium jeikeium (p = 0.044).  in the carrier test, the neutralizing mixture was found to be effective and non toxic to all challenge microorganisms when spread immediately. however, after 3 h storage of the neutralized active agents significant carry-over activity of chg against micrococcus luteus (p = 0.004; tukey hsd) was observed. conclusion: without effective neutralization in the sampling fluid, non-volatile active ingredients will continue to reduce the number of surviving microorganisms after  antiseptic treatment even if the sampling fluid is kept cold straight after testing. this can result in false-positive antiseptic efficacy data. attention should be paid during the neutralization validation process to the amount of antiseptic solution, the storage time and to the choice of appropriate and sensitive microorganisms.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == ceragenins: cholic acid-based mimics of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria drives the quest for new antimicrobials, including those that are not expected to readily engender resistance. one option is to mimic nature's most ubiquitous means of controlling  bacterial growth, antimicrobial peptides, which have evolved over eons. in general, bacteria remain susceptible to these peptides. human antimicrobial peptides play a central role in innate immunity, and deficiencies in these peptides have been tied to increased rates of infection. however, clinical use of antimicrobial peptides is hampered by issues of cost and stability. the development of nonpeptide mimics of antimicrobial peptides may provide the best of both worlds: a means of using the same mechanism chosen by nature to control bacterial growth without the problems associated with peptide therapeutics. the ceragenins were developed to mimic the cationic, facially amphiphilic structures  of most antimicrobial peptides. these compounds reproduce the required morphology using a bile-acid scaffolding and appended amine groups. the resulting compounds  are actively bactericidal against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. this antimicrobial activity originates from selective association of the ceragenins with negatively charged bacterial membrane components. association has been studied with synthetic models of bacterial membrane components, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, with vesicles derived from bacterial phospholipids, and with whole cells. comparisons of the antimicrobial activities of ceragenins and representative antimicrobial peptides  suggest that these classes of compounds share a mechanism of action. rapid membrane depolarization is caused by both classes as well as blebbing of bacterial membranes. bacteria express the same genes in response to both classes  of compounds. on the basis of the antibacterial activities of ceragenins and preliminary in vivo studies, we expect these compounds to find use in augmenting  or replacing antimicrobial peptides in treating human disease.

TI  == antimicrobial protein from streptomyces fulvissimus inhibitory to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == fermented culture of streptomyces fulvissimus was found to secrete an antibacterial protein inhibitory to micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains. the extracellular protein from the fermented culture on concentration revealed a  high molecular weight peptide of 63kda on sds-page gel and the region on gel displayed inhibitory activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. bioactivity of the extra cellular protein was non-sensitive to proteinase k, alpha chymotrypsin, protease, edta (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid), pmsf  (phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) and dmso (dimethyl sulfoxide) but partially susceptible to amylase and heat. glycoprotein nature of the proteinaceous compound was confirmed by periodic acid schiffs (pas) staining. the secretary protein of s. fulvissimus demonstrated a significant activity against mrsa strain. it could be an important source for developing new drugs to control multidrug resistant gram positive bacteria.

TI  == [study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus kaistia, strains nf1  and nf3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  == transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (umb) strains nf1 and nf3,  affiliated with the genus kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. strains nf1 and nf3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive bacillus subtilis and gram-negative acidovorax delafildii. umb cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. the selectivity of parasitism of the studied umb to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects,  b. subtilis atcc 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium a. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to umb attack. other bacteria (micrococcus luteus vkm  ac-2230, staphylococcus aureus 209-p, pseudomonas putida bs394, escherichia coli  c 600, and pantoea agglomerans atcc 27155) were not attacked by umb. it was established for the first time that free-living umb may be facultative parasites  not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. the umb under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dextran-conjugated lysozyme against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in cheese curd.
AB  == the purposes of this research were to glycosylate lysozyme with dextran under maillard reaction conditions and assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the  lysozyme-dextran conjugate in a culture medium and cheese curd. solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees c and at 79% relative humidity. gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation  process. under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. the lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against e. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. unlike e. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against s. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo  tests. antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate. these results might increase the applicability of lysozyme as a natural antimicrobial ingredient in different food products.

TI  == characterization of antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  == five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. twenty-two antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at terra nova bay (ross sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. none of the isolates inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus candida albicans. active antarctic isolates, identified by 16s  rdna sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-proteobacteria (6 strains). inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of antarctic marine  bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

TI  == a combined mass spectrometric and cdna sequencing approach to the isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea.
AB  == studies conducted on amphibian skin secretions over the past 40 years have isolated and identified huge arrays of bioactive peptides, many of which have demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity. such peptides are attracting increasing attention due to the growing problem of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics. the current study utilized a combined proteomic/genomic approach to facilitate the high throughput sequencing of five novel dermaseptins and four novel phylloseptins from the skin secretions of phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea. peptides were partially identified using q-tof ms/ms fragmentation and de novo sequencing, while a cdna library was constructed from the lyophilized skin secretion. 3'-race reactions used primers designed for the highly conserved 5'-signal regions of previously deduced dermaseptin precursors. cdna sequenced peptides were attributed to their respective fragmentation spectra to confirm the structure of the final processed  peptides. such an approach identified post-translational modifications in addition to deciphering isobaric amino acids. several of the peptides were purified to homogeneity and displayed potent antimicrobial activity with minimum  inhibitory concentrations starting at 0.4 microm when tested against and range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus.

AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == in vitro deposition of lysozyme on etafilcon a and balafilcon a hydrogel contact  lenses: effects on adhesion and survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == purpose: to compare lysozyme adsorption and absorption and bacterial adhesion interactions on conventional (etafilcon a) and silicone (balafilcon a) hydrogel contact lenses. method: lysozyme concentrations and activities associated with the lenses were determined after solvent extraction (trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) and directly on the lenses without extraction with micrococcal- and micro-bicinchoninic acid (bca) assays. cells of bacteria with radiolabeled leucine and a cell recovery procedure were used in determinations of bacterial adhesion to lenses. results: lysozyme was adsorbed and absorbed to the  conventional etafilcon a lens at about a 10-fold greater concentration than to the balafilcon a silicone hydrogel lens. enzyme activities on the surfaces of both lenses were similar but replenished after saline extraction only with the etafilcon a lens. lysozyme on the lens surface showed significant lysis of micrococcus luteus but had a negligible effect on the adhesion and survival of staphylococcus aureus. lysozyme did not appear to affect the survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa on lenses. conclusion: in vitro experiments show that concentrations of active lysozyme on the surface of the etafilcon a lens, unlike  the balafilcon a lens which showed negligible absorption, may be sustained from the lens matrix. lysozyme deposited on hydrogel lenses had marked activity against m. luteus but relatively minor effects on the primary adhesion of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == peptidoglycan recognition by the drosophila imd pathway.
AB  == the structural requirements for recognition of peptidoglycan (pgn) by pgrp-lc and activation of the drosophila imd pathway are not yet clear. in order to examine this question more carefully, the activity of peptidoglycan from different types  of bacteria was compared in cell-based and whole animal assays. drosophila s2* cells, but not adult flies, responded to lys-type micrococcus luteus pgn, but with significantly less potency compared to dap-type escherichia coli pgn, while  intact lys-type pgn from staphylococcus aureus was inactive. after treatment with lysostaphin, which digests the cross-bridging peptides, s. aureus pgn weakly stimulated the imd pathway, similar to m. luteus pgn. further digestion with mutanolysin, which creates monomeric pgn fragments, abolished the activity of s.  aureus pgn. on the other hand, monomeric e. coli pgn, generated by mutanolysin digestion, was still active but required different isoforms of pgrp-lc for recognition. polymeric pgn required only pgrp-lcx, while monomeric e. coli pgn required both the pgrp-lca and pgrp-lcx isoforms. these results suggest that the  recognition by pgrp-lcx alone requires polymeric pgn, and that polymeric dap-type pgn is a more potent pgrp-lcx agonist, compared to lys-type pgn. these results also suggest that the heteromeric pgrp-lca/lcx receptor complex recognizes monomeric dap-type, but not lys-type, pgn.

AB  == cecropin p1 was first identified as a mammalian antimicrobial peptide isolated from the pig intestine. much research aimed at characterizing this peptide has been reported. recently, the workers who discovered the peptide corrected their original conclusion, and confirmed that this peptide originates in fact from the  pig intestinal parasitic nematode, ascaris suum. in the present study, we carried out a semi-exhaustive search for bacteria-inducible transcripts in a. suum by the cdna subtraction method. the transcripts encoding cecropin p1 and novel ascaris cecropins, designated cecropins p2, p3 and p4, were found to be positively induced factors. chemically synthesized ascaris cecropins were bactericidal against a wide range of microbes, i.e. gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and esherichia coli) bacteria, and were weakly but detectably active against yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans). cecropin p1-like sequences were also detected at least in two other species (ascaris lumbricoides and toxocara canis) of the ascarididae. all ascaris cecropin precursors contain an acidic pro-region connected by a tetra-basic cleavage site at the c-terminus. such an acidic pro-region is also reported to be present in the tunicate cecropin-type antimicrobial peptide styelin. on the basis of the evolutionary position of nematodes and tunicates, the ancestral cecropin may have contained the acidic pro-region at the c-terminus.

TI  == isolation and characterization of microorganisms from instruments used by pedicurists operating within lagos metropolis, nigeria.
AB  == eight bacterial and five fungal species were isolated from swab samples taken from instruments used by pedicurists operating at three different sites in lagos, nigeria. the bacterial isolates included micrococcus luteus, micrococcus roseus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, hafnia spp, shigella spp, bacillus subtilis and bacillus spp. the five fungal isolates were identified as aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, mucor spp, trichophyton spp and candida albicans. the presence of these microorganisms, some of which are pathogenic, is  an indication that pedicurists could be contributing towards the spread of skin and nail infections within the lagos metropolis.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == validation of microbial recovery from hydrogen peroxide-sterilized air.
AB  == the use of hydrogen peroxide as a sanitant in isolators and other barrier systems is well documented. to confirm that the isolator maintains a germ-free environment between decontamination cycles, microbiological air monitoring is performed after the sanitation and aeration cycles. in this study, we have shown  that residual levels of hydrogen peroxide as low as 1 ppm can remain in the isolator and inhibit the growth of microorganisms after concentration on agar media. this lingering hydrogen peroxide can make accurate microbiological air monitoring difficult and can even cause false negative test results. to solve this issue, we have developed a new media that can mediate the effects of residual peroxide and prevent false negative test results. initially, catalase was tested as a neutralizing agent but proved not to be efficient enough. instead, 1% pyruvate was added, which was able to tolerate as much as 15 ppm vaporous hydrogen peroxide (vhp) and ensured growth promotion of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans and aspergillus niger. the 1% pyruvate retained its neutralizing activity for micrococcus luteus at up to 100 ppm vhp. raising the pyruvate concentration to 5% pyruvate enabled neutralization of up to 300 ppm vhp, permitting subsequent growth of micrococcus luteus on agar media.

TI  == differential activation of the nf-kappab-like factors relish and dif in drosophila melanogaster by fungi and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the current model of immune activation in drosophila melanogaster suggests that fungi and gram-positive (g(+)) bacteria activate the toll/dif pathway and that gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria activate the imd/relish pathway. to test this model, we examined the response of relish and dif (dorsal-related immunity factor) mutants to challenge by various fungi and g(+) and g(-) bacteria. in relish mutants, the cecropin a gene was induced by the g(+) bacteria micrococcus  luteus and staphylococcus aureus, but not by other g(+) or g(-) bacteria. this relish-independent cecropin a induction was blocked in dif/relish double mutant flies. induction of the cecropin a1 gene by m. luteus required relish, whereas induction of the cecropin a2 gene required dif. intact peptidoglycan (pg) was necessary for this differential induction of cecropin a. pg extracted from m. luteus induced cecropin a in relish mutants, whereas pgs from the g(+) bacteria bacillus megaterium and bacillus subtilis did not, suggesting that the drosophila immune system can distinguish pgs from various g(+) bacteria. various fungi stimulated antimicrobial peptides through at least two different pathways requiring relish and/or dif. induction of attacin a by geotrichum candidum required relish, whereas activation by beauvaria bassiana required dif, suggesting that the drosophila immune system can distinguish between at least these two fungi. we conclude that the drosophila immune system is more complex than the current model. we propose a new model to account for this immune system  complexity, incorporating distinct pattern recognition receptors of the drosophila immune system, which can distinguish between various fungi and g(+) bacteria, thereby leading to selective induction of antimicrobial peptides via differential activation of relish and dif.

AB  == we have isolated and characterized a new beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein that is present in manduca sexta cuticle and hemolymph. this 52 kda protein, designated betagrp-2, is 57% identical in sequence to betagrp-1 from larval hymolymph of the same insect. betagrp-2 differs from betagrp-1 in its absence of  the naive larvae before the wandering stage begins. transcription of the betagrp-2 was up-regulated in larvae challenged with yeast or bacteria. betagrp-2 contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases but lacks glucanase activity. it aggregates yeasts and bacteria to, perhaps, limit the spread of invading cells and ensure a localized defense reaction. betagrp-2 binds laminarin and lipoteichoic acid, but not lipopolysaccharide. laminarin-triggered  prophenoloxidase activation was greatly enhanced in the induced larval hemolymph  supplemented with purified betagrp-2. complementing other studies on pattern recognition molecules in m. sexta, these results indicate that a complex system of protein sensors is an integral component of the insect immune system and that  different recognition molecules have overlapping binding specificity and functions.

TI  == [new antifungal antibiotics, bacillopeptins and fusaricidins].
AB  == we isolated four strains of bacteria producing antifungal antibiotics from the rhizosphere of garlic with basal rot caused by the plant pathogenic fungal strain fusarium oxysporum. among them, bacillus subtilis fr-2 was found to produce new antifungal antibiotics, named bacillopeptins a, b, and c. their structures have been determined by 1d and 2d nmr and ms experiments, and amino acid analysis coupled with chiral hplc, to be cyclic lipopeptides each containing a long-chain  beta-amino acid. another bacterial strain, bacillus polymyxa kt-8, was shown to produce new antifungal antibiotics named fusaricidins a, b, c, and d which are more potent than bacillopeptins in their antimicrobial activity. the structures of the fusaricidins have been elucidated similarly as bacillopeptins to be cyclic hexadepsipeptides all containing 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid as a side chain. fusaricidins strongly inhibit the growth of various kinds of fungi and moreover surprisingly show strong inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or micrococcus luteus.

AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == the antibacterial properties of secreted phospholipases a2: a major physiological role for the group iia enzyme that depends on the very high pi of the enzyme to allow penetration of the bacterial cell wall.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of human group iia secreted phospholipase a(2) against gram-positive bacteria as a result of membrane hydrolysis have been reported. using micrococcus luteus as a model system, we demonstrate the very high specificity of this human enzyme for such hydrolysis compared with the group ib, iie, iif, v, and x human secreted phospholipase a(2)s. a unique feature of the group iia enzyme is its very high pi due to a large excess of cationic residues on the enzyme surface. the importance of this global positive charge in  bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis and bacterial killing has been examined using  charge reversal mutagenesis. the global positive charge on the enzyme surface allows penetration through the bacterial cell wall, thus allowing access of this  enzyme to the cell membrane. reduced bacterial killing was associated with the loss of positive charge and reduced cell membrane hydrolysis. all mutants were highly effective in hydrolyzing the bacterial membrane of cells in which the cell wall was permeabilized with lysozyme. these same overall characteristics were also seen with suspensions of staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua, where cell membrane hydrolysis and antibacterial activity of human group iia enzyme was also lost as a result of charge reversal mutagenesis.

TI  == the presence of antibacterial and opioid peptides in human plasma during coronary artery bypass surgery.
AB  == antibacterial peptides, found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, represent a  potential innate defense mechanism against microbial infections. however, it is unknown whether this process occurs in humans during surgery. we looked for evidence of release of antibacterial peptides during coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg). we used immunological techniques and antibacterial assays combined with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, reverse-phase hplc, n-terminal sequencing and comparison with synthetic standards to characterize the peptide b/enkelytin. we show the presence of anionic antibacterial peptide, the peptide b/enkelytin which correspond to the c-terminal part of proenkephalin a, from the plasma of patients undergoing cabg. our studies show that peptide b/enkelytin is initially present at low levels in plasma and is then released in  increased amounts just after skin incision. antibacterial assays confirmed that the peptides specifically target gram-positive bacteria. we also demonstrate that peptide b/enkelytin is metabolized in vivo to the opioid peptides methionine-enkephalin-arg-phe and methionine-enkephalin, peptides that we show have granulocyte chemotactic activity. these findings suggest that in humans, surgical incision leads to the release of antibacterial peptides. furthermore, these antibacterial peptides can be metabolized into compounds that have immune-activating properties.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis by secreted phospholipases a(2): a major physiological role of human group iia spla(2) involving both bacterial cell wall  penetration and interfacial catalysis.
AB  == the ability of human group iia secreted phospholipase a(2) (human spla(2)) to hydrolyse the phospholipid membrane of whole cell suspensions of gram-positive bacteria is demonstrated in real time using a continuous fluorescence displacement assay. micrococcus luteus is used as a model system and demonstrates an almost absolute specificity for this human enzyme compared with porcine pancreatic and naja naja venom spla(2)s. this specificity is due to selective penetration of the highly cationic human spla(2)50%) phospholipid hydrolysis was  observed and this was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry that allowed the identification of several molecular species of phosphatidylglycerol as the targets for hydrolysis. however, the bactericidal activity of the human enzyme under these assay conditions was low, highlighting the capacity of the organism to survive a major phospholipid insult. in addition to pure enzyme, the human spla(2) activity in tears was demonstrated using m. luteus as substrate. in comparison to m. luteus, cell suspensions of staphylococcus aureus were highly resistant to hydrolysis by human spla(2) as well as to the pancreatic and venom enzymes. treatment of this organism with the specific cell wall protease lysostaphin resulted in a dramatic enhancement in cell membrane phospholipid hydrolysis by all three spla(2)s. overall, the results highlight the potential of the human spla(2) as a selective antimicrobial agent against gram-positive bacteria in vivo because this enzyme is essentially inactive against mammalian plasma membranes. however, the enzyme will be most effective in combination with  other antimicrobial agents that enhance the permeability of the bacterial cell wall and where potentiation of the effectiveness of other antibiotics would be expected.

TI  == multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of antibiotic effects on membrane potential, membrane permeability, and bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus.
AB  == although flow cytometry has been used to study antibiotic effects on bacterial membrane potential (mp) and membrane permeability, flow cytometric results are not always well correlated to changes in bacterial counts. using new, precise techniques, we simultaneously measured mp, membrane permeability, and particle counts of antibiotic-treated and untreated staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus  luteus cells. mp was calculated from the ratio of red and green fluorescence of diethyloxacarbocyanine [dioc(2)(3)]. a normalized permeability parameter was calculated from the ratio of far red fluorescence of the nucleic acid dye to-pro-3 and green dioc(2)(3) fluorescence. bacterial counts were calculated by the addition of polystyrene beads to the sample at a known concentration. amoxicillin increased permeability within 45 min. at concentrations of <1 microg/ml, some organisms showed increased permeability but normal mp; this population disappeared after 4 h, while bacterial counts increased. at amoxicillin concentrations above 1 microg/ml, mp decreased irreversibly and the particle counts did not increase. tetracycline and erythromycin caused smaller, dose- and time-dependent decreases in mp. tetracycline concentrations of <1 microg/ml did not change permeability, while a tetracycline concentration of 4 microg/ml permeabilized 50% of the bacteria; 4 microg of erythromycin per ml permeabilized 20% of the bacteria. streptomycin decreased mp substantially, with  no effect on permeability; chloramphenicol did not change either permeability or  mp. erythromycin pretreatment of bacteria prevented streptomycin and amoxicillin  effects. flow cytometry provides a sensitive means of monitoring the dynamic cellular events that occur in bacteria exposed to antibacterial agents; however,  it is probably simplistic to expect that changes in a single cellular parameter will suffice to determine the sensitivities of all species to all drugs.

TI  == stresgenin b, an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein gene expression, produced by streptomyces sp. as-9.
AB  == stresgenin b was isolated as an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein (hsp) gene expression from a culture broth of streptomyces sp. as-9 by silica gel chromatography and hplc. the molecular formula of the novel compound was determined as c11h13no5 by high resolution fab-ms analysis, and the structure was determined by uv, 1h nmr, 13c nmr, hmqc, hmbc, and noesy spectra. stresgenin b inhibited heat-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the human  hsp70b promoter in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells at concentrations lower than the concentrations for inhibition of dexamethasone-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv)-ltr promoter. the inhibition of heat-induced reporter gene expression was evident even when cells were exposed to stresgenin b only during heat stress treatment. moreover, the compound inhibited heat-induced syntheses of hsp72/73, hsp90, and hsp110 and thereby suppressed the induction of thermotolerance. stresgenin b showed moderate cytotoxic activities against several neoplastic cell lines and also showed antibacterial activities against micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus strains.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from senecio graveolens (compositae) was analyzed by glc-ms and the components identified were: isovaleraldehyde, alpha-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinene, p-cymene, sabinene, gamma-terpinene, 1-methyl-4-isopropenylbenzene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, piperitenone, alpha- and beta-eudesmol. the investigation by the agar-well diffusion method of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil proved that it has antibacterial effects on micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal effects on clinically isolated candida albicans. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for m. luteus, oxacillin-sensitive s. aureus and c. albicans were 8.73, 10.91 and 2.13 x 10(-2) mg/ml, respectively. the antimicrobial activity related to known antibiotics was calculated. these results would be compatible with a potential concentration-dependent selectivity  of antifungal effect of s. graveolens essential oil. minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) is above 87.3 mg/ml. thus the mbc:mic ratio would be clearly  higher than 1 (above 8), indicating a bacteriostatic effect of the essential oil.

TI  == identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  == classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. a routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin,  zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. carbadox can be detected by uv light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). the method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (tlc), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by tlc. five test bacteria were used for the main detection  by agar diffusion: micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p, corynebacterium xerosis nctc 9755, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, and b. subtilis atcc 6633. identification after tlc was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). this method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of  the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are  available. qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. this last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus c55 was shown to produce bacteriocin activity comprising three distinct peptide components, termed staphylococcins c55alpha, c55beta, and  c55gamma. the three peptides were purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed  by xad-2 and reversed-phase (c8 and c18) chromatography. the yield following c8 chromatography was about 86%, with a more-than-300-fold increase in specific activity. when combined in approximately equimolar amounts, staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta acted synergistically to kill s. aureus or micrococcus luteus but not s. epidermidis strains. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of all three peptides were obtained and staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta were shown  to be lanthionine-containing (lantibiotic) molecules with molecular weights of 3,339 and 2,993, respectively. the c55gamma peptide did not appear to be a lantibiotic, nor did it augment the inhibitory activities of staphylococcin c55alpha and/or c55beta. plasmids of 2. 5 and 32.0 kb are present in strain c55,  and following growth of this strain at elevated temperature (42 degreesc), a large proportion of the progeny failed to produce strong bacteriocin activity and also lost the 32.0-kb plasmid. protoplast transformation of these bacteria with purified 32-kb plasmid dna regenerates the ability to produce the strong bacteriocin activity.

TI  == characterization of antibacterial cooh-terminal proenkephalin-a-derived peptides  (peap) in infectious fluids. importance of enkelytin, the antibacterial peap209-237 secreted by stimulated chromaffin cells.
AB  == proenkephalin-a (pea) and its derived peptides (peap) have been described in neural, neuroendocrine tissues and immune cells. the processing of pea has been extensively studied in the adrenal medulla chromaffin cell showing that maturation starts with the removal of the carboxyl-terminal peap209-239. in 1995, our laboratory has shown that antibacterial activity is present within the intragranular chromaffin granule matrix and in the extracellular medium following exocytosis. more recently, we have identified an intragranular peptide, named enkelytin, corresponding to the bisphosphorylated peap209-237, that inhibits the  growth of micrococcus luteus (goumon, y., strub, j. m., moniatte, m., nullans, g., poteur, l., hubert, p., van dorsselaer, a., aunis, d., and metz-boutigue, m.  h. (1996) eur. j. biochem. 235, 516-525). as a continuation of this previous study, in order to characterize the biological function of antibacterial peap, we have here examined whether this cooh-terminal fragment is released from stimulated chromaffin cells and whether it could be detected in wound fluids and  in polymorphonuclear secretions following cell stimulation. the antibacterial spectrum shows that enkelytin is active against several gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, but it is unable to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria growth. in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with  structural features, various synthetic enkelytin-derived peptides were tested. we also propose a computer model of synthetic peap209-237 deduced from 1h nmr analysis, in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with the three-dimensional structure. finally, we report the high phylogenetic conservation of the cooh-terminal peap, which implies some important biological function and we discuss the putative importance of enkelytin in the defensive processes.

TI  == production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of bifidobacterium longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. at the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic  and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. in a single cultivation of bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. to increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of b. longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by b. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by p. freudenreichii, was done using tpy medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. by the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. the antimicrobial  activities of the mixture against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus were  35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of b. longum alone. when the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of b. longum and p. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using tpy medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for m. luteus, pseudomonas sp. and s. aureus, respectively.

AB  == peptidoglycan (pg), a component of the bacterial cell wall, has various immunomodulating activities, including the capacity to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to antigens administered in freund's adjuvant. we report that pg induces interleukin-12 (il-12) mrna production and il-12 secretion by mouse macrophages. the capacity of pg to induce il-12 production, like its previously reported immunomodulating activities, was dependent on the structure of its peptide subunit. pg from bacillus megaterium and staphylococcus aureus induced il-12 production, whereas pg from micrococcus luteus and corynebacterium  poinsettiae did not. the ability of most bacterial pgs to induce il-12 production suggests that they play an important role in triggering host defense mechanisms against bacterial infections.

AB  == achromobacter beta-lytic protease (blp), one of the bacteriolytic proteases secreted by achromobacter lyticus, exhibited both peptidase and bacteriolytic activities at alkaline ph. the protease was strongly inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, and one zinc atom was detected in the molecule by ion-spray  mass spectrometry. the zinc-protease specifically cleaved gly-x bonds in peptides and possibly possessed subsites s2, s1, s1', and s2' for binding substrate [schecter, i. and berger, a. (1967) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 27, 157-162].  blp lysed staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus cells more efficiently than achromobacter alpha-lytic protease (alp) and lysozyme, thus being responsible for the high bacteriolytic activity of a. lyticus. in the lysis of bacterial cell walls, blp hydrolyzed both the d-ala-gly/ala bond at the linkage between the peptide subunit and the interpeptide and the gly-gly bond in the interpeptide bridge. these results indicate that blp is a highly active bacteriolytic enzyme with a broad bacteriolytic spectrum, which acts primarily by splitting the linkage between the peptide subunit and the interpeptide in the peptidoglycan.

TI  == hyperproduction of alpha-toxin by staphylococcus aureus results in paradoxically  reduced virulence in experimental endocarditis: a host defense role for platelet  microbicidal proteins.
AB  == staphylococcal alpha-toxin targets several cell types which are important components of cardiac vegetations in endocarditis, including platelets, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells. we evaluated the in vivo role of staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin in experimental endocarditis by using isogenic  strains differing in the capacity to produce functional alpha-toxin, including 8325-4 (wild-type strain), du-1090 (a mutant strain with allelic replacement of the alpha-toxin gene [hla]), du1090(ph35l) (a mutant strain producing a target cell-binding but nonlytic toxin), du1090(pdu1212) (a variant of du1090 carrying the cloned hla gene on a multicopy plasmid), and du1090(pcl84::hla) (a variant of du1090 with a single copy of the hla gene cloned into the chromosomal lipase locus). in vitro, wild-type alpha-toxin (from parental strain 8325-4) extensively lysed both erythrocytes and platelets. in contrast, mutant alpha-toxin [from strain du1090(ph35l)] lysed neither cell type. following exposure to the wild-type alpha-toxin, platelet lysates were found to contain microbicidal activity against bacillus subtilis (but not against micrococcus luteus), as well  as against the parental and alpha-toxin variant s. aureus strains noted above. furthermore, lysate microbicidal activity was heat stable, neutralized by polyanionic filters or compounds, and recoverable from anionic filter membranes by hypertonic saline elution. these characteristics are consistent with those of  cationic platelet microbicidal proteins (pmps). reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of three distinct pmps (1, 2, and 3) in platelet lysates. in experimental endocarditis, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing either minimal alpha-toxin or nonlytic alpha-toxin in vitro [strains du1090 and du1090(ph35l), respectively] exhibited significantly lower virulence in vivo than the parental strain (decreased intravegetation staphylococcal densities). paradoxically, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing alpha-toxin at supraparental levels in vitro [strains du1090(p1212) and du1090(pcl84::hla)] also exhibited significantly decreased induction rates and intravegetation staphylococcal densities in experimental endocarditis versus the parental strain. the reduced in vivo virulence of the latter variant staphylococcal strains could  not be explained by differences in bacteremic clearance or initial adherence to sterile vegetations (compared to the parental strain). these findings suggest that the reduced virulence exhibited by the variant staphylococcal strains in this model was related to pathogenetic events subsequent to bacterial adherence to the damaged endocardium. excess intravegetation secretion of alpha-toxin, leading to increased pmp release (secondary to either increased platelet secretion or lysis), may well explain the reduced virulence observed in experimental endocarditis.

AB  == background: stethoscope diaphragms have been shown to harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria. objectives: to assess bacterial contamination on the diaphragm and under the plastic rim that secures the diaphragm of stethoscopes of physicians, nurses, medical students, and house staff in an intensive care unit and a general medical ward of a large university hospital. also to compare the effectiveness of various cleaning agents and assess the transmissibility of bacteria from contaminated stethoscopes to human skin. methods: aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed on 40 randomly selected stethoscopes. we compared the effects of isopropyl alcohol, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), and benzalkonium chloride swabs, as well as soap and water, on reducing bacterial contamination on the stethoscope diaphragm and under the rim. the transmissibility of micrococcus luteus inoculated onto a stethoscope diaphragm to clean human skin was also determined. results: eleven genera and species of bacteria were isolated, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus present on 100% of stethoscopes and staphylococcus aureus on 38%. clostridium difficile was not isolated. the mean (+/-se) number of total colony-forming units was 158 +/- 33 per diaphragm and 289 +/- 54 per rim. physicians' stethoscope diaphragms had significantly more colony-forming units of coagulase-negative staphylococci than  those of nurses: 163 +/- 44 vs 50 +/- 12, respectively (p = .02). the most effective cleaning agent was isopropyl alcohol after cleaning the diaphragm surface, the stethoscope diaphragms contained 0.2 +/- 0.2 colony-forming units and the rims contained 2.2 +/- 1.5 colony-forming units (p = .01). in addition, m luteus was transferred from inoculated stethoscopes to human skin. conclusions: most stethoscopes harbor potential pathogens but are not a source of c difficile. physicians' stethoscopes generally had a higher bacterial load than nurses' stethoscopes. isopropyl alcohol is an effective cleaning agent when applied to the stethoscope diaphragm. stethoscopes transfer m luteus to human skin, making it likely that other bacteria can be transferred as well.

TI  == identification and isolation of a bactericidal domain in chicken egg white lysozyme.
AB  == chicken egg white lysozyme exhibits antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of clostripain-digested lysozyme yielded a pentadecapeptide with antimicrobial activity but without muramidase activity. the peptide was isolated and its sequence found to be i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m-n-a-w-v-a-w-r (amino acids 98-112 of chicken egg white lysozyme). a synthesized peptide of identical sequence had the same bactericidal activity as the natural peptide. replacement of trp 108 with tyrosine significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide. by replacement of trp 111 with tyrosine the antibacterial activity was lost. replacement of asn 106 with the positively charged arginine strongly increased the antibacterial capacity of i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m-n-a-w-v-a-w-r. the peptide i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m consisting of the eight amino acids of the n-terminal side had no bactericidal properties, whereas  the peptide n-a-w-v-a-w-r of the c-terminal side retained some bactericidal activity. replacement of asparagine 106 by arginine (r-a-w-v-a-w-r) increased the bactericidal activity considerably. the d enantiomer of r-a-w-v-a-w-r was as active as the l form against five of the tested bacteria, but substantially less  active against serratia marcescens, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lentus. for these bacterial species some stereospecific complementarity between receptor structures of the bacteria and the peptide can be assumed.

TI  == susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == the photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd-arg(2)) on the growth of selected pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd). growth inhibition  of hpd-arg(2) of three gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated hpd-arg(2) or hpd. the antimicrobial activity of light-activated hpd-arg(2) against p. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.

AB  == a nocardioform actinomycete, scc 1886, isolated from a soil sample collected in ohio was found to produce, in fermentation, six novel macrocyclic lactones, the saccharocarcins. the producing culture was identified as saccharothrix aerocolonigenes subsp. antibiotica based on the formation of fragmenting substrate mycelia, aerial mycelia that coalesce to form aerial colonies, whole-cell hydrolysates that contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, galactose and rhamnose and physiological comparisons to type species of the genus. peak production of the saccharocarcins occurred after 95 hours of fermentation in a starch rich medium. the compounds were isolated from the fermentation broth by solvent extraction and purified by hplc. isolated compounds were active against micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and chlamydia trachomatis; none were cytotoxic at concentrations up to 1.0 microgram/ml.

TI  == nahua indian medicinal plants (mexico): inhibitory activity on nf-kappab as an anti-inflammatory model and antibacterial effects.
AB  == selected plants documented as medicinal in an ethnobotanical study with the nahua of the sierra de zongolica (veracruz, mexico) were evaluated for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity. one of the potential sides of action of anti-inflammatory drugs is the transcription factor nf-kappab. this factor is essential for the immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses. we therefore tested extracts from a total of 28 plants used by the nahua indians for their potential effect on the activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab. the leaves of tithonia diversifolia (hemsl.) a. gray (asteraceae) was the only extract which showed inhibitory activity. nonspecific dna binding activities were not noticably influenced. phytochemical studies to isolate the active principle and further biochemical studies in order to better understand the mode of action  of this nf-kappab inhibitor have been initiated. five plants showed noteworthy antibacterial activity against some pathogenic (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25933  and yersinia enterocolitica 03) and nonpathogenic (e. coli dsm 1077, micrococcus  luteus dsm 348) microorganism: acacia cornigera, cuscuta tinctoria, ludwigia octovalvis, lysiloma divaricata, and tithonia diversifolia.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria and yeasts on agar surfaces with high power nd:yag laser light.
AB  == near infrared light from a high-powered, 1064 nm, neodymium:yttrium aluminium garnet (nd:yag) laser killed a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and two yeasts, lawned on nutrient agar plates. a beam (cross-sectional  area, 1.65 cm2) of laser light was delivered in 10 j, 8 ms pulses at 10 hz, in a  series of exposure times. for each microbial species, a dose/response curve was obtained of area of inactivation vs energy density (j cm-2). the energy density that gave an inactivation area (ia) equal to 50% of the beam area was designated  the ia50-value and was plotted together with its 95% confidence limits. average ia50-values were all within a threefold range and varied from 1768 j cm-2 for serratia marcescens to 4489 j cm-2 for vegetative cells of bacillus stearothermophilus. there were no systematic differences in sensitivity attributable to cell shape, size, pigmentation or gram reaction. at the lowest energy densities where inactivation was achieved for the majority of organisms (around 2000 j cm-2), no effect was observed on the nutrient agar surface, but as the energy density was increased, a depression in the agar surface was formed, followed by localized melting of the agar.

TI  == highly selective acridine and ethidium staining of bacterial dna and rna.
AB  == the acridine dyes acridine orange (ao) and coriphosphine o (cpo) and ethidium bromide (etbr) were used to stain bacterial digests after electrophoresis in native and denaturing (sds) polyacrylamide gels and were shown to stain dna and rna preferentially over other subcellular components in the gels. vegetative cell digests of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus showed intense staining of dna with ao and cpo near the top of the gel, but little or no staining of other cellular constituents. etbr stained both dna and rna in the gels. protein standards and non-nucleic acid cellular constituents stained faintly with high concentrations (> or = 100 microm) of ao, lower concentrations (13.9 microm) of cpo, and did not stain with  0.5 microgram/ml etbr in denaturing gels. the complete set of cellular biochemicals was visualized by silver staining, while the protein subset was detected by coomassie blue staining. the highest concentrations of ao (120 microm) and cpo (13.9 microm) were shown to detect purified dna in gels with a sensitivity in the range of 25-50 ng per band. this work demonstrates the specificity of acridine and ethidium dyes for nucleic acids, while illustrating the level of non-nucleic acid-specific interactions with other cellular components by staining of electrophoretically separated cellular components in a  gel matrix.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of spermidine-based mixed catechol- and hydroxamate-containing siderophore--vancomycin conjugates.
AB  == the first antibiotic conjugates of vancomycin (1) and siderophore analogues containing spermidine-based catechol ligands (conjugate 11) as well as mixed catechol and hydroxamate ligands (conjugate 13) are described. the design of the  conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. the novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against gram-negative bacteria under  iron-sufficient conditions. however, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == humoral defense of the nematode ascaris suum: antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating activities in the body fluid.
AB  == three humoral defense activities (antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating) were detected in the body fluid of the nematode ascaris suum. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) were more sensitive to the antibacterial activity than the gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli). the antibacterial activity was heat stable and was lost by trypsin digestion. the molecular mass of the factor responsible for antibacterial activity was estimated as 6 kda. the bacteriolytic activity against dried micrococcus luteus was also detected. the bacteriolytic factor was 6-9 kda in molecular mass, heat sensitive  and trypsin sensitive. both e. coli and glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsin-treated human a-type red blood cells were agglutinated in the body fluid. an analytical gel permeation hplc revealed the agglutinating activity consists of at least two  factors. activities of both agglutinating factors were lost by heat treatment or  trypsin digestion. the molecular masses estimated for the two agglutinating factors were 500 kda and 25 kda. under experimental conditions, microbe-injection was not a prerequisite for the appearance of these defense activities.

TI  == mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  == mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (s. chatterjee, d. k. chatterjee, r. h. jani, j. blumbach, b. n. ganguli, n. klesel, m. limbert, and g. seibert, j. antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). incubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. biosyntheses of dna, rna, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and d-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. thus, unlike type a lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. the formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. in contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. these data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == total structures and antimicrobial activity of bacitracin minor components.
AB  == total structures of 13 minor components of bacitracin (bc) were proposed, and their antimicrobial activities were investigated. the components of bc including  bacitracins a (bc-a) and f (bc-f) were isolated by preparative hplc and were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. the resulting amino aids were derivatized with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanineamide and were separated by hplc to determine their absolute configurations. it was found that the n-terminal amino acids of bc-a and its related components were epimerized during the hydrolysis to yield their enantiomers. the formation of these artifactual amino acids suggests  that our previously proposed structures of the bc minor components are incorrect; therefore, the structures were corrected based on these results. the structures of the bc minor components were the same as that of bcs-a and -f except that one  to three of the l-isoleucines, including the n-terminal one, were replaced by l-valines. these structures were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry under fast atom bombardment (fab) conditions and frit-fab liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. based on the uv spectra of the bc components determined by photodiode array detection-hplc analysis, a new systematic nonmenclature was proposed for the minor components. the isolated components were also used for the determination of their minimal inhibition concentrations and it was found that bc-a is 2 approximately 8 times more potent than the other minor components against strains of micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

(1990) j. bacteriol., 172, 6494-6498). the proteins include p1, p2, p7, p9, px, p13, p18 and other minor components. at the stationary growth phase, the bacteriolytic band-profile of the triton x-100 extract changed dramatically. p1,  p7 and p9 disappeared, and the other minor bands had markedly decreased band intensities. on the other hand, p2, px, p13, and p18 retained their band intensities during the stationary growth phase. the band intensities of p7, p13,  px, and p18 increased in the supernatant during the logarithmic growth phase. these results indicated that the bacteriolytic band-profile changes during growth.

'kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low  concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. it was synergistic with chlorhexidine against s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and ctab. chlorhexidine was more broadly active than ctab but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. it was more rapidly bactericidal to p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens than to s. aureus. stable resistance to chlorhexidine and ctab was developed by p. aeruginosa and s. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to ctab. the antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. the importance of standardization of  media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.

TI  == the ability of bacteria to synthesize a new cyclopyrophosphate correlates with their tolerance to redox-cycling drugs: on a crossroad of chemotherapy, environmental toxicology and immunobiochemical problems.

AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == the rubomycin complex produced by streptomyces coeruleorubidus 4-157 was studied  and the two novel anthracyclines i.e. rubomycins f and h were isolated. the study of the physicochemical properties of the novel antibiotics in comparison with rubomycin c (daunomycin) and the specially prepared 3'-n-carbmethoxyrubomycin c showed that rubomycin f was 3'-n-carbethoxydaunomycin and rubomycin h was 3'-n-carbmethoxydaunomycin. therefore, rubomycins f and h are novel representatives of natural anthracyclines undescribed previously.

TI  == hemolytic interactions of dermatophilus congolensis.
AB  == the strains of dermatophilus congolensis grew on blood agar with washed sheep erythrocytes with marked total hemolysis. in testing for hemolytic interactions they gave a significant synergistic effect of a characteristic shape with rhodococcus equi and streptococcus agalactiae, whereas with staphylococcus aureus producing beta hemolysin and with staphylococcus aureus producing delta hemolysin a simultaneous synergistic as well as antagonistic effect were observed. first of all a conspicuous inhibition of in the beta hemolysin zone began and then the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis was enhanced. a similar double reaction was also observed with listeria ivanovii. with delta hemolysin there was an inhibition of the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis and at the same time a synergistic effect could be observed. also d. congolensis gave a weak synergistic effect with micrococcus lylae and listeria monocytogenes, and a further weak antagonistic effect with alpha hemolysin of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus chromogenes and micrococcus luteus. no interaction of d. congolensis was established with corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == partial characterization and staphylocidal activity of thrombin-induced platelet  microbicidal protein.
AB  == thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (pmp) is considered to play an important role in preventing an important role in preventing streptococcal endocarditis. however, the structural features and functions of pmps have not been well characterized, and their antibacterial spectra against other common endocarditis pathogens, such as the staphylococci, are not known. thrombin stimulation of washed rabbit platelets (10(8)/ml) yielded a pmp-rich preparation  with a specific activity of approximately 25 u/mg of protein as determined by bacillus subtilis bioassay. twenty-eight clinical and laboratory staphylococcus aureus isolates, exposed to a standardized pmp preparation (100 u/ml for 2 h at 37 degrees c), exhibited a poisson-distributed heterogeneity to the bactericidal  action of pmp, with approximately one-third designated as pmp resistant. gel filtration chromatography (sephadex g-50) identified the bioactive moiety within  pmp preparations to be in the major protein elution peak; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) presumptively identified pmp as a low-molecular-weight (mw) (8,500) protein present only in such bioactive protein peaks. both the bioactivity of pmp preparations and the low-mw protein band were removable by specific anionic membranes (e.g., cellulose-acetate/nitrate), as well as by a variety of anionic resins, further corroborating the suspected cationic charge of pmp. in addition, both pmp bioactivity and the low-mw protein band were recoverable by 1.5 m nacl elution of the anionic membrane filters post-pmp adsorptive removal. adsorption of bioactive pmp preparations by highly pmp-susceptible b. subtilis (10(8) cfu/ml, 30 min) resulted in a near-complete loss of residual bioactivity; in contrast, adsorption of bioactive pmp preparations with less pmp-susceptible s. aureus strains failed  to reduce bioactivity. significant lysozyme contamination of pmp-rich preparations was ruled out by determination of differences between bioactive pmp  preparations and exogenous lysozyme as regards (i) relative heat stabilities; (ii) differential bactericidal activity versus b. subtilis and micrococcus luteus; and (iii) sds-page protein profiles. these data show that the bioactive pmp protein moiety is of low mw, is heat stable, is probably cationic (similar to leukocyte-derived defensins), and possesses potent bactericidal activity against  a significant percentage of s. aureus isolates.

TI  == location of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid on the cell wall surface of staphylococcus aureus as determined by immunoelectron microscopy.
AB  == anti-peptidoglycan (pg) and anti-teichoic acid (ta) antibodies were prepared from sera of rabbits immunized with the cell wall fraction of staphylococcus aureus cowan i by the specific adsorption technique with purified teichoic acid or peptidoglycan. the anti-pg antibody recognized the trichloroacetic acid-treated walls (tca wall) prepared from s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and micrococcus luteus but did not react with teichoic acid or proteins extracted from the cell wall of staphylococcus. the anti-ta antibody specifically reacted with cell wall  teichoic acid of beta-type sugar configuration. the reaction sites of these antibodies on the cell wall of s. aureus wood 46 were determined by immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold as a probe. the anti-ta antibody reacted mostly with the fibrous electron-dense mass on the cell surface. the reaction was also seen on the inner surface of the cell wall. the anti-pg antibody reacted with the fibrous structures and also directly on the cell wall surface. the distribution of the probes on the cell wall surface examined with the scanning electron microscope showed that there was no localized distribution  in respect to the cell division. we knew from these observations that the external surface of the cell wall of staphylococcus is covered with the fibrous mass which consists mostly of teichoic acid but partially of peptidoglycan.

AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == [value of the technique of cellular lysis by thermic shock in the isolation of bacteria causing osteoarticular infections].
AB  == the purpose of this work is to compare, a conventional technique, for bacterial isolation, with a lysis-centrifugation method using a rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by decongelation at 37 degrees c for bone and joint samples. the bone and joint specimens were biopsies and punctions (35 cases) or fistula (10 cases). the residual antibiotic activity of the sample was determined using a susceptible strain of micrococcus luteus and of staphylococcus epidermidis. among the 45 samples, 20 were sterile with both methods among which 8 exhibited a residual antibiotic activity which may have contributed to isolation failure. in  12 cases, bacterial isolates were obtained with both methods. cultures were obtained from 13 samples with the lysis centrifugation method alone. the isolates were 4 staphylococcus aureus, 8 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 1 acinetobacter sp. these results suggest that the intracellular location of bacteria may be responsible for the negative cultures from bone or joint specimens.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

AB  == data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin g10x, a preparation of lytic enzymes from bacillus subtilis sk-52 are presented. lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. when it was used as a  substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in b. brevis, b. cereus, b. pumilis, b. subtilis and s. faecalis. preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. sometimes the increase was very high (b. sphaericus, b. subtilis 720, e. coli k12 and mre-600). such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (b. cereus 1312, c. renale, m. luteus, s. aureus kp, 800, 805 and 126001, s. pyogenes 291). an increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. however, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with  its 10 times higher doses. an increase in the lysis level was also achieved with  increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. its use in veterinary was a success.

AB  == the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus  luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable  (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.

AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == wheat germ agglutinin potentiates uptake of bacteria by murine peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == exposure of thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages to wheat germ agglutinin (wga) increased markedly the uptake of six different bacteria, which have surface receptors for the lectin. uptake of staphylococcus aureus h was higher by 3-5-fold, of s. aureus 52a2 by 1.8-fold, of s. aureus 52a5 by 1.7-fold, of s. albus by 2.3-fold, of shigella flexneri by 6-fold and of micrococcus luteus by 6.5-fold. klebsiella pneumoniae, devoid of receptors for wga, was not phagocytosed following pretreatment of macrophages with the lectin. pretreatment  of the bacteria with the lectin also resulted, in most cases, in an increase in phagocytosis. interaction of wga with the macrophages and with the bacteria, as well as the potentiation of phagocytosis, was abolished by tri-n-acetylchitotriose, a saccharide that binds specifically to wga, but not by  monosaccharides which do not interact with this lectin. with non-elicited macrophages, enhancement of phagocytosis by wga was less pronounced, probably because of the higher number of lectin-binding sites (5-fold) on the elicited cells. peanut agglutinin and soybean agglutinin, that bind to macrophages but not to the bacteria studied, lack the ability to potentiate phagocytosis. macrophage  surface sugars thus appear to play an important role in phagocytosis by serving as receptors for lectins that form bridges between the macrophages and the microorganisms.

TI  == [reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. 1. the range of immunological specificity of staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic features of s. aureus peptidoglycan (pg) were studied in the reaction of stimulation of oxygen-dependent neutrophil metabolism, mediated by the igg opsonins of normal human serum. the study was carried out at different taxonomic levels: the species (s. aureus), the genus (staphylococcus), the family (micrococcaceae), as well as in relation to remote taxons (organisms belonging to the families streptococcaceae, enterobacteriaceae, neisseriaceae, to the genus corynebacterium). all s. aureus strains were identical with respect to the specificity of their pg, essentially differing from other bacteria in this regard. after the removal of antibodies to different pg the effectiveness of pg opsonization decreased by 10.4-44.7%. such decrease was most pronounced in experiments with the pg of streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. faecalis, s. salivarius) and micrococcus luteus.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus peptidoglycan transglycosylases that are not penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == major peptidoglycan transglycosylase activities, which synthesize uncross-linked  peptidoglycan from lipid-linked precursors, were solubilized from the membranes of staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus and were partially purified. the  transglycosylase activities were separated from penicillin-binding proteins by solubilization and by purification steps. therefore, we concluded that these activities were not activities of the penicillin-binding proteins, which are the  presumptive peptidoglycan transpeptidases in these gram-positive cocci. unlike escherichia coli, in which the network structure of peptidoglycan is synthesized  by multiple two-headed penicillin-binding proteins with both transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities, these gram-positive cocci have cell wall peptidoglycan which seems to be synthesized by penicillin-binding protein transpeptidases and a separate transglycosylase.

AB  == biochemical and physical properties of the pure bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by three different staphylococcus species (s. aureus, s. simulans, and s. saprophyticus) were investigated. although the three enzymes have previously been shown to share the same specificity of action (endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase  activity), their biochemical features clearly indicated that they were three different enzymes, confirming what had previously been suggested by the different lytic-activity patterns displayed by each species and the different procedures needed to achieve purification of each enzyme. very different values resulted from molecular weight determination: 80,000 for the s. aureus enzyme, 45,000 for  the s. simulans enzyme and 31,000 for the s. saprophyticus enzyme. other important differences were observed in their kinetics of activity on micrococcus  luteus purified cell walls; their stability; their bacteriolytic spectrum against heat-killed cells of various microorganisms; and their response to physical and chemical factors, such as temperature, ph, ionic strength, divalent cations, chelating agents, thiol compounds, and glucose derivatives.

AB  == the effect of antibiotic a1-87 on the fatty acid composition of s. aureus 209, e. coli o26 and m. luteus 169 significantly differing in this property was studied.  the sub-bacteriostatic doses of the preparation induced the appearance of unsaturated fatty acids in s. aureus 209. these acids were not detected in the control cultures. they also significantly increased the content of the saturated  branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms in this culture and decreased the content of the fatty acid of the same type with 19 carbon atoms. in e. coli o25 there was an almost two-fold increase in the content of the unsaturated straight  chain fatty acids with a respective decrease in the content of cyclopropanoic acid and a markedly pronounced decrease in the content of nonadecanoic acid. in m. luteus 169 the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms increased, while the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids  (c16:1, c18:1) decreased, the content of hexadecanoic acid being decreased almost two times. according to the present status the differences in the fatty acid composition of the above organisms are interpreted as one of the mechanisms increasing the membrane permeability.

TI  == lack of influence of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms.
AB  == many commonly used pharmaceutical agents have been found to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. determinations of antimicrobial concentrations in sera of patients taking nonrecognized antibacterial agents could possibly be altered if bioassay systems are utilized for the determinations. we therefore attempted to determine the in vitro effect of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms. fifty-one different agents (antihistamines, anticholinergics, central  nervous system agents, cardiovascular agents, analgesics, steroids, muscle blockers, and other miscellaneous agents) were tested for inhibition or enhancement of the growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the agents tested exhibited any effect on standard in vitro bioassay organisms. nortriptyline hydrochloride inhibited the growth of b. subtilis and m. luteus at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml (zones of inhibition, 14 and 13 mm, respectively), but no inhibition was observed with concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml or lower.

TI  == purification and characterization of three separate bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus simulans, and staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  == as a further development of previous investigations showing that different staphylococcal species display different bacteriolytic activity patterns (lyogroups), the bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by three different staphylococcus species, staphylococcus aureus (lyogroup i), s. simulans (lyogroup ii), and s. saprophyticus (lyogroup iv); have been purified and characterized. a representative strain from each species was grown in a preselected medium made of fully dialyzable products. culture supernatants were collected in the appropriate growth phase. two different affinity adsorbents were used for enzyme purification. one was obtained by coupling lysozyme-digested pure peptidoglycan from micrococcus luteus to cyanogen bromide-activated sepharose 4b. the second affinity adsorbent used was chitin. the s. aureus bacteriolytic enzyme bound to the solubilized peptidoglycan but not to chitin, whereas the opposite was true for the s. simulans enzyme. the bacteriolytic enzyme from s. saprophyticus did not bind to either the sepharose 4b-peptidoglycan resin or to chitin, and its purification was achieved by two ion-exchange chromatography steps combined with  gel filtration. all three enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity. their subsequent characterization indicated that all acted as endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidases. however, the three glucosaminidases differed  significantly in their kinetics of activity and bacteriolytic spectrum against heat-killed cells of a variety of microorganisms. very different values also resulted from molecular weight determinations: 80,000 for the s. aureus enzyme, 45,000 for the s. simulans enzyme, and 31,000 for the s. saprophyticus enzyme. other important differences were observed in their stability, optimal ph and ionic strength for their activity, and their responses to temperature and divalent cations. these results confirmed the previous proposal that different staphylococcal species excrete different lytic enzymes.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  == insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (c8 to c18) were synthesized. the insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. the  insoluble agent [c12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a c12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. c12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but c12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. this washing became ineffective  after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. such c12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 n naoh treatment. the antibacterial activity of c12(50) depended on its surface area. it showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. but the activities of c12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. the antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against escherichia coli and micrococcus luteus under various conditions. the activity of c12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. the activity of c12(50) decreased on addition of nacl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 m sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. c12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. the mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against e. coli and m. luteus was similar to that of c12(50) except for the influence of e. coli cell concentration.

TI  == antibody levels to bacterial peptidoglycan in human sera during the time course of endocarditis and bacteremic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == sera from patients with endocarditis and bacteremia due to staphylococcus aureus  were compared for peptidoglycan-binding capacity with those from normal blood donors. those patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics had higher antigen-binding levels than normal donors and patients treated exclusively with vancomycin (p less than 0.01). the factor responsible for this activity was purified by affinity chromatography from a normal donor and shown to be an immunoglobulin. specificity studies indicated that the immunodominant determinant was a peptide sequence found in peptidoglycan precursors. since soluble peptidoglycan molecules having the precursor peptide sequence are known to be secreted by some gram-positive bacteria like micrococcus luteus when grown in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, these soluble molecules may constitute the "natural" immunogen. such a hypothesis is consistent with the study of the peptidoglycan-binding capacities in the sera of these patients during the course  of treatment. for most of the responding patients studied (four of four with bacteremia and seven of nine with endocarditis), a significant increase in peptidoglycan-binding capacity was observed in sera taken 1 to 5 weeks after the  initiation of beta-lactam antibiotic therapy (compared with the initial serum studied). no such increase in the peptidoglycan-binding capacity over a similar time span was noted in the sera of people not receiving beta-lactam antibiotics (none of seven).

AB  == wheat germ agglutinin was found to agglutinate cells of escherichia coli pat 84,  micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus h, and of s. aureus 52a5, but not cells of s. aureus 52a2. interaction of wheat germ agglutinin with a soluble linear peptidoglycan secreted by micrococcus luteus and with the teichoic acid of s. aureus h was demonstrated by agar gel diffusion, quantitative precipitation and inhibition of hemagglutination of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. no interaction could be demonstrated with the teichoic acid from a phage-resistant mutant (s. aureus 52a2) which lacks a-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues. all interactions were specifically inhibited by low concentrations of chitotriose (glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnac) and the bacterial cell wall tetrasaccharide, glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnac. hemagglutination-inhibition experiments showed that the linear peptidoglycan and  the teichoic acid of s. aureus h were several thousand times more potent inhibitors of wheat germ agglutinin than was n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. comparison of the efficiency of different saccharides in inhibition of hemagglutination and  precipitation of polymers by wheat germ agglutinin, strongly suggests that secondary, non-specific interactions contribute to the binding of the lectin to the polymers.
