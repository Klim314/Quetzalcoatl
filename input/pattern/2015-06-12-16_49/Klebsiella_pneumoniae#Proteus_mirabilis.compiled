TI  - The complex epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance is a growing worldwide iatrogenic complication  of modern medical care. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have emerged as one of the most successful resistance mechanisms, limiting our therapeutic options to treat various human infections. The dissemination of these enzymes to the community probably signifies an irreversible step. This paper will review the evolution of human infections associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the past 20 years, and will present and discuss the current challenges, controversies, debates and knowledge gaps in this research field.
TI  - Susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in Jordan and Lebanon: SMART 2011-2013.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in medical centres of Jordan and Lebanon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. These isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. RESULTS: Among the 523 UTI-associated isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 IAI-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). Incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers among UTI-associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. Corresponding rates among IAI-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL produced. Seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The alarmingly high rates of ESBL production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.
TI  - Carriage rates and characteristics of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases in healthy individuals: comparison of applicants for long-term care and individuals screened for employment purposes.
AB  - AIMS: We compared the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the faecal samples of 1,109 healthy individuals screened for employment purposes and in 531 asymptomatic individuals applying for long-term care (LTC). METHODS: Eosin-methylene blue agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/l cefotaxime were used to determine which individuals were ESBL producers. ESBL phenotype was confirmed by double-disk synergy test and ESBL genes were identified by sequencing. ESBL producers were characterized by co-resistance and integron carriage. RESULTS: ESBL producers were more frequent in the LTC applicants than in the employment screening individuals (7.2 vs. 2.0%; p < 0.0001), with 43 Escherichia coli, 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca and 1 Proteus mirabilis being found. In the employment screening individuals, only E. coli was found. Most ESBL genes (79.4%, 50/63) were blaCTX-M type; blaCTX-M-15 was more frequent in the LTC applicants (p < 0.001). Regarding ESBL genes and integron diversity, E. coli isolates from the LTC applicants were more similar to K. pneumoniae than to E. coli from the employment screening individuals. CONCLUSION: These differences in the characteristics of ESBL producers may represent different sources of colonization. Most LTC applicants harboured K. pneumoniae or E. coli that were probably hospital-acquired whereas the E. coli isolates of many healthy individuals showed similarities to environmental E. coli.

TI  - Detection of bla KPC-2 in Proteus mirabilis in Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing isolates pose a major worldwide public health problem today. METHODS: A carbapenem-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate was investigated for plasmid profiles and the occurrence of beta-lactamase genes. RESULTS: The isolate exhibited resistance to ertapenem and imipenem and was susceptible to meropenem, polymyxin, and tigecycline. Five plasmids were identified in this isolate. DNA sequencing analysis revealed the presence of bla KPC-2 and bla TEM-1 genes. An additional PCR using plasmid DNA confirmed that bla KPC-2 was present in one of these plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: We report the detection of bla KPC-2 in P. mirabilis in Brazil for the first time. This finding highlights the continuous transfer of bla KPC between bacterial genera, which presents a serious challenge to the prevention of infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.
TI  - Ceftazidime-Avibactam Activity Tested against Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from U.S. Hospitals (2011 to 2013) and Characterization of beta-Lactamase-Producing Strains.
AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. This compound was active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype isolates. An ESBL phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 Escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 Klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 Proteus mirabilis (4.9%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. The most common enzymes detected among ESBL phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were CTX-M-15-like (n = 307), KPC (n = 120), SHV ESBLs (n = 118), and CTX-M-14-like (n = 110). KPC producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. Meropenem (MIC50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against CTX-M-producing isolates. Other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. Among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam MIC values of >8 mug/ml, three were K. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam MICs, >32 mug/ml), with two NDM-1 producers and one K. pneumoniae strain carrying the blaKPC-2 and blaVIM-4 genes. Therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing KPC enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. Resistance to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in UTI. A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from April 2011 to September 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting KIST Hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of UTI among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. Significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), Coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) (5.88%), Enterococcus spp (3.92%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), Proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and Proteus vulgaris (1.00%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Inhibition of quorum sensing mediated biofilm development and virulence in uropathogens by Hyptis suaveolens.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40 % of all hospital-acquired infections. The bacterial spectrum of nosocomial UTIs is broad and the treatment of UTIs is becoming difficult owing to the emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate novel and alternative therapeutic strategies to treat UTIs. Since UTIs are caused by uropathogens with quorum sensing (QS)-dependent biofilm forming abilities, interruption of QS systems may be a novel approach to combat drug resistance. In the present study, a methanol extract (and hexane extract derived from it) of the medicinal plant Hyptis suaveolens (L.) were shown to have anti-QS activity against the biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 12472). Furthermore, the hexane extract of H. suaveolens (HEHS) inhibited biofilm formation by uropathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. HEHS promotes the loosening of biofilm architecture and strongly inhibits in vitro biofilm formation by uropathogens, which was more apparent from microscopic images. In addition to this, HEHS reduces the production of QS-dependent virulence factors like protease and hemolysin, along with motility. The partial purification and GC-MS analysis of the active fraction revealed the presence of several therapeutically important compounds which may synergistically act on the uropathogens and possibly reduce the QS-dependent phenotypes. These findings suggest HEHS as potential phytotherapeutic agent which can be employed to formulate protective strategies against biofilm linked infections caused by uropathogens.
TI  - Epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of infections in hospitals around the world, which is very difficult to control and treat. It is particularly prevalent in intensive care wards. AIM: The main objective of the research was to establish the application of epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by A. baumannii in order to determine: the type and distribution of NIs, and to investigate antimicrobial drug resistance of A. baumannii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 855 patients treated at the Clinic of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University Clinical Center Tuzla during 2013 were followed prospectively for the development of NIs. Infections caused by A. baumannii were characterized by the anatomical site and antibiotics resistance profile. RESULTS: NIs were registered in 105 patients (12.3%; 855/105). The predominant cause of infection was A. baumannii with an incidence of 51.4% (54/105), followed by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae with 15.2% (16/105) of cases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with 8.6% (9/105), and ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis with 7.6% (8/105). According to the anatomical site, and type of NIs caused by A. baumannii, the most frequent were respiratory infections (74.1%; 40/54). Infections of surgical sites were registered in 11.1% (6/54) of cases, while bloodstream infections in 9.2% (5/54). A. baumannii isolates tested resistant against most antibiotics examined, but showed a high degree of susceptibility to tobramycin (87%; 47/54) and colistin (100%; 54/54). CONCLUSION: The increasing incidence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the importance of administration of an adequate antibiotic strategy and the implementation of strict monitoring of the measures for controlling nosocomial infections.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - High prevalence of CTX-M-15 and first report of CTX-M-3, CTX-M-22, CTX-M-28 and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in hospital and community settings.
AB  - AIM: To investigate molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/ESBL and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase/pAmpC producing Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the period Decembar 2009-May 2010. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion and broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Double-disk synergy test was performed in order to screen for ESBLs/pAmpC beta-lactamases. PCR was used to detect bla(ESBL)/bla(ampC)/bla(carb) genes. Genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Among 85 patients with UTIs caused by ESBL producing isolates, 44 (51.8%) were from in-patients and 41 (48.2%) from outpatients. Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated from in-patients, in 28 (63.6%) cases. Among outpatients, Klebsiella spp./Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated, in 19 (46.3%)/16 (39.0%) cases. Twenty-one (75.0%) from hospital and nine (47.4%) from outpatient Klebsiella spp. isolates were positive for blaTEM, whereas 27 (96.4%) from in-patients and 6 (31.6%) from outpatient were bla(CTX-M) positive (18 hospital and five outpatient isolates were encoding bla(CTX-M-15)). One Klebsiella oxytoca and one Enterobacter cloacae inpatient isolates were positive for blaCTX-M-28. One Klebsiella pneumoniae outpatient isolate were positive for bla(CTX-M-22) and one E. coli for bla(CTX-M-3). One hospital Proteus mirabilis strain was positive for bla(CMY-2) and two Klebsiella spp. strains for blaDHA-1, whereas two E. coli, one K. oxytoca and one Proteus vulgaris outpatient strains were positive for bla(CMY-2). CONCLUSION: Identification of bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-22) and bla(CTX-M-28) among Enterobacteriaceae is uncommon. In this study we report the emergency of CMY-2 and DHA-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria Species Isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches are among the medically important pests found within the  human habitations that cause serious public health problems. They may harbor a number of pathogenic bacteria on the external surface with antibiotic resistance. Hence, they are regarded as major microbial vectors. This study investigates the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria species isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India. METHODS: Totally, 203 adult cockroaches were collected form 44 households and 52 food-handling establishments by trapping. Bacteriological examination of external surfaces of Pe. americana and Bl. germanica were carried out using standard method and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of the isolates were determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Among the places, we found that 54% had cockroache infestation in households and 77% in food- handling establishments. There was no significant different between the overall bacteria load of the external surface in Pe. americana (64.04%) and Bl. germanica (35.96%). However the predominant bacteria on cockroaches were Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were the most prevalent, drug-resistant strains were isolated from the cockroaches with 100% resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin. For individual strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli was found to have multi-resistance to four antibiotic tested, Citrobacter freundii four, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis to three. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches are uniformly distributed in domestic environment, which can be a possible vector for transmission of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne diseases.
TI  - Identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  - Chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. It is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. A number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. The isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Proteus mirabilis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), group G beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). In comparison to the other isolates, P. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by S. aureus, with insignificant differences between MRSA and non-methicillin resistant isolates. The Enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. The isolation of MRSA, ESBL-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. This study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. However, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and comparators against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in China.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 401 ESBL-producing isolates, including 196 Escherichia coli, 124 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 81 Proteus mirabilis, were collected consecutively from 21 hospitals in China in 2013. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. Phenotypic identification of ESBL production was detected as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). ESBL genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. Flomoxef, doripenem, meropenem, ertapenem, cefmetazole and piperacillin/tazobactam exhibited good activity against ESBL-producing isolates, with susceptibility rates >90%. Tigecycline showed good activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae (100% and 97.6%, respectively). Cefotaxime and cefepime showed very low activities against ESBL-producing isolates, with susceptibility rates of 0-0.8% and 1.0-13.6%, respectively. blaCTX-M were the major ESBL genes, with occurrence in 99.5% of E. coli, 91.1% of K. pneumoniae and 97.5% of P. mirabilis. blaCTX-M-14 was the predominant ESBL gene, detected in 46.9% (188/401) of the isolates, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (21.4%), blaCTX-M-55 (17.2%), blaCTX-M-65 (12.7%) and blaCTX-M-3 (6.7%). Flomoxef exhibited excellent activity against the different CTX-M-type ESBL-producing isolates, with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.064-0.125mug/mL and 0.25-0.5mug/mL, respectively. Against the isolates solely producing CTX-M-14, -15, -55, -3 or -65, flomoxef showed susceptibility rates of 98.6%, 98.0%, 98.1%, 100.0% and 97.4%, respectively. In conclusion, flomoxef showed good activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and may be a choice to treat infections caused by these isolates in China.
TI  - Detection of blaCTX-M-type genes in complex class 1 integrons carried by Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat in Brazil.
AB  - CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been increasingly identified in humans and animals, and their potential transmission by contaminated food has been highlighted. In this study, we report for the first time the isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains harboring blaCTXM-2 or blaCTXM-8 gene variants in chicken meat sold in markets in southeast Brazil. In this regard, the genetic environment of the blaCTX-M-2 gene is composed of a complex class 1 integron and an ISCR1-associated sequence with dfr and/or aadA gene cassettes located within the variable region. In summary, chicken meat may be a reservoir of MDR Enterobacteriaceae harboring blaCTX-M-type genes, which is a public health concern.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of well waters in Samaru, Zaria, Kaduna, State, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Majority of the human population in semi-urban and urban areas in Nigeria are heavily reliant on well water as the main source of water supply for drinking and domestic use due to inadequate provision of potable pipe borne water. These groundwater sources can easily be fecally contaminated and thus, increase the incidence and outbreaks of preventable waterborne diseases. This study was carried out to determine the bacteriological quality of some well waters in Samaru, Z. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samaru, Zaria located in Northern Nigeria, is a semi-urban university satellite town blessed with abundant ground and surface water. Five sampling sites were randomly selected for this study. A total of 10 samples: Two from each of the sites were collected fortnightly for 1 month (May-June, 2013). Samples were analyzed using presumptive multiple tube fermentation and confirmatory tests for total and fecal coliforms. The well water samples were also cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio chole. RESULTS: The total coliform count for all the samples analyzed was >180+/100 ml. All the well water samples from the study locations were contaminated with one or more bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli 20%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 100% and Proteus mirabilis 40%. Salmonella, Shigella, or V. cholerae were not isolated from any of the well water samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study showed contamination of all the wells studied with fecal coliforms thus, indicating the possible presence of other enteric pathogens and a potential source for waterborne disease outbreaks. Well water in Samaru is not safe for drinking without additional treatment like disinfection or boiling. Periodic testing and constant monitoring of well waters should also be done to meet up with the World Health Organization Standards in the provision of safe, clean drinking water .
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - Preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  - Biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. Due to the polyurethane structure features and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. A series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (PUFs) was synthesized with polyethers (MM 2500-5000), polyesters MM (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. Different functional compounds: 1,4-di-N-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (DOMQ), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-N,N-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. Structural peculiarities of PUFs were studied by FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray scattering. Self-adhesion properties of PUFs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. The optical microscopy method was performed for the PUF morphology studies. Toxicological estimation of the PUFs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. The antibacterial action towards the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATC 25922, E. coli ATC 2150, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, Staphylococcus aureus 180, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, Proteus mirabilis F 403, P. mirabilis 6054, and Proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. Physic-chemical properties of the PUFs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied PUFs are within the operational requirements for such materials and represent fine-cellular foams. Spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of DOMQ into the PUF's macrochain. PUFs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. They are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.
TI  - Enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in  a Port Complex.
AB  - The Port Complex of Maranhao (PCM) is the second largest port complex in Brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. To evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (pH and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains were analyzed. In order to identify the presence of E. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggR, CVD432, ipaH and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. The presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. Analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. We identified the species Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Edwardsiella tarda. Out of the 51 E. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive for the CVD432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. This study reveals that the PCM is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic E.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of Maranhao.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - beta-lactamases produced by amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant enterobacteria isolated in Buenos Aires, Argentina: a new blaTEM gene.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors in enterobacteria is a growing problem that has not been intensively studied in Argentina. In the present work, 54/843 enterobacteria collected in a teaching hospital of Buenos Aires city were ampicillin-sulbactam-resistant isolates remaining susceptible to second- and third-generation cephalosporins. The enzymatic mechanisms present in the isolates, which were also amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC)-resistant (18/54) were herein analyzed. Sequencing revealed two different variants of blaTEM-1, being blaTEM-1b the most frequently detected allelle (10 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Raoultella terrigena) followed by blaTEM-1a (1 K. pneumoniae). Amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance seems to be mainly associated with TEM-1 overproduction (mostly in E. coli) or co-expressed with OXA-2-like and/or SHV beta-lactamases (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis). A new blaTEM variant (TEM-163) was described in an E. coli strain having an AMC MIC value of 16/8mug/ml. TEM-163 contains Arg275Gln and His289Leu amino acid substitutions. On the basis of the high specific activity and low IC50 for clavulanic acid observed, the resistance pattern seems to be due to overproduction of the new variant of broad spectrum beta-lactamase rather than to an inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-like behavior.
TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria Escherichia coli are live biotherapeutics for UTI.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for approximately 8 million clinic visits  annually with symptoms that include acute pelvic pain, dysuria, and irritative voiding. Empiric UTI management with antimicrobials is complicated by increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, but live biotherapeutics products (LBPs), such as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) strains of E. coli, offer the potential to circumvent antimicrobial resistance. Here we evaluated ASB E. coli as LBPs, relative to ciprofloxacin, for efficacy against infection and visceral pain in a murine UTI model. Visceral pain was quantified as tactile allodynia of the pelvic region in response to mechanical stimulation with von Frey filaments. Whereas ciprofloxacin promoted clearance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), it did not reduce pelvic tactile allodynia, a measure of visceral pain. In contrast, ASB E. coli administered intravesically or intravaginally provided comparable reduction of allodynia similar to intravesical lidocaine. Moreover, ASB E. coli were similarly effective against UTI allodynia induced by Proteus mirabilis, Enterococccus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Therefore, ASB E. coli have anti-infective activity comparable to the current standard of care yet also provide superior analgesia. These studies suggest that ASB E. coli represent novel LBPs for UTI symptoms.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of selected medicinal plants against multidrug resistant bacterial strains from clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of Curcuma longa (C. longa), Zingiber officinale (Z. officinale) and Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis of clinical origin. METHODS: The antimicrobial efficacy of said medicinal plants and establishment of multidrug resistant character of these bacteria were carried out using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. RESULTS: The results of MIC and MBC showed that these clinical bacterial isolates were phenotypically multidrug resistant against standard antibiotics (>500 mug/mL). Compared to standard antibiotics, C. longa, Z. officinale and T. cordifolia were more effective in killing these microbes as evident from MIC and MBC values (5 to 125 mug/mL). Moreover, C. longa had highest antibacterial efficacy compared to Z. officinale and T. cordifolia. CONCLUSIONS: The result thus obtained suggests that bioactive principles of these plants can be used particularly against these multidrug resistant bacteria of clinical origin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Mentha longifolia L. and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from Mentha longifolia L. (M. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. (Z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of M. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. RESULTS: The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) were observed by the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - Epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae producing CTX-M type extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).
AB  - Over the past 20 years, some Enterobacteriaceae mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis have demonstrated acquisition of plasmids secreting ESBL. CTX-M type ESBL have been isolated worldwide and their incidence has increased dramatically and is still increasing leading to a major therapeutic issue. Currently more than 150 allelic variants of CTX-M have been identified. These enzymes are classified in five major phylogenetic groups based on their gene sequences: CTX-M -1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-25; two additional groups have been reported recently: CTX-M-74 and CTX-M-75. The important dissemination of these enzymes has led to an increased use of carbapenems. Their global community and nosocomial dissemination is often associated with a virulent E. coli clone ST131 producing CTX-M-15.
TI  - [Phenotypic detection of beta-lactamases production in Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibacterial drugs. However, many bacteria have developed resistance to these antibiotics, and the most common form of resistance is the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. Many members of the Enterobacteriaceae family produce different types of these enzymes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamase type in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from different clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in the Clinical Center of Serbia. METHODS: The strains of Enterobacteriaceae were collected between November 2011 and January 2012 in the laboratory of the Clinical Center of Serbia.The isolates were identified according to the standard microbiology procedures and confirmed by the Vitek2 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method, and the phenotypic detection of production and identification of beta-lactamases was performed according to previously described methodologies. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 172 Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated. Further testing was performed on 54/145 (37.2%) strains showing decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics: 13/85 (15.3%) Escherichia coli, 31/46 (67.4%) Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10/14 (71.4%) Proteus mirabilis. Among them, 40/145 (27.6%) strains produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), 9/145 (6.2%)--AmpC, 1/145 (0.7%)--K1 beta-lactamase and 4/145 (2.8%)--carbapenemases. Carbapenemases were predominantly detected in K. pneumoniae (75%). CONCLUSION: Enterobacteriaceae produce different types of beta-lactamases, and the most common type in our study was ESBLs. Production of carbapenemases detected in Enterobacteriaceae is also an associated problem.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Expansion of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (ST15, ST147, ST336) and epidemic plasmids (IncR, IncFIIK).
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates other than E. coli from Portuguese hospitals. Eighty-eight ESBL-producing clinical isolates (69 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 Enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Enterobacter asburiae, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the North (A) or Centre (B, C) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. Standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, ESBL characterization, clonal (PFGE, MLST) and plasmid (S1-PFGE, I-CeuI-PFGE, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. Isolates produced mostly CTX-M-15 (47%) or SHV-12 (30%), and less frequently other SHV- (15%; SHV-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or TEM- (9%; TEM-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. The increase of CTX-M-15 and diverse SHV ESBL-types observed in Hospital A was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae epidemic clones (ST15, ST147, ST336). SHV-12 and TEM-type ESBLs were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different Enterobacteriaceae species in Hospitals B and C in 2006-7. Particular plasmid types were linked to blaCTX-M-15 (IncR or non-typeable plasmids), blaSHV-12 (IncR or IncHI2), blaSHV-28/-55/-106 (IncFIIK1 or IncFIIK5), blaTEM-10 (IncL/M) or blaTEM-24 (IncA/C), mostly in epidemic clones. In our country, the amplification of CTX-M-15 and diverse SHV-type ESBL among non-E. coli Enterobacteriaceae is linked to international MDR K. pneumoniae clones (ST15, ST147, ST336) and plasmid types (IncR, IncFIIK). Furthermore, we highlight the potential of IncFIIK plasmids (here firstly associated with blaSHV-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship studies of microbiologically active thiosemicarbazides derived from hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazides.
AB  - Forty-five derivatives of thiosemicarbazide were synthesized, and their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. Some of the described compounds exhibited interesting activity against reference strains of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas only two derivatives had the ability to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative species (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12453). The most potent antimicrobial activity was observed in the cases of salicylic acid hydrazide derivatives. The differences in activity inspired us to conduct conformational analysis using molecular mechanics level. The obtained results suggest that the molecule geometry, especially at the N4-terminus of thiosemicarbazide skeleton, determines the antibacterial activity. Unfortunately, in opposition to what we expected, only one of the tested compounds inhibited the activity of the topoIV enzyme, and none of them was active against DNA gyrase.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. An important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. This study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the University Hospital Olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. METHODS: For the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011, resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. For the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (DDDatb) based on the ATC/DDD classification and in relative annual consumption (RDDDatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. The relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using Spearman's correlation. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 113,027 isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. There was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and amikacin in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Also, there was significant correlation between resistance to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. No relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.
TI  - Role of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  - Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. Recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (rUTI) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. For patients, rUTI is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment of rUTI is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. Repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase of resistance of uropathogenic strains. According to the European Association of Urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". Our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention of rUTI. Total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our open-label post-marketing trial. Each patient had more than one year history of rUTI and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. The trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R) together with the standard antibacterial medication. According to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by Escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. Each woman was involved as the intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. The women received only vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R). 65 patients of the control group had more than one year history of rUTI and had been treated earlier, too. Patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without Solco-Urovac(R). After therapy and follow-up examination, results in the both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. During the follow-up period no case of rUTI was noticed in women. In total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of rUTI in 46 patients during the follow-up period. Altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. Through comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of rUTI episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of Solco-Urovac(R). The results of our post-marketing trial allow recommending Solco-Urovac(R) for appropriate reference within the Georgian National Guideline on Urologic Infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in China: SMART China 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in patients worldwide. METHODS: In 2011, 1 929 aerobic and facultative GNBs from 21 hospitals in 16 cities in China were collected. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility was determined following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Among the Gram-negative pathogens causing IAIs, Escherichia coli (47.3%) was the most commonly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (8.3%). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 78.8% (1521/1929) of the total isolates. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, ertapenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 95.1% and 94.4%, followed by amikacin (93.9%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (87.7%). Susceptibility rates of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae were 38.3%, 38.3%, 61.1%, and 50.8%, respectively. The leastactive agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (25.9%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis were 68.8%, 38.1%, 41.2%, and 57.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and the most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Including the carbapenems, most agents exhibited reduced susceptibility against ESBL-positive and multidrug-resistant isolates.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in pregnant  women. Pregnancy enhances the progression from ASB to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, UTIs and higher foetal mortality rates. AIM: To identify the prevalence of ASB, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at Kanpur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for ASB by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. RESULTS: In this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). Growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). Among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. Highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. The predominant organisms which were isolated were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. Hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: Routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in Vietnam: report from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART 2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. Limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from Vietnam. This study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in Vietnam during 2009-2011. A total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. Among the species collected, Escherichia coli (48.1% ESBL-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% ESBL-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. Ertapenem MIC90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/mL and remained unchanged for ESBL-positive isolates. Imipenem MIC90 values were also the same for all isolates and ESBL-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/mL, respectively. Ertapenem MIC90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/mL, respectively. Analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that CTX-M variants, particularly CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-15, were the predominant enzymes. High resistance rates in Vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout Asia and globally.
TI  - New mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes based on the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate and bioactive nitrogen-donor ligands. Synthesis, structure and biological properties.
AB  - Starting from the precursor [Zinc Valproate complex] (1), new mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes of valproic acid and nitrogen-based ligands, formulating as, [Zn(valp)22,9-dmphen] (2), [Zn2(valp)4(quin)2] (3), [Zn(valp)2(2-ampy)2] (4), and [Zn(valp)2(2-ampic)2] (5) (valp = valproate, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, quin = quinoline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, 2-ampic = 2-amino-6-picoline) were synthesized and characterized using IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR and UV-Vis spectrometry. The crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 4 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexes were also evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity using in-vitro agar diffusion method against three Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) species. Complex 2 showed considerable activity against all tested microorganisms and the effect of complexation on the anti-bacterial activity of the parent ligand of 2 was also investigated. The anti-bacterial activity of 2,9-dmphen against Gram-negative bacteria was enhanced upon complexation with zinc valproate. On the other hand, complexes 1 and 3 showed weak inhibition activity against the tested species and complexes 4 and 5 didn't show any activity at all. Two methods were used for testing the inhibition of ferriprotoporphyrinIX bio-mineralization: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment which considered being the target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodiaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 2 in preventing the formation of beta-Hematin was 80%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 91%.
TI  - A survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (BHR) IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern China. METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids was developed and used to determine these BHR plasmids. The difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and non-MDRO were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: The average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for IncN, IncP, IncQ, IncW, and IncA/C in descending order. The distribution of all five BHR plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. The prevalence rates of all five BHR plasmids in MDROs were significantly higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). CONCLUSIONS: BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. The prevalence rates in MDRO are higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for NFGNB.
TI  - Antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five Gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. METHODS: The correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. RESULTS: Among these five bacteria, overall E. coli and K. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, P. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. In contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. K. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in P. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. P. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas A. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. CONCLUSION: The development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.
TI  - In vitro studies of epithelium-associated crystallization caused by uropathogens  during urinary calculi development.
AB  - Infectious urinary stones account for about 10% of all urinary stones. In 50% of  cases urolithiasis is a recurrent illness, which can lead to the loss of a kidney if not properly treated. One of the reasons for recurrence of the disease may be the ability of bacteria to invade urothelial cells, persist in the host cells and serve as potential reservoirs for infection. Various uropathogens are associated with the formation of bacteria-induced urinary stones but Proteus mirabilis is the most commonly isolated (70%). An in vitro model was used in this study to analyze intracellular growth and crystallization in the presence of P. mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Human ureter (Hu 609) and bladder (HCV 29) epithelial cell lines were infected with bacteria and incubated (3-72 h) in the presence of synthetic urine and amikacin to prevent extracellular bacterial growth. During the incubation the number of bacteria (CFU/ml) inside epithelial cells and the intensity of crystallization were established. Crystallization was determined as an amount of a calcium radioisotope. The chosen strains of uropathogens were able to invade both types of epithelial cells but the Hu 609 cells were invaded to a higher extent. However, crystallization occurred only in the presence of P. mirabilis strains which were invasive and urease-positive. The highest intensity of cell-associated crystallization was observed when the number of bacteria within the urothelium remained stable during the time of incubation. These results show that P. mirabilis has an ability to form crystals inside the host cells. Under these conditions bacteria are protected from antibiotic killing, which leads to persistent and recurrent infections. We also suspect that this phenomenon may be an important stage of kidney stones formation.
TI  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic Gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in European and United States hospitals (2012).
AB  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAI), complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing IAI and healthcare-associated UTI (HCA-UTI). The organisms were consecutively collected from January to December 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the United States (USA) and 15 European countries by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS). The collection included 809 organisms from IAI and 2474 organisms from HCA-UTI, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M07-A9 document. Overall, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against E. coli (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (MDR; MIC50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/L) and ESBL-phenotype strains (MIC50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/L). Ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most K. pneumoniae strains (MIC50/90, 0.25/16 mg/L, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L), but some ESBL-phenotype (MIC50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/L) and MDR (MIC50/90, 16/>32 mg/L) isolates exhibited elevated MIC values. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mg/L; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/L) and retained potency against many MDR (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2/>32 mg/L) strains. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), Enterobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/L), Citrobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/L), Proteus mirabilis (MIC50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/L), indole-positive Proteae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), and Serratia spp. (MIC50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/L). In summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic Gram-negative pathogens causing IAI and HCA-UTI in USA and European medical centers.
TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (NIs) than other departments. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of NIs in the surgical ICU at University Clinical Center Tuzla. METHODS: All patients admitted to the surgical ICU were followed prospectively, for the development of NIs (January-December 2010). Determination of NIs was performed using standardized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed NIs. Respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. Other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. Gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (16%), and Clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of NIs. ICU patients are more susceptible to NIs, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.
TI  - Functional identification of Proteus mirabilis eptC gene encoding a core lipopolysaccharide phosphoethanolamine transferase.
AB  - By comparison of the Proteus mirabilis HI4320 genome with known lipopolysaccharide (LPS) phosphoethanolamine transferases, three putative candidates (PMI3040, PMI3576, and PMI3104) were identified. One of them, eptC (PMI3104) was able to modify the LPS of two defined non-polar core LPS mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae that we use as surrogate substrates. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance showed that eptC directs the incorporation of phosphoethanolamine to the O-6 of L-glycero-D-mano-heptose II. The eptC gene is found in all the P. mirabilis strains analyzed in this study. Putative eptC homologues were found for only two additional genera of the Enterobacteriaceae family, Photobacterium and Providencia. The data obtained in this work supports the role of the eptC (PMI3104) product in the transfer of PEtN to the O-6 of L,D-HepII in P. mirabilis strains.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae in a Saudi Arabian tertiary hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis). In addition, different methods for detection of these enzymes, including the newly introduced CHROMagar ESBL, were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: A total of 382 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were obtained from King Fahad Specialist Hospital - Dammam, during 2011 and screened for production of ESBL using advanced expert system of Vitek 2, CHROMagar and ESBL-E-strips. PCR assay was used to detect blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M genes. Susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was determined. RESULTS: The overall proportion of ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates was 30.6%, which was higher in E. coli (35.8%) than in K. pneumoniae (25.7%). ESBL genotypes showed remarkable increase in the CTX-M (97.4%) compared to SHV (23.1%). The predominant ESBL was CTX-M- 15 (92.1 %). No TEM ESBL was detected in this study. The Vitek2 showed the highest sensitivity (100%), and the CHROMagar had the lowest specificity (97.3%) compared to the molecular method. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high level of blaCTX-M positive ESBL isolates are circulating in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The trend of a multidrug-resistant profile associated with the recovery of the blaCTX-M gene is alarming.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact  of patient risk factors on susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from January 1 to December 31, 2012. A urinary antibiogram specific for Escherichia coli (EC), Proteus mirabilis (PM), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was developed. Urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities were compared. Urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: There were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. Overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (KP, 14% vs 7% [P = .001]; EC, 13% vs 9% [P < .001]; PM, 18% vs 10% [P = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. Health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for EC and PM. CONCLUSIONS: Using a syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.
TI  - blaKPC gene Detection in Clinical Isolates of Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, especially in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, is an emerging problem worldwide. A common mechanism of carbapenem resistance is the production of class-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The present study focused on determining the antibiotic resistance pattern and prevalence of bla KPC gene coding for KPC in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. METHODOLOGY: Forty six carbapenem resistant isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested for antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Modified Hodge Test (MHT) and PCR for bla KPC gene detection were performed on these isolates. Of these, 22 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 21 were Escherichia coli, 2 were Citrobacter species and 1 was Proteus mirabilis Results: Forty three (93.4%) out of the 46 isolates were resistant to Meropenem, 34 (73.9%) were resistant to Imipenem and 30 (65.2%) were resistant to both Imipenem and Meropenem. Modified Hodge Test was positive in 38 (82.6%) out of 46 isolates and blaKPC gene was detected in 31 (67.4%) isolates. bla KPC gene was detected in 28 out of the 38 MHT positive isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the CANWARD study, 2011-2012.
AB  - Plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. The in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between January 2011 and October 2012. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method, with MICs interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints, when available. Plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with all species except Proteus mirabilis having an MIC90 of </=1 mug/ml. Plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible Escherichia coli, with MIC50 and MIC90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. Furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an MIC of </=1 mug/ml. The MIC50 and MIC90 values for plazomicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. Plazomicin had an MIC50 of 8 mug/ml and an MIC90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with both having MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. In summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. These data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
TI  - Therapeutic challenges of ESBLS and AmpC beta-lactamase producers in a tertiary care center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to broad-spectrum beta lactams mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta lactamases (AmpC betaLs) enzymes is an increasing problem worldwide. Determination of their prevalence is essential to formulate an effective antibiotic policy and hospital infection control measures. Present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL and AmpC betaL producers in ICU of a tertiary care center. METHODS: A total of 262 clinical isolates comprising of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis that were recovered from various clinical specimens over a one year period, were studied. Antibiogram profile was determined to conventionally used antibiotics, along with recommended tests for detection of ESBL and AmpC betaL production. RESULTS: 40.07% (105/262) were found to be ESBL producers, 14.8% (39/262) were AmpC bL producers. The coexistence of ESBL and AmpC betaL producers was detected in 9.9% (26/262) of the isolates. CONCLUSION: Screening of multidrug resistant bacteria especially belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae poses considerable therapeutic challenges in critical care patients because of the production of ESBL and AmpC betaL. Strategies to keep a check on the emergence of such drug resistant microbes by hospital environmental surveillance and laboratory monitoring should form an important aspect of Hospital Infection control policy guidelines.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in Zagreb.
AB  - AIM: Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. Results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents against Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates collected at pediatric intensive care units of the University Hospital Center Zagreb in Croatia were reported. METHODS: A total of 110 Gram-negative and 43 Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. The minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI. RESULTS: There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant Gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. However, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria after 2008.
TI  - Recommendations for the empirical treatment of complicated urinary tract infections using surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infections (c-UTIs) are among the most common nosocomial infections and a substantial part of the antimicrobial agents used in hospitals is for the treatment of c-UTIs. Data from surveillance can be used to guide the empirical treatment choices of clinicians when treating c-UTIs. We therefore used nation-wide surveillance data to evaluate antimicrobial coverage of agents for the treatment of c-UTI in the Netherlands. METHODS: We included the first isolate per patient of urine samples of hospitalised patients collected by the Infectious Disease Surveillance Information System for Antibiotic Resistance (ISIS-AR) in 2012, and determined the probability of inadequate coverage for antimicrobial agents based on species distribution and susceptibility. Analyses were repeated for various patient groups and hospital settings. RESULTS: The most prevalent bacteria in 27,922 isolates of 23,357 patients were Escherichia coli (47%), Enterococcus spp. (14%), Proteus mirabilis (8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). For all species combined, the probability of inadequate coverage was <5% for amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combined with gentamicin and the carbapenems. When including gram-negative bacteria only, the probability of inadequate coverage was 4.0%, 2.7%, 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively, for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a second or a third generation cephalosporin in combination with gentamicin, and the carbapenems (0.4%). There were only small variations in results among different patient groups and hospital settings. CONCLUSIONS: When excluding Enterococcus spp., considered as less virulent, and the carbapenems, considered as last-resort drugs, empirical treatment for c-UTI with the best chance of adequate coverage are one of the studied beta-lactam-gentamicin combinations. This study demonstrates the applicability of routine surveillance data for up-to-date clinical practice guidelines on empirical antimicrobial therapy, essential in patient care given the evolving bacterial susceptibility.
TI  - Evaluation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute phenotypic confirmatory test to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from 4005 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis isolates.
AB  - A subset of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected for the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends that were positive for the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypic confirmatory test (n = 3245) or had an ertapenem MIC of >/=0.5 microg ml(-1) (n = 293), or both (n = 467), were analysed for ESBL genes. Most ESBL phenotype E. coli or K. pneumoniae possessed an ESBL gene (95.8 and 88.4 %, respectively), and this was 93.1 % if carbapenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were removed. This rate was lower for P. mirabilis (73.4 %) and K. oxytoca (62.5 %). Virtually all ESBL-positive isolates (99.5 %) were cefotaxime non-susceptible [CLSI or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints)]. Fewer isolates (82 %) were ceftazidime non-susceptible (CLSI breakpoints). In addition, 21.1 % of E. coli, 25 % of K. oxytoca and 78.7 % of P. mirabilis isolates were ceftazidime susceptible but ESBL positive. This suggests that CLSI breakpoints for ceftazidime are too high to detect ESBLs. The lower EUCAST breakpoints detected ESBLs in E. coli and K. oxytoca better, but 59.6 % of ESBL-positive isolates of P. mirabilis were ceftazidime susceptible. For isolates with ertapenem MICs >/=0.5 microg ml(-1), more accurate ESBL phenotype analysis was observed for E. coli and K. pneumoniae (sensitivity >95 % for both, specificity 94.4 and 54.1 %, respectively). If carbapenemase-positive K. pneumoniae were excluded, the specificity increased to 78 %. The positive predictive values for the ESBL phenotypic test with E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 97.6 and 81.8 %, respectively, and negative predictive values were 75.9 and 95.2 %, respectively. We therefore suggest that it would be prudent to confirm phenotypic ESBL-positive P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca with molecular analysis.
TI  - Diafiltration MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry method for culture-independent detection and identification of pathogens directly from urine specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the aim of rapid, culture-independent identification of microorganisms directly from urine specimens, we developed a diafiltration matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method. METHODS: In this procedure, urine specimens are desalted, fractionated, and concentrated prior to MS analysis. The analytic performance characteristics of the diafiltration method were assessed in a prospective trial whereby 100 fresh urine specimens were processed using diafiltration MALDI-TOF MS. Concomitant with this, conventional culture was performed with results blinded to the MS operator. RESULTS: The diafiltration method correctly identified urine specimens positive for uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) and correctly classified all specimens negative for clinically relevant bacteriuria, including a subset of contaminated urine specimens and a subset with growth of clinically insignificant flora. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 67% and 100%, respectively. The detection limit of this method was 10(5) to 10(6) colony-forming units/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Using the diafiltration method, we were able to improve the turnaround time for microorganism identification from 24 to 48 hours (for conventional culture) to 2 to 3 hours. Although methodological refinements are under way to further improve the clinical sensitivity and turnaround time, the 100% positive predictive value of this method suggests that it could be used to guide the selection of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriostatic potency of expired oral paediatric antibiotics and implications on infant health.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In spite of significant risks, as well as non-clinical importance due to loss of potency, stiff penalties against administration of expired medications are still not appropriately enforced by health policy makers in many developing countries, possibly because of little evidence to support that expired medications are hazardous. The purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of expiration dates on in vitro bacteriostatic potentials of oral paediatric antibiotics. METHODS: Comparative bacteriostatic potentials of 31 expired and seven corresponding unexpired oral paediatric antibiotics were determined on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria, using a modification of agar well-diffusion method. RESULTS: Verall total percentage in vitro resistance rates against expired and unexpired paediatric antibiotics respectively were - E. coli (</=100% vs. </=15.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (</=100% vs. </=31.3%), Proteus mirabilis (</=91.7% vs. </=41.7%) and Staphylococcus aureus (</=100% vs. </=18.2%). Resistance rates of 45.5-55.8% (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim 5), 39.5-63.6% (amoxycillin 6), 46.5-54.5% (cotrimoxazole 7), 37.5-63.6% (ampicillin + cloxacillin 18), and higher resistance rates of >/=75.0-100% were exhibited towards remaining expired antibiotics. Higher total resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) rates were also recorded against expired antibiotics (45.2-93.5%) compared to unexpired antibiotics (28.6-57.2%), except for few strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. Furthermore, unexpired paediatric antibiotics exhibited wider zones of inhibition towards the test diarrhoeagenic bacteria (>/=25.0 mm diameter). CONCLUSION: This study provided preliminary microbiological results on the appreciable reduction in in vitro bacteriostatic potentials, as well as higher resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance rates among expired oral paediatric antibiotics on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria. Apart from less-efficacy, administration of expired antibiotics can lead to increased antibiotic resistance and clinical treatment failure, as well as adverse drug reactions.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Inactivation of Gram-Negative Bacteria by Low-Pressure RF Remote Plasma Excited in N2-O2 Mixture and SF6 Gases.
AB  - The role of low-pressure RF plasma in the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157,  Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter sakazakii using N2-O2 and SF6 gases was assessed. 1x10(9) colony-forming units (CFUs) of each bacterial isolate were placed on three polymer foils. The effects of pressure, power, distance from the source, and exposure time to plasma gases were optimized. The best conditions to inactivate the four bacteria were a 91%N2-9%O2 mixture and a 30-minute exposure time. SF6 gas was more efficient for all the tested isolates in as much as the treatment time was reduced to only three minutes. Therefore, low-pressure plasma could be used to sterilize heat and/or moisture-sensitive medical instruments.
TI  - Contemporary diversity of beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae in the nine U.S. census regions and ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against isolates producing the most prevalent beta-lactamase groups.
AB  - Escherichia coli (328 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (296), Klebsiella oxytoca  (44), and Proteus mirabilis (33) isolates collected during 2012 from the nine U.S. census regions and displaying extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were evaluated for the presence of beta-lactamase genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were analyzed. The highest ESBL rates were noted for K. pneumoniae (16.0%, versus 4.8 to 11.9% for the other species) and in the Mid-Atlantic and West South Central census regions. CTX-M group 1 (including CTX-M-15) was detected in 303 strains and was widespread throughout the United States but was more prevalent in the West South Central, Mid-Atlantic, and East North Central regions. KPC producers (118 strains [112 K. pneumoniae strains]) were detected in all regions and were most frequent in the Mid-Atlantic region (58 strains). Thirteen KPC producers also carried blaCTX-M. SHV genes encoding ESBL activity were detected among 176 isolates. Other beta-lactamase genes observed were CTX-M group 9 (72 isolates), FOX (10), TEM ESBL (9), DHA (7), CTX-M group 2 (3), NDM-1 (2 [Colorado]), and CTX-M groups 8 and 25 (1). Additionally, 62.9% of isolates carried >/=2 beta-lactamase genes. KPC producers were highly resistant to multiple agents, but ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml) were the most active agents tested. Overall, meropenem (MIC50, </=0.06 mug/ml), ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50, 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml), and tigecycline (MIC50, 0.12 to 2 mug/ml) were the most active antimicrobials when tested against this collection. NDM-1 producers were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. The diversity and increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been documented, and ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against the vast majority of beta-lactamase-producing strains isolated from U.S. hospitals.
TI  - Urinary concentrations and antibacterial activities of nitroxoline at 250 milligrams versus trimethoprim at 200 milligrams against uropathogens in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Because of the increasing bacterial resistance of uropathogens against standard antibiotics, such as trimethoprim (TMP), older antimicrobial drugs, such as nitroxoline (NTX), should be reevaluated. This randomized crossover study investigated the urinary concentrations of parent drugs and their metabolites and their antibacterial activities (urinary inhibitory titers [UITs] and urinary bactericidal titers [UBTs]) against uropathogens at three different urinary pH values within 24 h in six healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of NTX at 250 mg versus TMP at 200 mg. In three additional volunteers, urinary bactericidal kinetics (UBK) were studied after oral administration of NTX at 250 mg three times a day. The mean urinary concentrations of NTX and NTX sulfate in 24 h were 0.012 to 0.507 mg/liter and 0.28 to 27.83 mg/liter, respectively. The mean urinary concentrations of TMP were 18.79 to 41.59 mg/liter. The antibacterial activity of NTX was higher in acidic urine than in alkaline urine, and that of TMP was higher in alkaline urine than in acidic urine. The UITs and UBTs of NTX were generally lower than those of TMP except for a TMP-resistant Escherichia coli strain, for which NTX showed higher UITs/UBTs than did TMP. UBK showed mainly bacteriostatic activity of NTX in urine. NTX exhibits mainly bacteriostatic activity and TMP also shows bactericidal activity in urine against susceptible strains. NTX is a more active antibacterial in acidic urine, and TMP is more active in alkaline urine. The cumulative effects of multiple doses or inhibition of bacterial adherence could not be evaluated. (This study has been registered at EudraCT under registration no. 2009-015631-32.).
TI  - Fosfomycin trometamol: a review of its use as a single-dose oral treatment for patients with acute lower urinary tract infections and pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  - Fosfomycin trometamol (fosfomycin tromethamine) [Monuril((R)), Monurol((R)), Monural((R))] is approved in numerous countries worldwide, mainly for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Fosfomycin has good in vitro activity against common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli), Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and the susceptibility of uropathogens to fosfomycin has remained relatively stable over time. A single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol 3 g (the approved dosage) achieves high concentrations in urine. Results of recent randomized trials indicate that single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to 3- to 7-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin in women with uncomplicated lower UTIs. In addition, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol had similar bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, and similar clinical and/or bacteriological efficacy to a 5-day course of cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or a 3-day course of ceftibuten in pregnant women with a lower UTI. Single-dose fosfomycin trometamol was generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea) reported most commonly. In conclusion, single-dose fosfomycin trometamol is an important option for the first-line empirical treatment of uncomplicated lower UTIs.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the United States during 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) from 19 hospital sites within the United States. Susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. METHODS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL (ESBL) isolates were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's recommended phenotypic test. Isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom MicroScan dehydrated broth microdilution panels ESBLs and carbapenemases were characterized using the Check-Points microarray. Strain typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-PCR on the DiversiLab System. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were Escherichia coli (36%), K. pneumoniae (18.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). Incidence of ESBL-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. Against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against ESBL-positive isolates of E. coli. All other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. Against K. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against ESBL-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (KPC2 or KPC3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an ESBL remained susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.
TI  - An Increase in the clinical isolation of acquired AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Korea from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - We investigated the occurrence and genetic basis of AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC)-mediated antibiotic resistance, by examining Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates at a university hospital, from 2007 to 2010. The ampC genes were detected by multiplex AmpC PCR, and AmpC-positive strains were subjected to DNA sequencing. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was assessed using the ESBL disk test based on the utilization of boronic acid. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were further investigated by the modified Hodge test, a carbapenemase inhibition test and SDS-PAGE experiments. AmpC expression was detected in 1.6% of E. coli (39 DHA-1, 45 CMY-2, and 1 CMY-1) isolates, 7.2% of K. pneumoniae (39 DHA-1, 45 CMY-2, and 1 CMY-1) isolates, and 2.5% of P. mirabilis (8 CMY-2 and 1 CMY-1) isolates. Of the 198 acquired AmpC producers, 58 isolates (29.3%) also produced an ESBL enzyme. Among the acquired AmpC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) MIC50/MIC90 values for cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem were >32/>32, 16/>32, 1/16, 0.25/0.5, and <0.125/0.125 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC values for carbapenem were >/=2 microg/mL for 2 K. pneumoniae isolates, both of which carried the bla DHA-1 gene with a loss of OmpK36 expression, but were negative for carbapenemase production. The acquisition of AmpC-mediated resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates increased, as did the proportion of AmpC and ESBL co-producers among the hospital isolates. The accurate identification of isolates producing AmpCs and ESBLs may aid in infection control and will assist physicians in selecting an appropriate antibiotic regimen.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Potential of the Lichen Parmotrema sp. Extracts against Various Pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): The ongoing increasing antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest  challenges faced by global public health. The perennial need for new antimicrobials against a background of increasing antibiotic resistance in pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms obliges the scientific community to constantly develop new drugs and antimicrobial agents. Lichens are known prolific sources of natural antimicrobial drugs and biologically active natural products. This study was aimed to explore in vitro antimicrobial activity of lichen Parmotrema sp. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methanol and aqueous extracts of lichen Parmotrema sp. was extracted using Soxhlet extractor. Antibiotic assessment of methanol and aqueous extracts was done against eight bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Enterococci faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,) clinical pathogens and five plant pathogenic fungal strains (Aspergillus terreus strain JAS1, Scedosporium sp. JAS1, Ganoderma sp. JAS4, Candida tropicalis and Fusarium sp.) by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: The methanol lichen Parmotrema sp. extract inhibited all the test organisms. The highest antibacterial activity was found against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The weakest activity was manifested in Salmonella sp. and Scedosporium sp. JAS1. Strong antifungal effect was found against Ganoderma sp. JAS4 and Fusarium sp. The aqueous lichen Parmotrema sp. extract revealed neither antibacterial nor antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that tested lichen Parmotrema sp. extracts demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect. That suggests the active components from methanol extracts of the investigated lichen Parmotrema sp. can be used as natural antimicrobial agent against pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four Enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) collected from Taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against Escherichia coli (n = 344), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 78). Susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in 2013. The double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to confirm production of ESBL for isolates with cephalosporin MIC >/= 2 mug/mL. RESULTS: A total of 175 isolates were verified as ESBL producers. The rates of cefepime susceptibility among the ESBL-producing isolates, according to CLSI (EUCAST) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for E. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for K. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for E. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for P. mirabilis. Using different cefepime MIC breakpoints (MICs >/= 16 mug/mL recommended by CLSI criteria and >/= 2 mug/mL by EUCAST criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting ESBL producers among K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae than among the other two species. In addition, we also found that the cefepime MIC level of 1.0 mug/mL best distinguished non-ESBL- from ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae. CONCLUSION: To detect ESBLs, CLSI should revise the cefepime MIC breakpoint against Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.

TI  - Emergence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in Andaman Islands, India.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of India. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. Significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes Escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); Enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and Proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). The uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different resistance patterns. Among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% CI 62.13-100.37%) and 11 (68.8%, 95% CI 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. Multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A total of 7 (44%, 95% CI 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants The present study reports for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene in two isolates of P. mirabilis in these islands. Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Comparison of double disk synergy test, VITEK 2 and Check-MDR CT102 for detection of ESBL producing isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to define the statistical significance for detection of  ESBL producers by the double disk synergy test and molecular test (Check-MDR CT102), microdilution test (VITEK 2 with AES) and double disk synergy test (DDST), as well as the microdilution test and molecular test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phenotypic testing of 55 isolates Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli (14/55), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34/55), Klebsiella oxytoca (3/55) and Proteus mirabilis (4/55) was performed by VITEK 2 Compact/AES. When this test showed positive results for the ESBL phenotype, then DDST with amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, aztreonam, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin disks was performed along with Check-MDR CT102 which identified CTX-M, TEM and SHV beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Applying the McNemar test, we determined that there was a statistically significant difference in the results of detection of ESBLs bacteria using DDST compared to molecular methods (95% CI=41.92 to 54.55; p<0.0001), as well as a DDST and VITEK 2/AES (95% CI=40.13 to 52.73; p<0.0001). We did not find any statistically significant difference in the results of detection of ESBL producers using molecular techniques and VITEK 2/AES (CI=-4,43 to 5,36; p=1). Also we did not find any statistical.. difference between the resistance to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone (50/50) compared to the results of molecular tests. CONCLUSION: In routine daily testing, good detection of ESBLs bacteria, especially CTX-M can be obtained with phenotypic methods with VITEK 2/AES and by DDST with cefpodoxime, and ceftriaksone disks.
TI  - Occurrence of the CTX-M, SHV and the TEM Genes Among the Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamase Producing Isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in a Tertiary Care Hospital of North India.
AB  - PURPOSE: The present study was carried out to assess the prevalence of the Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBLs) and to characterize the ESBL types which were prevalent in our hospital. MATERIAL METHODS: Five hundred gram negative isolates which belonged to the family, Enterobacteriaceae, which were isolated during the study period of 2009 to 2011, were investigated for ESBL production. Clinical isolates from urine (344), pus (109), blood (15), IV/ central line tip (10), sputum (12) and body fluid (10) specimens were processed. The organisms which were identified, included E.coli (351), Klebsiella pneumoniae (74), Klebsiella oxytoca (21), Proteus mirabilis (15), Proteus vulgaris (9), Enterobacter spp (15) and Citrobacterspp (15). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done. The ESBL detection was carried out for all the isolates by the CLSI confirmatory method. The MIC of ceftazidime and ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid was determined by the E-test. Molecular typing of the ESBLs was performed by multiplex PCR among 93 ESBL isolates. RESULTS: 45.8% isolates were found to be ESBL producers by the CLSI confirmatory method and they were confirmed by the E-test ESBL strips. A majority of E.coli in the study possessed the CTX-M genes (59.32%). Among the Klebsiella isolates, a majority were co producers of the ESBL genes; either 2 or all the 3 genes co-existed together. CONCLUSION: An indiscriminate use of the higher antibiotics should be restricted as far as possible. The infection control programmes should be monitored continuously in hospitals, to contain these ESBL producers. We are reporting the presence of all types of ESBL genes among the Enterobacteriaceae isolates from our hospital setting.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of inpatient urinary tract isolates of gram-negative bacilli in the United States: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (SMART) program: 2009-2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends is an ongoing global surveillance program that has monitored the susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacilli from inpatient urinary tract infections (UTIs) since late 2009. OBJECTIVE: This analysis reports on the in vitro susceptibility of 2,135 isolates collected by 24 US sites from hospitalized patients with UTIs between 2009 and 2011. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations and susceptibility were determined according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Of the isolates collected, 88.6% (1,892) were Enterobacteriaceae, which included 48.9% (n = 1,045) Escherichia coli, 14.5% (n = 310) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.4% (n = 136) Proteus mirabilis, 2.5% (n = 54) Klebsiella oxytoca, and 16.3% (n = 347) other Enterobacteriaceae species. Overall, 6.8% of E coli, 10.3% of K pneumoniae, 3.7% of P mirabilis, and 11.1% of K oxytoca isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 67.5% were community associated and 26.9% were hospital associated (5.7% had no demographics). Highest overall rates of activity for the study period were seen with amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem. The least active antimicrobials tested were ampicillin-sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin were the most active study drugs against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, although the activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K pneumoniae did not exceed 69% throughout the study period. The results of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends surveillance study document the rates of antimicrobial resistance in UTI pathogens in the United States, which can assist health care practitioners in selecting the appropriate treatment for UTIs.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough UTI or not. METHODS: We compared children with infantile VUR with recurrent UTI (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent UTI (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). The following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of UTI episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). RESULTS: Univariate Cox survival-time regression showed that younger age at first UTI, a non-Escherichia coli strain, bilateral and VUR, high-grade VUR, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (USG) significantly increased the risks of recurrent UTI (P <.05 each). In multivariate analysis, timing of the UTI episode (P = .015), a non-E. coli strain (P = .003), high grade (P = .012), and bilateral VUR (P = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI. Non-E. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent UTI, respectively. CONCLUSION: During the first year of life, the earlier the first UTI then the higher the chance is for recurrent UTIs. Higher grades of reflux, bilateral VUR, and the first infection by a non-E. coli strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent UTIs.
TI  - Epidemiology and susceptibility of Gram-negative appendicitis pathogens: SMART 2008-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) has  tracked the in vitro activity of ertapenem and comparators against aerobic gram-negative bacteria from intra-abdominal infections since 2002. This report describes the epidemiology and susceptibility for clinical isolates associated with appendicitis, collected from 2008 to 2010. METHODS: A total of 1,720 gram-negative bacilli were collected from patients with appendicitis in 122 hospitals in 39 countries worldwide; of these, 23% of isolates were from pediatric patients (</= 17 years old). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were determined by broth microdilution and interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: The global ESBL-positive rate was 16.3%, ranging from 2.2% for Proteus mirabilis to 16.6% for Escherichia coli and 20.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The ESBL-positive rates differed by age group (17.7% in adults vs. 11.4% in children) and by geographic region, with significantly higher rates in Asia/Pacific (28.0%) and significantly lower rates in North America (9.1%), Africa/Middle East (4.8%), and Europe (4.4%). Amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem were the most active of the tested agents against aerobic gram-negative appendicitis pathogens across pediatric and adult age groups and across geographic regions, including ESBL-positive isolates. Cefepime and ceftazidime were active against >/= 90% of global pediatric isolates. E. coli, by far the most frequently isolated species (68% in adults and 75% in pediatric patients), was significantly less susceptible in adults than in pediatric patients (p<0.05; Fisher exact test) to all tested agents except amikacin, ertapenem, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam (with the latter showing low activity in both age groups). CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data suggest that amikacin, imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ertapenem would perform well against aerobic gram-negative bacilli associated with appendicitis in both adults and children, especially in regions with high rates of ESBL-positive E. coli.
TI  - Community spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli,  Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis: a long-term study in Japan.
AB  - Community-acquired infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, particularly CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli, are a rising concern worldwide. There are few data from Japan on the acquisition of ESBLs in the community or the influx of these bacteria into hospitals. Therefore, we examined the prevalence of ESBL carriage in outpatients, in order to estimate the spread of ESBLs in community settings. We analysed bacterial isolates from outpatient samples at our institution over a 9-year period from 2003 to 2011, with respect to epidemiological data on ESBL-producing bacteria and their genotypic features. Out of 5137 isolates, 321 (6.3 %) were ESBL producers, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The detection rates of the ESBL-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 14.3, 8.7 and 19.6 % for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis strains, respectively, in 2011. Genotyping analysis showed that many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases, including TEM, SHV and CTX-M, rather than just CTX-M. The CTX-M-9 group was dominant among the CTX-M genotypes; further, the CTX-M-1 and M-2 groups were also detected (~30 %). This is believed to be the first report from Japan showing a definite increase in ESBL detection in outpatients. In addition, our findings suggest the simultaneous community spread of diverse ESBL genotypes, not an expansion of particular ESBL genes.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicentre Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2009.
AB  - To investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and Burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by the CLSI as well as 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by EUCAST. Based on CLSI 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. All Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii isolates were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of P. mirabilis and all M. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae with ertapenem MICs>/=4 mg/L were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. Imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, respectively. Additionally, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=8 mg/L were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. These data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=4 mg/L.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Analysis of the spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in vitro: results based on a retrospective study from a tertiary hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing worldwide. This study aimed to compare the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens in community-acquired UTIs (CAUTIs) and nosocomial-acquired UTIs (NAUTIs) at a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of uropathogens from UTI patients was performed at Zhong Da Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1129 strains was isolated from 653 community-acquired and 476 nosocomial-acquired infections. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen, accounting for 55.9% of the CAUTIs and 27.1% of the NAUTIs. Among the CAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed in prevalence by Enterococcus spp (12.9%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.7%). Among the NAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed by Enterococcus spp (15.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9%). The proportion of fungi in the NAUTIs (23.7%) was higher than that in the CAUTIs (3.1%) (P < .05). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of E coli accounted for 70.6% of the NAUTIs and 47.3% of the CAUTIs. Carbapenems, amikacin, and nitrofurantoin were active agents against E coli. The resistance rates of E coli to cephalosporins, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, quinolones, and gentamicin were higher in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The distribution of species was different between CAUTIs and NAUTIs. Higher antibiotic resistance rates were observed in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs.
TI  - Microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in Central Alabama.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. They are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. The purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in Central Alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. This was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile at this Central Alabama hospital. The survey period was between July 2009 and June 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed and susceptibility testing was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution method. The results indicated that Escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). For the 215 E. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, P < 0.05). In contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, P < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this Central Alabama hospital. Additionally, this study found that E. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (Lee et al. 2010; Rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. It is imperative to monitor the resistance of P. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - Chemical and antimicrobial studies on the essential oil from Salvia santolinifolia Boiss.
AB  - In view of the reputation of genus Salvia in folklore medicine and its abundance  in our region, the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil from S. santolinifolia Boiss. was analyzed. Chemical analysis, using gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, retention indices and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has resulted in identification of 116 constituents, comprising about 97% of the total constituents. Out of these 116, 78 constituents are hitherto unreported from this source. The species belongs to alpha-pinene chemotype. In antibacterial assay, gram negative gastropathogens (Shigella boydii, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae); causative agent of urinary tract infection (Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris) and pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae) were found sensitive to this essential oil while Corynebacteria species and Staphylococcus epidermidis were significantly inhibited in antibacterial assay against gram positive bacteria. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol was used for determining antimicrobial activity. Thus the essential oil from this species can be utilized as potential chemotherapeutic agent.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial lectin from Schinus terebinthifolius leaf.
AB  - AIMS: Schinus terebinthifolius leaves are used for treating human diseases caused by micro-organisms. This work reports the isolation, characterization and antimicrobial activity of S. terebinthifolius leaf lectin (SteLL). METHODS AND RESULTS: The isolation procedure involved protein extraction with 0.15 mol l(-1) NaCl, filtration through activated charcoal and chromatography of the filtrate on a chitin column. SteLL is a 14-kDa glycopeptide with haemagglutinating activity that is inhibited by N-acetyl-glucosamine, not affected by ions (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) and stable upon heating (30-100 degrees C) as well as over the pH 5.0-8.0. The antimicrobial effect of SteLL was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitory (MIC), bactericide (MBC) and fungicide (MFC) concentrations. Lectin was active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Highest bacteriostatic and bactericide effects were detected for Salm. enteritidis (MIC: 0.45 mug ml(-1)) and Staph. aureus (MBC: 7.18 mug ml(-1)), respectively. SteLL impaired the growth (MIC: 6.5 mug ml(-1)) and survival (MFC: 26 mug ml(-1)) of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS: SteLL, a chitin-binding lectin, purified in milligram quantities, showed antimicrobial activity against medically important bacteria and fungi. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: SteLL can be considered as a new biomaterial for potential antimicrobial applications.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Risk factors and clinical impact of levofloxacin or cefazolin nonsusceptibility or ESBL production among uropathogens in adults with community-onset urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacilli causing community-onset urinary tract infections (CoUTIs) are getting increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. Clinical significance and risk factors of the acquisition of antimicrobial-nonsusceptible pathogens are still under investigation. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in the medical wards of two hospitals in southern Taiwan between August 2009 and January 2012. Patients were enrolled if they were aged >18, admitted through the emergency department, and had CoUTI due to Enterobacteriaceae isolates. RESULTS: Overall 136 adults with CoUTI were enrolled. Their mean age was 67 years and females were predominant (68.4%). Comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (30.1%) and hypertension (54.4%), were common. Escherichia coli (111, 81.6%) was the predominant species, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (11, 8.1%), and Proteus mirabilis (7, 5.1%). Nine (8.0%) of E. coli isolates and 5 (45%) of K. pneumoniae isolates had extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Out of 122 non-ESBL producing isolates, 35 (28.7%) and 31 (25.4%) were nonsusceptible to levofloxacin and cefazolin, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, several clinical characters were found to be independently associated with CoUTIs due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, diabetes mellitus, and altered consciousness, or absence of chills, pyuria, or tachycardia), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (i.e. males, recent hospitalization, underlying old stroke, absence of fever or chills), or ESBL-producing isolates (i.e. recent hospitalization or antimicrobial therapy). All patients survived and discharged. However, the patients with CoUTIs due to levofloxacin-nonsusceptible (16.1 vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.01), cefazolin-nonsusceptible (15.4 vs. 8.4 days, p < 0.01) or ESBL-producing (16.7 vs. 9.6 days; p < 0.01) pathogens had a longer hospitalization stay than those due to their susceptible comparators. CONCLUSION: Several host factors were recognized to be independently associated with the acquisition of UTIs due to levofloxacin- or cefazolin- nonsusceptible, or ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The clinical impact of UTIs due to nonsusceptible uropathogens is that they result in the prolongation of hospital stays.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - The relative importance of Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major Swedish laboratory.
AB  - To determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on Staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large Swedish cohort. S. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of UTIs in this patient group being caused by S. saprophyticus. We hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings. During the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the Karolinska University Hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. Patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. The most common pathogens were E. coli (57.0%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), K. pneumoniae (5.9%), group B streptococci (5.7%), P. mirabilis (3.0%) and S. saprophyticus (1.8%). The majority of subjects with S. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of age (63.8%). In this age group, S. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. S. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with E. coli even in this patient group. For women in other ages and for men, growth of S. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.
TI  - Emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are considered as first line drugs to treat infectious diseases. In order to find out useful fluoroquinolones, the antibiotic resistance of fluoroquinolones, namely, ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NRF), enoxacin (ENX), pefloxacin (PFL) and levofloxacin (LVF) was investigated against ninety five clinical isolates that includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In vitro activity of these isolates was carried out by agar dilution method. All Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to OFL at 2 mug/ml. About 6% isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistance to LVF and ENX, 6% to CIP, OFL and PFL and none of the isolates were resistant to LVF and ENX. Percentage resistance of P. aeruginosa was found to be 4.35% to CIP, 7% to OFL and 2.2% to NRF, whereas 8.69% to ENX, 0% to PFL and 17.4% to LVF, respectively. The present study provides the data about the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative bacteria and strongly recommends the rational and appropriate use of these antibiotics.
TI  - [Randomized comparative study for the assessment of a new therapeutic schedule of fosfomycin trometamol in postmenopausal women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare two therapeutic regimes in terms of bacterial eradication  of post-menopausal with uncomplicated acute cystitis who complete antibiotic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A multicenter, randomized, prospective and controlled study between two short antibiotic regimes: fosfomycin trometamol (FMT) 3g, 2 doses separated by 72hours and ciprofloxacin 250mg every 12hours for 3 days. A total of 118 post-menopausal women were enrolled in the study. They underwent an initial urine culture to know the responsible microorganism and susceptibility to treatment. This was repeated 5-7 days and 4 weeks after the treatment to evaluate bacterial eradication. Clinical symptoms and treatment safety were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were microbiological data at the onset of the treatment in 82 women (69.49%). Of these, 27 did not have positive culture at the first visit (30.51%), 76 (64.41%) fulfilled all the protocol requirements and adverse effects from the treatment were collected in 113 (95.76%) of the patients enrolled in the study. The germs isolated most frequently were Escherichia coli (E. coli) (76.83%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (7.32%), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (4.89%) and Enterococo sp. (3.66%). In terms of efficacy, no differences were detected in the proportion of patients who achieved bacterial eradication between the two study arms: 62.16% of the patients who received FMT and 58.97% of those treated with ciprofloxacin (chi-square, p=0.78). The proportion of patients who achieved clinical cure was also similar (86.49% for FMT and 82.05% for ciprofloxacin; square, p=0.59). These results indicate similar efficacy of both antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women. In regards to safety data, the proportion of global adverse effects associated to the treatments was 3.45% for FMT and 9.09% for ciprofloxacin. Treatment compliance was 100% for FMT and 83.64% for ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The FMT administered at a dose of 3g every 72hours (2 total doses) and ciprofloxacin at a dose of 250mg every 12hours during 3 days (6 total doses) have a comparable efficacy profile in lower tract urinary infection in post-menopausal women who adequately comply with the treatment, also having comparable safety. The FMT has a better antimicrobial susceptibility profile and better rate of treatment compliance.
TI  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening  infection that is seen most commonly in persons with diabetes. The infecting organisms usually consist of mixed flora, including Escherichia coli (68%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Proteus mirabilis. Females are affected twice as often as men, and mortality rates can be as high as 80%. Obstructive uropathy, urinary calculi, calyceal stenosis and neoplasms are significant predisposing factors. We report a case of EPN in a patient with the human immunodeficiency virus infection, without diabetes mellitus or urinary tract obstruction, which responded remarkably to conservative management with antibiotics alone.
TI  - The effect of plum juice on the prevention of struvite calculus formation in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of plum juice on struvite calculus formation in vitro and to explore the effect of plum juice on urease-producing bacteria and urease activity. The compliance of available drugs is low for struvite calculus after surgical treatment and functional food may represent a good choice as an alternative therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activity was assessed using a microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test. Urease activity was determined by measuring ammonia production. Struvite crystals were induced by Proteus mirabilis in artificial urine with natural and pH-adjusted plum juice. The optical density (OD)(600) and pH of artificial urine were examined, as well the shape and weights of crystals. RESULTS: Natural plum juice showed an antibacterial effect on urease-producing bacteria, whereas the pH-adjusted juice did not. A concentration-dependent inhibition on urease activity was found for both natural and pH-adjusted juice. Natural plum juice at a high concentration of 0.5% showed an obvious inhibition on the increase of OD(600) and pH of the artificial urine, and crystal formation was prevented by up to or more than 8 h, depending on the concentration of juice. Crystal weight in the natural plum juice groups was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The pH-adjusted plum juice did not show any effect on OD(600) and pH, although the presence of juice changed the crystal habit, indicating that the juice slowed the growth rate of crystals. CONCLUSIONS: Natural plum juice at high and moderate concentrations prevented the formation of P. mirabilis-induced crystals for up to 8 h in artificial urine. Although pH-adjusted and low-concentration natural juice did not prevent the occurrence of crystals, both types of juice slowed their growth rate.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - Cross-reacting antibacterial auto-antibodies are produced within coronary atherosclerotic plaques of acute coronary syndrome patients.
AB  - Coronary atherosclerosis, the main condition predisposing to acute myocardial infarction, has an inflammatory component caused by stimuli that are yet unknown. We molecularly investigated the nature of the immune response within human coronary lesion in four coronary plaques obtained by endoluminal atherectomy from four patients. We constructed phage-display libraries containing the IgG1/kappa antibody fragments produced by B-lymphocytes present in each plaque. By immunoaffinity, we selected from these libraries a monoclonal antibody, arbitrarily named Fab7816, able to react both with coronary and carotid atherosclerotic tissue samples. We also demonstrated by confocal microscopy that this monoclonal antibody recognized human transgelin type 1, a cytoskeleton protein involved in atherogenesis, and that it co-localized with fibrocyte-like cells transgelin+, CD68+, CD45+ in human sections of coronary and carotid plaques. In vitro fibrocytes obtained by differentiating CD14+ cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells also interacted with Fab7816, thus supporting the hypothesis of a specific recognition of fibrocytes into the atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, the same antibody, cross-reacted with the outer membrane proteins of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (and possibly with homologous proteins of other enterobacteriaceae present in the microbiota). From all the other three libraries, we were able to clone, by immunoaffinity selection, human monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with bacterial outer membrane proteins and with transgelin. These findings demonstrated that in human atherosclerotic plaques a local cross-reactive immune response takes place.
TI  - Epidemiology and genetic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections in long-term care facilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess risk factors for acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL+ GN) causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). METHODS: A prospective case-case-control study was carried out. In the first study, cases were defined as patients harbouring ESBL+ GN, while, in the second study, cases were defined as patients harbouring ESBL-negative (ESBL-) GN. Controls were selected by simple random sampling from patients without GN infection. ESBL determinants were characterized by hybridization, and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: The study involved 297 LTCF patients (99 with ESBL+ GN UTI, 99 with ESBL- GN UTI and 99 without GN infection). ESBL+ GN UTIs were due to Escherichia coli (64%), Proteus mirabilis (25%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%). The CTX-M-type enzymes were the most prevalent (73% of isolates), whereas TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs and AmpC-type enzymes were less prevalent (10%, 2% and 15% of isolates, respectively). Patients with ESBL+ GN UTI were more likely to have a permanent urinary catheter (OR 15, 95% CI 6.9-30.5) and to have received antimicrobial therapy in the previous 30 days (OR 4, 95% CI 1.2-10.9). After adjusting for type, dosage and duration of antibiotic, exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins was associated with the highest risk of ESBL+ GN UTI development (OR 7, 95% CI 1.2-40). Independent risk factors for acquiring ESBL- GN UTIs were previous surgical procedures (OR 2, 95% CI 1.1-4) and the presence of a urinary catheter (OR 8, 95% CI 4-16). No specific antibiotics remained a significant risk for ESBL- GN UTI after adjusting for demographic and clinical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to >/=7 days of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins significantly increases the risk of ESBL+ GN UTI. Interventions aimed at improving compliance with antimicrobial stewardship principles should be further developed and implemented in LTCFs.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection in tertiary care hospital of eastern Nepal.
AB  - Emergence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates has important clinical and therapeutic implications. A high prevalence of ESBL production among multidrug resistant gram negative isolates has been reported in literature from various clinical samples. Since ESBL detection is not done on a routine basis, its prevalence is not known till date. Thus the present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection. A total of 300 gram negative bacilli isolated from the pus samples were identified phenotypically and antimicrobial activity was determined. ESBL detection among the isolated organisms was done by Phenotypic confirmatory disc diffusion technique recommended by CLSI. Of the 300 isolates, majority were Escherichia coli; (107) followed by Acinetobacter species; (55), Pseudomonas species; (44), Klebsiella pneumoniae; (32), Proteus mirabilis; (26), Enterobacter species; (25), Citrobacter species; (9) and others; (2). The prevalence of ESBL producing organisms was found to be 54 (18%); amongst which Escherichia coli was 29 (53.7%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14.8%), Proteus mirabilis 7 (12.9%) and others 4 (7.4%). Multidrug resistance were found in 92.6% of ESBL producers. Forty two were resistant to all the three third generation cephalosporins. The continuous surveillance of the ESBL producing isolates is necessary to make aware about the correct treatment regimens and good infection control practices.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2008. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.8% of Escherichia coli, 2.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of Klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of Proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of Proteus vulgaris. ESBL produced strains were 6.8% at K. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at P. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. Among Haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. Although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL and doripenem showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa have potent activity. Of all P. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
TI  - Changing antibiotic susceptibilities of community-acquired uropathogens in Greece, 2005-2010.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution and changes  in the antibiotic susceptibilities of uropathogens isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) in Crete, Greece, over a 6-year period. METHODS: This study was performed with isolates from outpatients with UTIs, collected between 2005 and 2010. Isolates were identified by standard methods and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method and the VITEK2 is an automated system used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms (BioMerieux). To identify changes in susceptibility patterns, we compared results of the period 2005-2007 to those of the period 2008-2010. We also compared the antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates between males and females. RESULTS: A total of 4011 community-acquired uropathogens were isolated during the period of 2005-2010. Escherichia coli was the most common organism and responsible for 68.9% of CA-UTIs, followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and enterococci (6%). A significant increase in resistance of E coli isolates was noted for beta-lactams, monobactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cotrimoxazole. The reverse trend was evident for nitrofurantoin. Higher resistance rates of community-acquired E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae were noted in males for ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. No significant sex differences were noted in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of enterococci. CONCLUSION: There is a concerning trend for increasing resistance among E coli and non-E coli Enterobacteriaceae responsible for CA-UTIs in Crete in recent years likely due to the inappropriate use of broad spectrum antibiotics, as a substitute for precise diagnostics and/or to increase the chances of therapeutic success.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: in vitro susceptibility to fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility trends of community-acquired extended-spectrum beta-Iactamase (ESBL)-producing urinary isolates with particular reference to fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hospitals across the United Arab Emirates participated in this study from June 2008 to March 2010. The antibiotic sensitivity of ESBL-producing uropathogens to a panel of antibiotics including tigecycline, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin was assessed. The Hyplex ESBL identification system (h-ES-ID) was used for genotypic identification. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-two ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were identified during the study period. Of these, 182 (62%) were urinary isolates and comprised of Escherichia coli: 149 (81.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae: 30 (16.5%) and Proteus mirabilis: 3 (1.6%). Of the 182 urinary isolates, 179 (98.3%) were from patients with community onset urinary tract infections. The h-ES-ID system identified 172 (94.5%) of the urinary isolates as CTX-M positive. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Over half of the isolates showed resistance to gentamicin (98; 53.8%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (139; 76.4%) and ciprofloxacin (143; 78.6%). Sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin was 90 and 100%, respectively. Two CTX-M-positive K. pneumoniae isolates with tigecycline resistance (MIC >4 microg/ml) were identified. CONCLUSION: There is dissemination of CTX-M ESBL-producing urinary pathogens into the community. Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin were active against ESBL-positive uropathogens, and emergence of tigecycline resistance needs close monitoring.
TI  - Evaluation of a double synergy differential test (DSDT) for differential detection of ESBL and AmpC-type beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - This work describes a simple and practical double synergy differential test (DSDT) that couples the detection of ESBLs and AmpC-type enzymes by means of a combo-disk approach using cefotaxime and ceftazidime as indicator substrates, and clavulanate and boronic acid as enzyme inhibitors. The DSDT was tested with a collection of 118 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains with different beta-lactamase profiles, and proved to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of ESBL and AmpC-producing isolates.
TI  - [Emergence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins by Enterobacteriaceae causing community-onset urinary tract infections in hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in the community, and a matter of concern due to the increasing resistance of microorganisms to first line antibiotics and the emergence of multiresistant strains producing extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) in the community. METHODS: An analytical case-control study was conducted over twelve months in 9 hospitals in Colombia. We collected isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. from patients with community-onset UTI. The presence of ESBL, AmpC and KPC beta-lactamases were characterized by microbiological and molecular methods. The aim of this study was to determine factors related to the presence of these mechanisms of the resistance to third generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: A total of 325 isolates (287 E. coli, 29 Klebsiella spp. and 9 Proteus spp.) were included. The most frequent comorbidities among the patients were hypertension (n=82; 25.2%) and diabetes mellitus (n=68; 20.9%). Previous use of antimicrobials was found in 23% of patients, and 29% had a previous UTI. Resistance to third and fourth generation cephalosporins varied between 3.4% and 6.3% in E. coli and between 6.9% and 17.8% in K. pneumoniae. Seven (2.4%) CTX-M-15 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected; four of them belonged to ST 131 clone. In K. pneumoniae we detected three KPC-3 carbapenemases (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the emergence of resistance to third generation cephalosporins enterobacteriaceae as a cause of community-onset UTI. We emphasize the presence of ST 131 clone and KPC carbapenemases circulating in Colombia outside the hospital environment.
TI  - Epidemiology and genetics of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - CTX-M enzymes, the plasmid-mediated cefotaximases, constitute a rapidly growing family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) with significant clinical impact. CTX-Ms are found in at least 26 bacterial species, particularly in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. At least 109 members in CTX-M family are identified and can be divided into seven clusters based on their phylogeny. CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-14 are the most dominant variants. Chromosome-encoded intrinsic cefotaximases in Kluyvera spp. are proposed to be the progenitors of CTX-Ms, while ISEcp1, ISCR1 and plasmid are closely associated with their mobilization and dissemination.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - [Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in non-inducible AmpC enterobacteria: evaluation of the new MIC breakpoints].
AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the in vitro activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) in non-inducible AmpC enterobacteria thromicrogh phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the mechanisms of resistance (ESBL, plasmid-mediated AmpC and KPC) and to evaluate the interpretation criteria proposed by the existing recommendations and the new breakpoints established by the CLSI and the EUCAST. Susceptibility tests and PCR multiplex for b/aSHV and b/aCTX-M and amplification using specific primers was performed. One hundred sixty nine resistant isolates: K/ebsie//a pneumoniae (95), Escherichia co/i (55), and Proteus mirabi/is (19) were recovered. ESC resistance was 56.2 %, 32.6%, and 11.2 %, respectively. ESBL was detected in 152 (90 %) isolates, plasmid-mediated AmpC in 12 (7 %) and KPC in 5 (3 %). The CLSI 2009 recommendations and the breakpoints smicroggested by the CLSI 2010 and the EUCAST for ceftriaxone were efficacious to detect ESBL, whereas the different breakpoints for ceftazidime presented discrepancies. The CLSI 2010 breakpoints only detected 55 % of the ESBL-producing isolates due to the endemic presence of CTX-M ESBLs in our country. Regarding the plasmid-mediated AmpC producers, the recommendations of the CLSI 2010 and the EUCAST 2010 proved to be more efficient than the old ones.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and antibiotics.
AB  - Synergistic activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were evaluated. Interactions between plant extracts and antibiotics were tested by checkerboard method and interpreted as FIC index. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were used. Salvia officinalis showed better synergistic capacity than Cichorium intybus. Synergistic interactions were observed between amoxicillin and acetone or ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis and between chloramphenicol and ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration (1/4 MIC to 1/32 MIC) of sage extracts, the MIC values of antibiotics were decreased by 2- to 10-fold. Synergism was observed against all test bacteria, except Escherichia coli. The combinations of acetone and ethyl acetate extract from Cichorium intybus and antibiotics resulted in additive and indifferent effects against tested bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of major uropathogens in a single-pot multiplex PCR assay.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections and poses a significant healthcare burden. Escherichia coli is the most common cause of UTI accounting for up to 70 % and a variable contribution from Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To establish a complete diagnostic system, we have developed a single-tube multiplex PCR assay (mPCR) for the detection of the above-mentioned four major uropathogens. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be as low as 10(2) cfu/ml of cells. The mPCR evaluated on 280 clinical isolates detected 100 % of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis and 95 % of K. pneumonia. The assay was performed on 50 urine samples and found to be specific and sensitive for clinical diagnosis. In addition, the mPCR was also validated on spiked urine samples using 40 clinical isolates to demonstrate its application under different strain used in this assay. In total, mPCR reported here is a rapid and simple screening tool that can compete with conventional biochemical-based screening assays that may require 2-3 days for detection.
TI  - Identification and molecular characterisation of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1)- and NDM-6-producing Enterobacteriaceae from New Zealand hospitals.
AB  - The global spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) is of significant public health concern. This study sought to determine whether bla(NDM) was present in Enterobacteriaceae isolates displaying resistance to carbapenems that were submitted to the National Antibiotic Reference Laboratory, Institute of Environmental Science and Research (Porirua, New Zealand) during 2009 and 2010. Isolates were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase genes and 16S rRNA methylase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Plasmid transfer studies were undertaken on isolates found to be harbouring bla(NDM). Molecular typing was performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The bla(NDM-1) gene was identified in four Enterobacteriaceae isolates (two Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Proteus mirabilis) from four patients in New Zealand hospitals in 2009 and 2010. In addition, the bla(NDM-6) gene, which differed from bla(NDM-1) by a point mutation at position 698 (C-->T), was also identified in an E. coli isolate from the same patient who harboured the bla(NDM-1)-positive P. mirabilis. All four patients had recently been hospitalised or received health care in India. Four of the isolates also produced a CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase, and all five isolates harboured the plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase rmtC gene. The E. coli types were diverse by MLST, and the K. pneumoniae isolate belonged to the internationally disseminated sequence type 11 (ST11) clone. These findings further illustrate the diversity of phenotypic and genotypic features found in association with bla(NDM), in addition to documenting the international spread of this resistance mechanism, notably into a country with historically low rates of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Globally dispersed mobile drug-resistance genes in gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in a US urban general hospital.
AB  - Mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. Over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (GNB) pathogens from the blood of inpatients at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. Of 376 GNB isolates, 167 (44 %) were Escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were Proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were Enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different GNB species. Among E. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). The most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfrA17-aadA5, found in 30 (25 %) of 119 drug-resistant E. coli isolates and in one isolate of Moraxella morganii. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes were found in 16 E. coli isolates (10 %). These genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream E. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. Thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by E. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.
TI  - Epidemiology of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples in the Kinki Region of Japan.
AB  - In the present study, nonduplicate, clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Proteus mirabilis were collected during a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009 at several hospitals in the Kinki region, Japan. The detection rate of E coli markedly increased from 0.24% to 7.25%. The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 0% to 2.44% and that of P mirabilis from 6.97% to 12.85%. The most frequently detected genotypes were the CTX-M9 group for E coli, the CTX-M2 group for K pneumoniae, and the CTX-M2 group for P mirabilis. E coli clone O25:H4-ST131 producing CTX-M-15, which is spreading worldwide, was first detected in 2007. The most common replicon type of E coli was the IncF type, particularly FIB, detected in 466 strains (69.7%). Of the K pneumoniae strains, 47 (55.3%) were of the IncN type; 77 P mirabilis strains (96.3%) were of the IncT type. In the future, the surveillance of various resistant bacteria, mainly ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, should be expanded to prevent their spread.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in Greece.
AB  - The reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Danish clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: prevalence, beta-lactamase distribution, phylogroups, and co-resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most Gram-negative community-acquired and nosocomial infections are caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, among which increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) is a major problem. We present data from the first Danish nationwide prevalence study on ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis in blood and urine cultures from hospitals and the community. METHODS: During September and October 2007, 13 of 15 Danish departments of clinical microbiology collected data and strains. Confirmatory ESBL test-positive isolates were sent to a central laboratory for species and ESBL-phenotype confirmation, extended susceptibility testing, phylogenetic grouping of E. coli strains, and ESBL gene characterization. RESULTS: During the study, blood samples from 18,259 patients and urine samples from 47,504 patients were subjected to culture. Among 14,674 cultured isolates, 352 were confirmed to be ESBL-producers. Thus, the crude ESBL prevalence was 2.4% (range 1.5% of E. coli in community urine to 6.6% of K. pneumoniae in hospital urine). An average of 7.2 ESBL-producers per 100,000 consumed bed-days was calculated. Of the 352 reported ESBL-producers, 205 E. coli, 73 K. pneumoniae, and 1 P. mirabilis, were available for testing. CTX-M enzymes dominated, both in hospitals and in the community, occurring in 92% of E. coli and 88% of K. pneumoniae, and with CTX-M-15 constituting 60% and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to 2003 data the ESBL prevalence in Denmark has increased significantly. In the ESBL-producers, reduced susceptibility towards both gentamicin and ciprofloxacin was seen among 43% E. coli and 55% K. pneumoniae, leaving clinicians in these cases with only a carbapenem for the treatment of serious infections. Part of this study was presented at the 20(th) European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, abstract P-1617.
TI  - Using nucleic acid microarrays to perform molecular epidemiology and detect novel beta-lactamases: a snapshot of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases throughout the world.
AB  - The worldwide dissemination of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a major concern in both hospital and community settings. Rapid identification of these resistant pathogens and the genetic determinants they possess is needed to assist in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. A collection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis isolates, including phenotypically ESBL-positive (n = 1,093) and ESBL-negative isolates (n = 59), obtained in 2008-2009 from a longitudinal surveillance study (SMART) was examined using an in vitro nucleic acid-based microarray. This approach was used to detect and identify bla(ESBL) (bla(SHV), bla(TEM), and bla(CTX-M) genes of groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) and bla(KPC) genes and was combined with selective PCR amplification and DNA sequencing for complete characterization of the bla(ESBL) and bla(KPC) genes. Of the 1,093 phenotypically ESBL-positive isolates, 1,041 were identified as possessing at least one bla(ESBL) gene (95.2% concordance), and 59 phenotypically ESBL-negative isolates, used as negative controls, were negative. Several ESBL variants of bla(TEM) (n = 5), bla(SHV) (n = 11), bla(CTX-M) (n = 19), and bla(KPC) (n = 3) were detected. A new bla(SHV) variant, bla(SHV-129), and a new bla(KPC) variant, bla(KPC-11), were also identified. The most common bla genes found in this study were bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-14), and bla(SHV-12). Using nucleic acid microarrays, we obtained a "molecular snapshot" of bla(ESBL) genes in a current global population; we report that CTX-M-15 is still the dominant ESBL and provide the first report of the new beta-lactamase variants bla(SHV-129) and bla(KPC-11).
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, recommending ESBL confirmation with Etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive ESBL screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MIC >1 mg/L or an automated system ESBL warning). Twenty laboratories submitted 443 Enterobacteriaceae with a positive ESBL screen test and their confirmation test result (74%Escherichia coli, 12%Enterobacter cloacae, 8%Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%Proteus mirabilis, 2%Klebsiella oxytoca). Presence of ESBL genes was used as reference test. Accuracy of local phenotypic ESBL detection was 88%. The positive predictive value (PPV) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (Vitek-2: 69%, Phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%K. pneumoniae-27%K. oxytoca). A low PPV (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin MICs <2 mg/L. Local ESBL confirmation had a PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93% and 90%, respectively. Compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. Combination disc was more specific than Etest (91% versus 61%). Confirmation tests were not reliable for P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca (PPV 33% and 38%, respectively, although NPVs were 100%). In conclusion, performance of Etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic ESBL confirmation of P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic ESBL confirmation, and by interpreting isolates with a positive ESBL alarm but an MIC <2 mg/L for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as ESBL-negative.
TI  - French results of the ARESC study: clinical aspects and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in female patients with cystitis. Implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most frequent community infections. We report the French results of the international ARESC study on the clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. PATIENT AND METHODS: Female patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis, were investigated clinically with urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested with nine antimicrobials. RESULTS: Four thousand and four hundred patients were included, 871 in France, forming the largest national cohort. Urine culture was positive (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) in 550 (63.1%); 533 (96.9%) presented with a single bacterium infection. 488 uropathogens, collected from 479 patients, were analyzed. The most frequent were: Escherichia coli (83.8%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (3.1%), enterococci (1.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.0%). E. coli was highly susceptible to fosfomycin (99.0%) (97.1%), nitrofurantoin (97.3%), and ciprofloxacin (98.3%). The lowest susceptibility rates were found for ampicillin (60.9%) and cotrimoxazole (87.8%). Fosfomycin (97.8%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), and nitrofurantoin (91.5%) had the highest susceptibility rate. The lowest susceptibility rates were observed with ampicillin (61.4%) and cotrimoxazole (86.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin, pivmecillinam (not available in France), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) and fluoroquinolones are not usually recommended as first intention drugs for the empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis, because of increasing resistance rates.
TI  - Prevalence of 16S rRNA methylase genes in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Greek university hospital.
AB  - 16S ribosomal RNA methylase-mediated high-level resistance to 4-,6-aminoglycosides has been reported in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from several countries. Three of 1534 (0.2%) isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and three of 734 (0.4%) Proteus mirabilis isolates from a university hospital in Athens, Greece, were positive for rmtB and highly resistant to all aminoglycosides tested (MICs >/=256 mg/L). Two of the K. pneumoniae rmtB-bearing isolates, were KPC-2 and OXA-10 producers and the third was a DHA-1 producer. One of the P. mirabilis isolates was a VIM-1 and OXA-10 producer and one was an OXA-10 producer. All rmtB-harbouring isolates were clonally unrelated. None of the E. coli (n = 1398) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 414) isolates were positive for armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC or rmtD.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections in South African hospitals (SMART Study 2004-2009): impact of the new carbapenem breakpoints.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) follows trends in resistance among aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) in patients around the world. METHODS: During 2004-2009, three centralized clinical microbiology laboratories serving 59 private hospitals in three large South African cities collected 1,218 GNB from complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) and tested them for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according to the 2011 Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 83.7% of the isolates. Escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (46.4%), and 7.6% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. The highest ESBL rate was documented for Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.2%). Overall, ertapenem was the antibiotic most active against susceptible species for which it has breakpoints (94.6%) followed by amikacin (91.9%), piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3%), and imipenem-cilastatin (87.1%), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7%, 28.7%, 22.5%, and 21.1%, respectively. Multi-drug resistance (MDR), defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, was significantly more common in K. pneumoniae (27.9%) than in E. coli (4.9%; p<0.0001) or Proteus mirabilis (4.1%; p<0.05). Applying the new CLSI breakpoints for carbapenems, susceptibility to ertapenem was reduced significantly in ESBL-positive E. coli compared with ESBL-negative isolates (91% vs. 98%; p<0.05), but this did not apply to imipenem-cilastatin (95% vs. 99%; p=0.0928). A large disparity between imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem susceptibility in P. mirabilis and Morganella morganii was documented (24% vs. 96% and 15% vs. 92%, respectively), as most isolates of these two species had imipenem-cilastatin minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 2-4 mcg/mL range, which is no longer regarded as susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among GNB commonly isolated from cIAIs in South Africa. With the application of the new CLSI carbapenem breakpoints, discrepancies were noted between ertapenem and imipenem-cilastatin with regard to the changes in their individual susceptibilities. Longitudinal surveillance of susceptibility patterns is useful to guide recommendations for empiric antibiotic use in cIAIs.
TI  - [Characteristic of fluoroquinolone resistant clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae,  P. mirabilis and E. coli producing ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are the predominant mechanism for acquired antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. During the past few years, increasing occurrence of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpCs) particularly in K. pneumonia, P. mirabilis and E. coli was reported. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse of the diversity of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as pAmpCs and ESBLs among clinical K. pneumonia, P. mirabilis and E. coli strains in Poland. METHODS: A total of 19 clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains (E. coli, n = 9; K. pneumoniae, n = 7; P. mirabilis, n = 3) resistant to third-generation cephalosporin were selected from collection of fluoroquinolone resistant isolates recovered during a 6-months period in regular hospital in Warsaw, Poland. ESBLs and AmpCs were detected by using phenotypic methods: double-disc tests (DDSTs), MAST ID D68C test, sensitivity to cefoxitin, disk potentiation test (DPT) and Tris-EDTA test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the bla(AmpC), bla(CTM-M), bla(TEM), and bla(SHV), genes. PCR-products for these genes were sequenced. To determine the possible clonality of the tested isolates PFGE with the XbaI was performed. RESULTS: Nine of 19 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains tested produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of TEM, SHV and CTX-M families. These ESBLs were most commonly detected in E. coli. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 6 tested strains, including 3 isolates of P. mirabilis. The AmpC found in our study belonged to CMY and DHA families, Furthermore, 4 isolates of K. pneumoniae were found to co-produce both ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. XbaI-PFGE profiles pointed significant differences of tested strains. CONCLUSION: Horizontal transfer of genes encoding for acquired beta-lactamases such ESBL and AmpC seem to play primary role in dissemination of these resistance traits among fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae in Poland.
TI  - A self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  - This article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against bacteria. The microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of PDMS containing channels that connect the chambers. The assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by PDMS provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. During the operation of the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. The growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a pH indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. Using this device we measured the MIC of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Proteus mirabilis HI4320, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli MG1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. The device provides a simple method for MIC determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. Importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. As the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the SMART study in Spain (2002-2010).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the SMART study performed in Spain from 2002 to 2010. Isolates were recovered in 16 centres. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). Frequency of ESBL-producing isolates was: E. coli, 8.7%; K. pneumoniae, 8.4%; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and Proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. Overall, ESBL-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). Ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with EUCAST criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all Enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against ESBL producers (95.5-100%). Susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among ESBL-producing isolates. Nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in ESBL-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility data from the SMART-Spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. This is also supported by the high frequency of ESBL-producers in our geographic area.
TI  - Colonisation and infection due to Enterobacteriaceae producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of infections caused by Enterobacteria producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpC), which are emerging as a cause of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. METHODS: A prospective multicentre cohort of patients with infection/colonisation due to pAmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed in 7 Spanish hospitals from February throughout July 2009. pAmpCs were characterised by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: 140 patients were included; organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (n = 100), Proteus mirabilis (n = 20), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 17), and others (n = 3). Overall, 90% had a chronic underlying condition. The acquisition was nosocomial in 43%, healthcare-associated in 41% (14% of those were nursing home residents), and community in 16%. Only 5% of patients had no predisposing feature for infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nineteen percent of patients were bacteraemic. Inappropriate empirical therapy was administered to 81% of bacteraemic patients, who had a crude mortality rate of 48%. The most frequent enzyme was CMY-2 (70%, predominantly in E. coli and P. mirabilis) followed by DHA-1 (19%, predominantly in K. pneumoniae). CONCLUSION: pAmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae caused nosocomial, healthcare-associated and community infections mainly in predisposed patients. Invasive infections were associated with high mortality which might be partly related to inappropriate empirical therapy.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(NDM-1) gene in Gram-negative rods.
AB  - The latest threat of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in Enterobacteriacae. Five bla(NDM) (-1) -positive plasmids of different incompatibility groups (IncL/M, FII, A/C and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. Successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. Conjugation frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. Higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees C compared with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees C. Carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. None of the five plasmids was transferable to Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. This work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(NDM) (-1) gene could be among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - The effect of inappropriate therapy on bacteremia by ESBL-producing bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of empiric appropriate treatment and the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with bacteremia by E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis producing ESBL. METHODS: Data were reviewed in an 8-year retrospective study, and 128 bacteremias were found: 80 caused by E. coli (62.5%), 28 by K. pneumoniae (21.9%) and 20 by P. mirabilis (18.6%). RESULTS: The initial antibiotic treatment, administered within 72 h after the first positive blood culture, was appropriate with carbapenems or other antimicrobial agents with documented in vitro sensitivity in 53.8 and 16% of patients, respectively. The overall mortality 21 days after diagnosis was 17.2%, and it was 14.9 and 35.2% for patients adequately and inadequately treated, respectively. At univariate analysis the p value for mortality with and without appropriate treatment was 0.05, and significant differences were found only for previous positive blood cultures (p = 0.004) and presence of septic shock at diagnosis (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: In this case series there was a high rate of initial appropriate empiric treatment, and only a marginal impact on mortality was found with regard to appropriate and inappropriate treatment. This report shows that the knowledge of ESBL-producing characteristics varies widely among the different case series for reasons that still have to be clarified.
TI  - Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteremias in the emergency department.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria have been spreading from hospitals to communities. Despite this, there are limited emergency department (ED) patient-based studies about these bacteremias. A retrospective matched case-control study with a ratio of 1:3 was conducted at a university hospital. The case group consisted of patients aged >16 years with ESBL-producing bacteremias in the ED. Patients matched for age and sex with non-ESBL-producing bacteremias were sampled as the control group. Finally, 64 episodes of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis bacteremias were included in our study. The median age of case patients was 71 years, and 29 (45.3%) were males. The most common type of infection was urinary tract infection (71.9%), followed by intra-abdominal infection (12.5%). Inappropriate empirical antibiotics therapy was prescribed in 87.5% of case patients, which was significantly higher than the control group (13.0%; p < 0.001). Patients with inappropriate empirical antibiotics had a significantly longer hospital stay than those with appropriate empirical antibiotics (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that hospital-acquired infection, urinary catheterization, and previous antibiotics use were independent risk factors for the acquisition of ESBL-producing bacteremia. The 28-day mortality rate of case patients was 18.8%. Whether they received appropriate empirical antibiotics treatment or not, there was no statistical difference in the mortality of patients with ESBL-producing bacteremias (p = 0.167). To face these emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria and to guide the empirical antibiotics therapy, it is crucial for emergency physicians to recognize the characteristics and risk factors for ESBL-producing organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in Cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out between February 2005 and November 2008 at the San Buenaventura University's Clinical Laboratory in Cartagena. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the Kirby Bauer method. RESULTS: Out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. The bacterium isolated most frequently was Escherichia coli (60.1 %) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), Proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). The Gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range 84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract infections in the patients involved in this study. The most commonly isolated bacteria were E. coli. Empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compound from the leaves of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial properties of medicinal plants and plant parts such as  flowers, roots, fruits, seeds and oils are being used to cure some chronic and acute diseases throughout the world. In the present study, an attempt has been made to isolate and identify the antibacterial compound present in the leaves of the Cassia auriculata. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A preliminary screening of antibacterial activity was carried out with fine different plant extracts viz., Aegle marmelos, Chloris Virgata, Clausena anisata, Feronia limonia and Cassia auriculata against different human pathogenic bacteriae such as Escherichia coil, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae at different concentrations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, the plant Cassia auriculata was selected as the efficient plant, which shows antibacterial activity against the tested organisms. Further compound responsible for its antibacterial activity was isolated and identified by IR spectrum, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and Mass spectrum studies, as oleanolic acid, which has the molecular formula of C30H48O3.
TI  - Effective cohorting and "superisolation" in a single intensive care unit in response to an outbreak of diverse multi-drug-resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cohorting patients in dedicated hospital wards or wings during infection outbreaks reduces transmission of organisms, yet frequently, this may not be feasible because of inadequate capacity, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). We hypothesized that cohorting isolation patients in one geographic location in a single ICU and using enhanced isolation procedures ("superisolation") can prevent the further spread of highly multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO). METHODS: Six patients dispersed throughout our Surgical Trauma Burn ICU had infections with carbapenem-resistant, non-clonal gram-negative MDRO, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Providencia rettgeri. Five of the six patients also had simultaneous isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Under threat of unit closure and after all standard isolation procedures had been enacted, these six patients were moved to the front six beds of the unit, the front entrance was closed, and all traffic was redirected through the back entrance. Nursing staff were assigned to either two isolation or two non-isolation patients. In accordance with the practice of Semmelweis, rounds were conducted so as to end at the rooms of the patients with the most highly-resistant bacterial infections. RESULTS: A few months after these interventions, all six patients had been discharged from the ICU (three alive and three dead), and no new cases of infection with any of their pathogens (based on species and antibiogram) or VRE occurred. The mean ICU stay and overall hospital length of stay for these six patients were 78.3 days and 117.2 days respectively, with a mortality rate of 50%. CONCLUSION: Cohorting patients to one area and altering work routines to minimize contact with patients with MDRO (essentially designating a "high-risk" zone) may be beneficial in stopping patient-to-patient spread of highly resistant bacteria without the need for a dedicated isolation unit.
TI  - VIM and IMP metallo-beta-lactamases and other extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from environmental samples in a Tunisian hospital.
AB  - An extremely drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae species emerged in Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia between 2009 and 2010 causing a local outbreak. We aimed to characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from the hospital environment. Swabs were collected from ten different wards from Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia. A total of 46 isolates were cultured onto MacConkey agar supplemented with ceftazidime to select for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Identification and susceptibility patterns were performed using Phoenix-automated phenotypic identification criteria. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected using cefepime ESBL E-test. Colony blotting was first used to detect the occurrence of bla(SHV) , bla(CTX-M) , bla(CMY) , bla(IMP) , and bla(VIM) genes. PCR was used to amplify these genes, and the amplicons were sequenced and analyzed. Total DNA was digested with XbaI, and PFGE was used to type the major isolates that produced IMP-1. Among the 46 isolates, 63% were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13% were Escherichia coli, 8.7% were Proteus mirabilis, 6% were Enterobacter cloaceae, 4.3% were Providencia rettgeri, 2.5% were Serratia marcescens, and 2.5% were Pantoea agglomerans. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing showed that hospital environment isolates produced SHV-125, CTX-M-15, CMY-2 ESBLs, and IMP-1 and VIM-2 MBLs. PFGE typing showed the emergence of IMP-1 MBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates that were not clonal. In this study, we report the first characterization of IMP-1 and VIM-2 MBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates collected from Kasserine Hospital, Tunisia.
TI  - [Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in females--clinical aspects, aetiology and antimicrobial resistance epidemiology. Results of the ARESC (Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiological Survey on Cystitis) study in Poland and their implications for empiric therapy].
AB  - The Polish results of the international ARESC study are reported concerning clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. METHODS: Patients between 18 and 65 years with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and investigated clinically including urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antimicrobials RESULTS: In Poland a total of 212 patients were enrolled and 119 uropathogens from 118 patients were identified. Escherichia coli was the most frequent (90; 75.6%), followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5; 4.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (4; 3.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4; 3.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3; 2.5%), E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.9%) followed by mecillinam (97.8%), nitrofurantoin (92.2%), and ciprofloxacin (92.2%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (40.0%) followed by cotrimoxazole (80.0%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (97.1%), ciprofloxacin (93.1%), and nitrofurantoin (85.2%). The lowest rates were found again for ampicillin (43.2%) and cotrimoxazole (80.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that fosfomycin, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and amoxicillin/clavulanate have preserved their good in vitro activity (> 80%) against both E. coli and the total spectrum of uropathogens.
TI  - Impact of adopting minimum inhibitory concentration as the determinant of susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems in multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute has recommended that Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility to most cephalosporins and carbapenems be reported according to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) alone. We analyzed our record of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae to assess the impact of these changes. We compared susceptibilities of ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae when using the 2009 and new 2010 MIC standards. Vitek2(R) (BioMerieux), was used to assess the changes in susceptibility. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., and Escherichia coli were the major species from urine, sputum, blood, and other sterile sites. The new breakpoint for cephalosporins increased resistance in E. coli and P. mirabilis. Many Proteus categorized as resistant by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection or inferred resistance have MICs to ceftriaxone </= 1 mcg/ml. New carbapenem breakpoints increased resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The increased ceftriaxone resistance from lowering breakpoints was almost balanced by the loss of resistance in ESBL isolates with MICs </= 1 mcg/ml. MIC-based susceptibility for multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae increases the number of resistant isolates. Inferring mechanisms of resistance has a disproportionate effect on the susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to cephalosporins, and the MIC-based standard has an almost equivalent but opposite effect on Proteus mirabilis susceptibility to carbapenems.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity profile of bacterial pathogens in postoperative wound infections at a tertiary care hospital in Gujarat, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for post-operative wound infection and their antibiotic sensitivity profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational study was carried out in patients of postoperative wound infection. Samples from wound discharge were collected using a sterile swab and studied for identification of isolates by Gram stains and culture growth followed by in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing performed by disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. RESULTS: Out of 183 organisms, 126 (68.85%) isolated organisms were gram negative. Staphylococcus aureus, 48 (26.23%), was the predominant organism. S. aureus was sensitive to rifampicin (89.58%), levofloxacin (60.42%), and vancomycin (54.17%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (83.78%), gatifloxacin (51.35%), and meropenem (51.35%). Escherichia coli was sensitive to levofloxacin (72.41%) and ciprofloxacin (62.07%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (63.16%), levofloxacin (63.16%), gatifloxacin (63.16%), and linezolid (56.52%). Proteus mirabilis was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (75%) and linezolid (62.50). Proteus vulgaris was sensitive to ampicillin+sulbactam (57.14%) followed by levofloxacin (50%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an alarming increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly in the emergence of VRSA/VISA, meropenem, and third generation cephalosporin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Linezolid showing sensitivity against Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Phenolic compounds and biological activity of Kitaibelia vitifolia.
AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the antioxidant activity and efficacy of the ethanolic extract of the endemic plant species Kitaibelia vitifolia in inhibiting the growth of selected fungi and bacteria. Antimicrobial activity was tested using the broth dilution procedure for determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). MICs were determined for eight selected indicator strains. The highest susceptibility to K. vitifolia ethanolic extract among the bacteria tested was exhibited by Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (MIC=15.62 mug/mL), followed by Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 (MIC=31.25 mug/mL), and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315 (MIC=62.50 mug/mL). Of the fungi, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (MIC=15.62 mug/mL) showed the highest susceptibility, and Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404 (MIC=31.25 mug/mL) had the lowest. Results showed that K. vitifolia extract possesses antioxidant activity, with total antioxidant capacity of 75.45+/-0.68 mug of ascorbic acid/g and 50% inhibition concentration values of 47.45+/-0.55 mug/mL for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, 35.35+/-0.68 mug/mL for inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation, 95.25+/-0.52 mug/mL for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and 31.50+/-0.35 mug/mL for metal chelating activity. Total phenolics, flavonoids, condensed tannins, and gallotannins were 85.25+/-0.69 mg of gallic acid (GA)/g, 45.32+/-0.55 mg of rutin/g, 54.25+/-0.75 mg of GA/g, and 41.74+/-0.55 mg of GA/g, respectively. The phenolic composition of K. vitifolia extract was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Rosmarinic acid was found to be the dominant phenolic compound of the extract.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents.

TI  - Nosocomial infection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Northeast Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that degrade  beta-lactam antibiotics and have been reported to be an important cause of nosocomial infection in worldwide. METHODS: During 2009, 659 enterobacteria strains were isolated from different clinical specimens and tested for ESBL production. The disk approximation test, combined disk method and addition of clavulanic acid were used for phenotypic detection of the ESBL-producing strains and PCR for detection of the bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M) genes. RESULTS: Among the isolates, 125 were ESBL producers. The bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) genes were detected in 90.4% and 75% of the strains, respectively. Most strains were isolated from urine. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent organism. Microorganisms presented high resistance to the antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the need for extending ESBL detection methods to different pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family because these methods are only currently standardized by the CLSI for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. Carbapenems were the antibiotic class of choice for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Genetic features of blaNDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Genetic features associated with the bla(NDM-1) gene were investigated in 6 Escherichia coli, 7 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Proteus mirabilis, and 1 Providencia stuartii isolate of worldwide origin. Clonal diversity was observed for both E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The bla(NDM-1) gene was carried by different plasmid types (IncA/C, IncF, IncL/M, or untypeable) and was likely chromosome borne in two isolates. The bla(NDM-1) plasmids coharbored a variety of resistance determinants, including beta-lactamase genes, quinolone resistance genes, and 16S RNA methylase genes.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - [Russian results of the international epidemiological study of clinical aspects and resistance to antimicrobial medicines of cystitis uropathogens in females (ARESC): significance of empiric therapy].
AB  - A total of 656 female patients from Russia aged between 18 to 65 years with uncomplicated cystitis entered the international ARESC trial, of them 647 were eligible for final analysis. Positive cultural urine tests ( > 10(4) CFU/ml) were in 419 (64.7%) patients, 393 (93.8%) patients had monoinfection. The central laboratory of Genoa (to which the isolated samples were sent) has tested 416 uropathogens from 399 patients. The following pathogens were isolated: E. coli (72.6%), enterococcus (7.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.6%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), Proteus mirabilis (2.4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (1.7%). E. coli was most sensitive to phosphomycin (99.3%), mecillinam (97.3%), nitrofurantoin (94.7%), ciprofloxacin (87.4%). The lowest sensitivity was to ampicillin (42.1%) and cotrimoxasol (69.4%). As to the whole bacterial spectrum, the highest sensitivity was found to phosphomycin (96.5%), nitrofurantoin (85.6%) and citrofloxacin (82.8%), the less sensitivity--to ampicyllin (44.3%) and co-trimoxasol (70.1%). Phosphomycin, mecillinam (not registered in Russia) and nitrofurantoin showed activity in vitro and can be considered as drugs of choice for empiric therapy of cystitis. Because of high resistance of pathogens, co-trimoxasol (trimetoprim) and fluoroquinalones are not recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis in females.
TI  - [Clinical and economic expedience of ertapenem therapy of complicated urinary tract infection].
AB  - Clinical and economic investigation of various antibiotics use in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (CUTI) was performed under the Russian economic environment. The drugs of comparison were ertapenem, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Direct costs and their structure were shown, and the cost efficiency was calculated. Alternative analysis and one-side susceptibility analysis were performed. In complicated urinary tract infections when the major pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis it was clinically and economically reasonable to start the treatment with ceftriaxone or ertapenem, while levofloxacin could be an alternative strategy. When the effects of the acquired resistance on the treatment effectiveness were evaluated (SIS model) it was shown that the pathogens susceptibility to ertapenem was preserved for a significantly longer time than that to ceftriaxone or levofloxacin (60 months). Such a parameter may serve as an additional evidence of the reasonable use of ertapenem as the starting treatment of CUTI.
TI  - Susceptibility of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae according to the new CLSI breakpoints.
AB  - In 2010 the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) lowered the susceptibility breakpoints of some cephalosporins and aztreonam for Enterobacteriaceae and eliminated the need to perform screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and confirmatory tests. The aim of this study was to determine how many ESBL-producing strains of three common species of Enterobacteriaceae test susceptible using the new breakpoints. As determined with the CLSI screening and confirmatory tests, 382 consecutive ESBL-producing strains were collected at Huashan Hospital between 2007 and 2008, including 158 strains of Escherichia coli, 164 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 60 of Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility was determined by the CLSI agar dilution method. CTX-M-, TEM-, and SHV-specific genes were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing. bla(CTX-M) genes alone or in combination with bla(SHV) were present in 92.7% (354/382) of these ESBL-producing strains. Forty-two (25.6%) strains of K. pneumoniae harbored SHV-type ESBLs alone or in combination. No TEM ESBLs were found. Utilizing the new breakpoints, all 382 strains were resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, while 85.0 to 96.7% of P. mirabilis strains tested susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, 41.8 to 45.6% of E. coli strains appeared to be susceptible to ceftazidime and cefepime, and 20.1% of K. pneumoniae were susceptible to cefepime. In conclusion, all ESBL-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae would be reported to be resistant to cefazolin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone by using the new CLSI breakpoints, but a substantial number of ESBL-containing P. mirabilis and E. coli strains would be reported to be susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam, which is likely due to the high prevalence of CTX-M type ESBLs.

TI  - Molecular analysis of NDM-1-producing enterobacterial isolates from Geneva, Switzerland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the mechanisms responsible for decreased susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems in several enterobacterial isolates recovered in 2009-10 in Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland. METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to identify beta-lactamases, 16S RNA methylases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. The transferable properties of the plasmids were analysed, as well as their plasmid type. The strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Three patients were found to be positive for NDM-1-producing enterobacterial isolates (one with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, one with K. pneumoniae only and one with Proteus mirabilis), where NDM-1 stands for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. The bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-1, SHV-11, OXA-1, OXA-9 and OXA-10), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M-15, CMY-16 and CMY-30), ArmA and quinolone resistance determinants (Qnr). The bla(NDM-1) gene was located on conjugative IncA/C- or IncF-type plasmids. Upstream of the bla(NDM-1) gene, part of ISAba125, previously identified in NDM-1-negative Acinetobacter baumannii, was found. Downstream of the bla(NDM-1) gene, variable sequences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This work constitutes the first identification of NDM-1 producers in Switzerland. Interestingly, patients from whom these NDM-1-producing isolates were recovered had a link with the Indian subcontinent or the Balkans.
TI  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1: local acquisition in Ontario, Canada, and challenges in detection.
AB  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a recently identified metallo-beta-lactamase that confers resistance to carbapenems and all other beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of aztreonam. NDM-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in Sweden who had previously received medical treatment in India, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout India and Pakistan and has spread worldwide. The gene encoding NDM-1 has been found predominantly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We describe the isolation NDM-1-producing organisms from two patients in Toronto, Ontario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing NDM-1 that was locally acquired in Canada. We also discuss the evidence that NDM-1 can affect bacterial species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce NDM-1.
TI  - Potentiation of antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin by Pelargonium graveolens essential oil against selected uropathogens.
AB  - The recent approach of using herbs and antibiotics in combination constitutes a strategy to overcome the problems of resistance and side effects associated with conventional antibiotics. In the present study, the antimicrobial effect of Pelargonium graveolens L' Her essential oil in combination with ciprofloxacin was evaluated on uropathogens, namely, Klebsiella pneumoniae KT2, Proteus mirabilis PRT3 and Staphylococcus aureus ST2. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of P. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin were determined by the microbroth dilution method and further, the interaction between these two agents was studied by a checkerboard method. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated to be 0.375 for both K. pneumoniae KT2 and P. mirabilis PRT3, while for S. aureus ST2 it was found to be 0.5. The values of FICI for the tested microorganisms were found to be </=0.5, which indicates synergism between P. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin. The concave shaped curve in the isobolograms also depicted a synergistic effect of P. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin against the tested microorganisms. Hence, the synergistic action of P. graveolens essential oil and ciprofloxacin may be applied for the treatment of UTIs, which have hitherto been treated by using only synthetic drugs.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in Canada from 2007 to 2009:  CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - From January 2007 to December 2009, an annual Canadian national surveillance study (CANWARD) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): Escherichia coli (1,581, 54%), enterococci (410, 14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), Proteus mirabilis (122, 4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and Staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). The rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. Statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for E. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; P < 0.001) and for SXT (from 18.6 to 24.3%; P = 0.02). For isolates of E. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). Increased age was also associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and SXT) (P = 0.005). We conclude that frequently prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as SXT and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against recent clinical isolates.
TI  - [CMY-2-type plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases emerging in Tucuman, Argentina].
AB  - In the last years, Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, have acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G) because of the presence of plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases. The aim of this work was to detect plasmid AmpC enzymes and to investigate the predominant types in our region. Between March and July 2009, 733 consecutive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae derived from hospitals and outpatient centers were studied. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion; one P. mirabilis and three E. coli strains showed resistance to cephamycins (cefoxitin) and C3G. An E-test to determine MIC and a synergy test by aminophenylboronic disks were performed. Enzymatic activity against cefoxitin was confirmed by a microbiological assay. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampC genes of different groups was performed and a 462-bp amplicon was obtained when using primers directed against the CIT group; the obtained sequences were compared to blaCMY-2 sequences, showing 100% identity. The emergence of CMY-2-type plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases indicated the importance of implementing systematic monitoring of these resistances to avoid potential clinical and epidemiological consequences.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Proteus
AB  - The Gram-negative bacilli of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter,and Proteus(Table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. With the exception of Proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. Many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. Today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (R factors). Also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host defenses.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - Confirmation of HIV-like sequences in respiratory tract bacteria of Cambodian and Kenyan HIV-positive pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and yeasts isolated from respiratory tracts of 39 Cambodian  and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children were tested for the presence of HIV-1 sequences. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract (nose, pharyngeal swabs) were isolated from 39 Cambodian and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard protocol and by Qiagen kit. The PCR specific for HIV sequences was carried out using HIV-1-specific primers.The analysis was performed by colony and dot-blot hybridization using HIV-1-specific primers which represent gag, pol and env genes of the virus. The sequencing of some PCR products was performed on the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer. RESULTS: The majority of microbes were characterized as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resp. Candida albicans. In some cases E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Candida tropicalis were identified. Bacteria of 16 Cambodian (41%) and 8 Kenyan (31%) children were found to be positive in colony and dot-blot DNA hybridization. By the sequencing of PCR products synthesized on the template of patients' bacterial DNA using primers 68;69 for env HIV-1 gene, homology of greater than 90% with HIV-1 isolate HXB2 (HIVHXB2CG) was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract of 41% of Cambodian and 31% of Kenyan HIV-positive children bear HIV-like sequences. The role of bacteria in the HIV disease process is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide A3-APO in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  - Although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide A3-APO has only modest activity against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with conventional antibiotics. In this study, the efficacy of A3-APO in several additional mouse models was investigated, including Staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed Klebsiella pneumoniae-A. baumannii-Proteus mirabilis wound infection and K. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. Whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. In the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following A3-APO treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. The wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A3-APO upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. One of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.
TI  - Thrombocytes are effectors of the innate immune system releasing human beta defensin-3.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocyte concentrate i.e. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a  popular adjunct for many surgical procedures. It is believed to improve bone and soft tissue healing. Recently antimicrobial effects of the autologous preparation were reported by several groups. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial effect of PRP against gram-negative microbes which frequently cause severe complications in orthopaedic trauma surgery. METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma was produced from liquid preserved thrombocyte concentrates. ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were preformed to investigate the release and content of platelet concentrates. A radial diffusion assay was used to detect antimicrobial effects of PRP. RESULTS: We detected the human beta defensin-3 in bactericidal concentrations in platelet preparations by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In antimicrobial testing we demonstrated effective inhibition of Escherichia coli (ATCC 11303), Bacterium megaterium (ATCC 14581), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC21100). CONCLUSION: With this study we demonstrate antimicrobial action of a popular adjunct for orthopaedic and trauma surgery against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We have identified a possible mechanism of action via the secretion of HBD-3 as a first line defence in contaminated wounds and in elective application of PRP. This finding supports a broader spectrum of clinical indications for an autologous platelet preparation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.

TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - The nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.
AB  - This study was conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout Japan between January 2008 and June 2008. A total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. The strains investigated in this study are as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), Escherichia coli (n = 255), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Serratia marcescens (n = 44), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Although a majority of the E. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and S. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. The proportions of E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%, and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. These data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.
TI  - [Comparison of four phenotypic methods to detect extended-spectrum betalactamases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of four phenotypic methods for the identification of strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases isolated from urine cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative cross-sectional study. 147 strains isolated from positive urine cultures for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis between January and February 2009 in the National Institute of Health of Children underwent a screening test, those which resulted positive were processed for confirmatory testing through the four phenotypic methods evaluated. RESULTS: Out of the 147 strains, 43 (29.3%) were suspicious in the screening tests. Using the method described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) as a reference standard for this study, 27 strains (62.8%) were positive, with similar results using Jarlier's method. On the other hand, using Hodge's and tridimensional methods 23 (53.5%) of samples were positive. The evaluation of the confirmation methods in comparison to the one described by CLSI, showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for Jarlier's method, on the other hand, for Hodge's and tridimensional methods we found a sensitivity of 85.2% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All the evaluated methods showed a high efficacy, without significant differences, so they could all be used according to the available facilities of each clinical laboratory. Nevertheless, due to its advantages besides the technical aspect, like costs, easiness and feasibility of its application, we recommend the use of Jarlier's method.
TI  - [Occurrence of 16s rRNA methylase ArmA producing Enterobacteriaceae in a general  hospital in Warsaw, Poland].
AB  - Resistance to gentamicin, amikacin and kanamycin was screened in 270 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae originated from April 19 to May 19, 2010 in a regular hospital in Warsaw, Poland. Most of the isolated bacteria were considered pathogenic. Nineteen isolates (7%) were simultaneously resistant to two or three of the tested aminoglycosides. MICs of the three aminoglycosides ranged form 128 to 1024 mcg/ml for six isolates. These isolates were suspected to produce 16S rRNA methylase. Genes encoding for three methylases reported in Europe: ArmA, RmtB and RmtC were searched by PCR. The armA gene was detected in all of the six isolates. This group encompassed Enterobacter cloacae (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). Five isolates of this group carried the bla(CAX-M) gene for CTX-M type ESBL. The remaining isolate E. cloacae DM0340 was ESBL negative and lacked bla(CRX-M) that may suggest an altered genetic environment of the armA gene in this isolate. Our results showed that 2.2% of the tested isolates produced 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. This finding may argue for a high incidence of ArmA producing Enterobacteriaceae in Poland when compared to reports from other European countries.
TI  - [Epidemiological and bacteriological characteristics of uropathogen bacteria isolated in a pediatric environment].
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is a grave pathology, which requires a  fast and effective care. Bacteriological and epidemiological data play a determining role in patient's care. We report a retrospective study, which spreads out from January 1st till August 31st, 2009, having concerned hospitalized children for urinary infection in pediatrics service of Farhat Hached teaching hospital in Sousse. Our series contained 51 children with a sex ratio of 0.76, an average age of 32 months. The majority of cases was pyelonephritis (94.1%). A pathology is associated with the urinary infection in 41.2%. Three cases of vesico-ureteral reflux were noted. The diagnosis of urinary infection was confirmed by cytobacteriological exam of urine (CBEU). Enterobacteriacea were isolated in 96.1%. Escherichia coli remains the most often isolated (80.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%) then by Proteus mirabilis (5.9%). E. coli was resistant to amoxicillin in 78% of cases, to the association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in 64,8%, to cephalosporins of 3(rd) generation (C3G) in 5% and to cotrimoxazole in 51%. No K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis strain was resistant to C3G. UTI in children is always an indication for CBEU realization at first intention. The results of this exam are very important considering the diversity of the responsible bacteria and the growing frequency of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Proteus mirabilis in Hangzhou, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenems are used to treat severe infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, however, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial isolates is becoming an increasing therapeutic challenge. Since the first Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae was reported in 2001, KPC-producing isolates have been found increasingly, specially in Enterobacteriaceae. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of a carbapenem-resistant Proteus (P.) mirabilis. METHODS: A carbapenem-resistant P. mirabilis isolate was recovered from pleural drainage fluid of a patient admitted to surgical intensive care unit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed by disk diffusion according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, and subsequent minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined with the E-test. Amplification of the bla(KPC) gene generated a positive band and the PCR products were sequenced subsequently. The plasmid of the isolate was extracted and was successfully transformed into Escherichia (E.) coli DH5alpha. RESULTS: The P. mirabilis isolate was resistant to all detected antimicrobial agents except tigecycline. KPC-2 was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The transformant E. coli was resistant to carbapenems. Further study demonstrated that upstream and downstream regions of bla(KPC-2) were identical to that observed in K. pneumoniae submitted to GenBank from China in 2007. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistance in the P. mirabilis isolate in this study is mainly due to production of KPC-2.
TI  - Incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in Nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. OBJECTIVE: This study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. METHODS: A microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between March 2004 and May 2005 was performed. Relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. Definitions of infections were based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Criteria. In the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. S. aureus, Coagulase negative staphylococcus (CNS), and Enterobacter spp were cultured from the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. Eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with CNS (32), S. aureus (28), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), E. coli (5), Corynebacterium species (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with CNS on 2 occasions. Seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured Staphylococcus species in their nares. Four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. Facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. Most items were heat sterilized. Cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. The choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. The ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. Staffs were not protected when handling linen. Infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. They were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. The only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. All waste types were stored together prior to final disposal away from the public. CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. Other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. Areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.
TI  - Three enzymatic steps required for the galactosamine incorporation into core lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The core lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Proteus mirabilis as well as those of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens are characterized by the presence of a hexosamine-galacturonic acid disaccharide (alphaHexN-(1,4)-alphaGalA) attached by an alpha1,3 linkage to L-glycero-D-manno-heptopyranose II (L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptosepyranose II). In K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and some P. mirabilis strains, HexN is D-glucosamine, whereas in other P. mirabilis strains, it corresponds to D-galactosamine. Previously, we have shown that two enzymes are required for the incorporation of D-glucosamine into the core LPS of K. pneumoniae; the WabH enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to outer core LPS, and WabN catalyzes the deacetylation of the incorporated GlcNAc. Here we report the presence of two different HexNAc transferases depending on the nature of the HexN in P. mirabilis core LPS. In vivo and in vitro assays using LPS truncated at the level of galacturonic acid as acceptor show that these two enzymes differ in their specificity for the transfer of GlcNAc or GalNAc. By contrast, only one WabN homologue was found in the studied P. mirabilis strains. Similar assays suggest that the P. mirabilis WabN homologue is able to deacetylate both GlcNAc and GalNAc. We conclude that incorporation of d-galactosamine requires three enzymes: Gne epimerase for the generation of UDP-GalNAc from UDP-GlcNAc, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (WabP), and LPS:HexNAc deacetylase.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intra-abdominal gram-negative bacilli from Europe: SMART Europe 2008.
AB  - As part of the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), a total of 3,030 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from intra-abdominal infections were collected from 43 hospital centres from 13 European countries during 2008. Of 51 species, the most commonly isolated species were Escherichia coli (49.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.6%). Respectively, 17.9%, 11.6%, 5.5% and 4.5% of K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and K. oxytoca were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibilities were determined using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints. The most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were amikacin, ertapenem and imipenem. Overall, with the exception of the carbapenems, most agents exhibited dramatically reduced susceptibilities against ESBL-positive and multi-drug-resistant isolates.
TI  - [The bacteriological profile of bacteriuria in residents of a long-term geriatric facility].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known on the bacteriological profile of consecutive urine samples in elderly patients institutionalized in nursing homes. AIM: This retrospective study aims to characterize urinary pathogens, rates of isolation of the same pathogen in subsequent urine samples and predicting factors associated with such repeated isolations. Data were retrospectively retrieved from medical charts of nursing home patients during a four-year period. The authors looked for changes in rates of positive cultures, changes in urine flora, in rates of repeated isolation of the same pathogens and the possible interrelations with the use of antibiotics. METHODS: A total number of 3229 urine cultures were studied, 1311 of which (43%) were positive and 493 out of these positive cultures (37.6%) were treated with antibiotics. The rates of positive cultures increased consistently during the study period (p=0.003). E. coli (68.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis accounted for more than 90% of positive cultures. RESULTS: There was no difference with regard to pathogen types isolated from symptomatic or asymptomatic cases. The rates of recurrent bacteriuria, by the same pathogen isolated at baseline urine culture, were similar in treated and untreated cases. A regression analysis aiming to predict factors associated with subsequent positive cultures had negative results, except for cases of untreated bacteriuria with pseudomonas (CI 1.36-7.09, O.R. 3.11, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data support earlier studies underscoring the need to carefully consider the role of antibiotics and for better clinical guidelines for the treatment of bacteriuria in this population.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a group of plasmid-mediated, diverse, complex and rapidly evolving enzymes that are posing a major therapeutic challenge today in the treatment of hospitalized and community-based patients. Infections due to ESBL producers range from uncomplicated urinary tract infections to life-threatening sepsis. Derived from the older TEM is derived from Temoniera, a patient from whom the strain was first isolated in Greece. beta-lactamases, these enzymes share the ability to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid. In addition, ESBL-producing organisms exhibit co-resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, resulting in limitation of therapeutic option. Because of inoculum effect and substrate specificity, their detection is also a major challenge. At present, however, organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) provide guidelines for the detection of ESBLs in Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. In common to all ESBL-detection methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against ESBL-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence of clavulanic acid. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. ESBLs represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in the face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Thus there is need for efficient infection-control practices for containment of outbreaks; and intervention strategies, e.g., antibiotic rotation to reduce further selection and spread of these increasingly resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (ARESC Study): implications on empiric therapy].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study (ARESC) in 9 Spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. RESULTS: Of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. A positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. Of the 650 pathogens isolated, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%). E. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). Fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). E. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, E. coli shows high resistance rates to widely used antimicrobial antibiotics. Phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. Taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.
TI  - Clinical and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a long-term study from Japan.
AB  - The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in Japan are very low ( approximately 5%) compared with those obtained worldwide. Further, the current trend of these bacteria in Japan is not known, and few studies with longitudinal observations have been reported. To obtain epidemiologic data on ESBL-producing bacteria, their genotypic features, and their antibiotic resistance patterns in Japan, we analyzed bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients at our institution over the 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. Of 2,304 isolates, 202 (8.8%) were found to be ESBL producers, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis. The detection rates of the ESBL-producing isolates gradually increased and reached 17.1% and 10.5% for the E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively, in 2009. Genotyping analysis showed that approximately 90% of the ESBL-producing isolates carried the CTX-M genotype, in which the CTX-M-9 group was predominant, although the CTX-M-2 group is considered to be the main genotype in Japan; further, many of the strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. The detection rates of ESBL-producing bacteria may tend to be high within a limited region in Japan. A countrywide survey is required to understand the trend for ESBL-producing bacteria at the national level. In addition, our findings suggest that the genotypes of the detected ESBL producers are similar to those exhibiting a successful nosocomial spread worldwide.
TI  - Prevalence and resistance patterns of extended-spectrum and AmpC beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella serovar Stanley in a Korean tertiary hospital.
AB  - A total of 100 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 35), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 63), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Salmonella serovar Stanley (n = 1), showing resistance to cefoxitin, or returning positive in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ESBL confirmatory method, were studied. The isolates were examined by the boronic acid (BA) disk test, polymerase chain reaction, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate genetic similarities. The concurrence rates for ESBLs by the CLSI and the BA disk test were 97% for E. coli and 96.7% for K. pneumoniae. A total of 41 isolates showing cefoxitin resistance yielded all positive by the BA disk test. All the 33 K. pneumoniae isolates, which showed positive by the BA disk test, were carrying AmpC genes. The TEM and CTX-M types were predominant in E. coli and the SHV and the CIT and/or DHA types were predominant in K. pneumoniae. PFGE analysis showed almost 75% of genetic similarities among K. pneumoniae isolates producing ESBLs and/or AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpCs) as each K. pneumoniae carried variable genes and showed variable antibiotic patterns. Clearly, the BA disk test was a useful method for the detection of ESBLs and AmpCs. In particular, cefoxitin resistance and BA-positive trait of K. pneumoniae do reflect the presence of AmpC genes in the organism.

TI  - Enterobacteriaceae act in concert with the gut microbiota to induce spontaneous and maternally transmitted colitis.
AB  - Disruption of homeostasis between the host immune system and the intestinal microbiota leads to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether IBD is instigated by individual species or disruptions of entire microbial communities remains controversial. We characterized the fecal microbial communities in the recently described T-bet(-/-) xRag2(-/-) ulcerative colitis (TRUC) model driven by T-bet deficiency in the innate immune system. 16S rRNA-based analysis of TRUC and Rag2(-/-) mice revealed distinctive communities that correlate with host genotype. The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis correlates with colitis in TRUC animals, and these TRUC-derived strains can elicit colitis in Rag2(-/-) and WT adults but require a maternally transmitted endogenous microbial community for maximal intestinal inflammation. Cross-fostering experiments indicated a role for these organisms in maternal transmission of disease. Our findings illustrate how gut microbial communities work in concert with specific culturable colitogenic agents to cause IBD.
TI  - [Analysis of drug resistance and risk factors of Enterobacteriaceae in burn units].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae that infected burn patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on clinical information of 92 patients with Enterobacteriaceae infection in our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2008. The distribution and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, and the detection rate, drug resistance of ESBL-producing strains, and its risk factors of nosocomial infection were analyzed. Data were processed with Chi-square test. RESULTS: One hundred and nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated, with 38 (34.9%) strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 25 (22.9%) strains of Escherichia coli, 22 (20.2%) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 (11.9%) strains of Proteus mirabilis, and 11 (10.1%) other strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacteriaceae were moderately or highly resistant to antibiotics except imipenem, resistance rate of which was less than 8.0%. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 44.0% in Escherichia coli, and 77.3% in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Drug-resistance rate of ESBL-producing strains to antibiotics was obviously higher than that of non ESBL-producing strains. Length of hospital stay longer than 20 days, and use of the third-generation cephalosporin longer than 5 days, quinolone antibiotics longer than 7 days, and topical antibiotics longer than 5 days were the risk factors of nosocomial infection caused by ESBL-producing strains, comparing with non ESBL-producing strains, the difference was statistically significant (with chi2 value respectively 5.491, 4.441, 15.186, 4.938, P values all below 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae strains in burn unit of our hospital are highly drug resistant, with high lactamase-producing rates, calling for intense monitor to control the risk factors that predispose the infection of ESBL-producing strains in order to lower the infection rate.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega].
AB  - The urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. Urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. From February 2008 to January 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. From these cultures 1037 were positive. From this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. In bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. It was verified that the most frequent microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that Escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. For Klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and Enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. In conclusion, this study shows that Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. Therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. A periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Functional identification of the Proteus mirabilis core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes.
AB  - In this study, we report the identification of genes required for the biosynthesis of the core lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of two strains of Proteus mirabilis. Since P. mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae share a core LPS carbohydrate backbone extending up to the second outer-core residue, the functions of the common P. mirabilis genes was elucidated by genetic complementation studies using well-defined mutants of K. pneumoniae. The functions of strain-specific outer-core genes were identified by using as surrogate acceptors LPSs from two well-defined K. pneumoniae core LPS mutants. This approach allowed the identification of two new heptosyltransferases (WamA and WamC), a galactosyltransferase (WamB), and an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (WamD). In both strains, most of these genes were found in the so-called waa gene cluster, although one common core biosynthetic gene (wabO) was found outside this cluster.
TI  - Laboratory surveillance for prospective plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in  the Kinki region of Japan.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PABLs), and plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamases confer resistance to many beta-lactams. In Japan, although several reports exist on the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases, the prevalence and characteristics of PABLs remain unknown. To investigate the production of PABLs, a total of 22,869 strains of 4 enterobacterial species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis, were collected during six 6-month periods from 17 clinical laboratories in the Kinki region of Japan. PABLs were detected in 29 (0.13%) of 22,869 isolates by the 3-dimensional test, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing analysis. PABL-positive isolates were detected among isolates from 13 laboratories. Seventeen of 13,995 (0.12%) E. coli isolates, 8 of 5,970 (0.13%) K. pneumoniae isolates, 3 of 1,722 (0.17%) K. oxytoca isolates, and 1 of 1,182 (0.08%) P. mirabilis isolates were positive for PABLs. Of these 29 PABL-positive strains, 20 (69.0%), 6 (20.7%), 2 (6.9%), and 1 (3.4%) carried the genes for CMY-2, DHA-1, CMY-8, and MOX-1 PABLs, respectively. Pattern analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that the prevalence of CMY-2-producing E. coli strains was not due to epidemic strains and that 3 DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae strains were identical, suggesting their clonal relatedness. In conclusion, the DHA-1 PABLs were predominantly present in K. pneumoniae strains, but CMY-2 PABLs were predominantly present in E. coli strains. The present findings will provide significant information to assist in preventing the emergence and further spread of PABL-producing bacteria.
TI  - Selective strategy for urethral catheterization in febrile young girls to confirm urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of bacterial infections in childhood. Making a proper diagnosis is important but requires invasive urine collection techniques. We aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to identify non-toilet-trained febrile girls at high risk for UTIs to restrict urethral catheterizations (UCs) to this high-risk group of patients. METHODS: We included all non-toilet-trained girls with a positive microscopic urinalysis from urine collected by sterile bag in a prospective cohort study to derive a model to predict UTI assessed by urine culture from UC. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. Absence of another source of fever on examination and the child's unusual behaviour were found to be independent predictors of UTI. The corresponding model offered an 85% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 56-96], with a 59% specificity (95% CI: 30-83) for UTI. The internal cross-validation by bootstrap led to an 85% sensitivity (95% CI: 68-100), and a 59% specificity (95% CI: 35-83). CONCLUSION: We derived a clinical decision model to selectively identify young febrile girls at high risk for UTI with a positive microscopic analysis and propose UC with an 85% sensitivity, which would avoid approximately 60% of unnecessary UCs; although further validation is necessary before daily clinical use.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - [Dynamics of acquires resistance in the main gramnegative pathogens of surgical infections to beta-lactams in 2004-2008].
AB  - Resistance of 2134 clinical isolates of etiologically significant species of gramnegative bacteria to 5 beta-lactam antibiotics, i. e. cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and ceftazidime (the 3rd generation cephalosporin) as the reference drug was investigated for the period of 5 years (2004-2008). In total, 554 strains of E. coli, 578 strains of P. aeruginosa, 255 strains of Acinetobacter spp., 161 strains of Proteus mirabilis, 359 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 227 strains of Enterobacter cloacae were assayed in dynamics. The comparative analysis of the frequency of the antibiotic resistant isolates from the patients treated within 2004-2008 with often and long-term use of cefoperazom-sulbactam, meropenem and imipenem revealed an increase in development of resistance to all beta-lactams, including the inhibitor-protected ones. It least of all concerned imipenem, still isolation of 39.5% of the imipenem resistant strains of P. aeruginosa was in favour of the tendency. A dramatic 3-5-fold rise of resistance in 2007 and 2008 in the isolates of K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and Acinetobacter spp. to both the inhibitor-protected beta-lactams, that averaged 56 and 45%, 45 and 35% and 26 and 30% respectively, deserved attention. It was assumed that the main mechanism of resistance in the isolates to the inhibitor-protected beta-lactams was hyperproduction of beta-lactamase of type CTX-M. The large part of the cefepime resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. (76.8 and 62.2% respectively) was in favour of the assumption. It was concluded that periodical reversion of the policy of preventive antibiotic prophylaxis was necessary, since such a prophylaxis is a reliable barrier to development of postoperative complications and at the same time it promotes selection of nosocomial strains with some other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance under hospital conditions.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded blaCMY-2 located on a novel SXT/R391-related integrating conjugative element in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  - Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. Although SXT/R391-related ICEs, originally demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates, have become prevalent among V. cholerae isolates in Asia, the prevalence of the ICEs among gram-negative bacteria other than Vibrio spp. remains unknown. In addition, SXT/R391-related ICEs carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. Here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, TUM4660, which revealed the presence of a novel SXT/R391-related ICE, ICEPmiJpn1. ICEPmiJpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of R391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of R391, while an IS10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(CMY-2) was integrated into the ICE. A nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of ISEcp1 was located upstream of the bla(CMY-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(CMY-2) in earlier studies were also present. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in ICEPmiJpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in SXT(MO10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in P. mirabilis ATCC 29906, respectively. ICEPmiJpn1 was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. These observations suggest that ICEs may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ICEs, including SXT/R391-related ICEs.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two Croatian hospitals: MYSTIC study results.
AB  - The meropenem yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. We now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective Gram-negative pathogen groups from two Croatian Hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. A total of 1510 Gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI.There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. Acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant Gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. Almost 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli was 10% and in K. pneumoniae 49%. PCR and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of SHV-5 in nine E. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. Five K. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(SHV-5 )gene. Eight ESBL positive Enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and CtX-m beta-lactamases. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were not found among K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter spp. Three A. baumannii strains from Zagreb University Center were identified by multiplex PCR as OXA-58 like producers. Six A. baumannii strains from Split University Center were found to possess an ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(OXA-51 )gene. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. These data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for A. Baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Detection of bla(CTX-M) beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - Widespread production of CTX-M type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in Enterobacteriaceae strains which are resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the most remarkable example for rapid and global spread of plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. Consecutive 200 ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae strains out of 1640 isolates that were obtained from clinical samples (167 urine, 11 wound, 7 bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 peritoneal fluid, 2 cerebrospinal fluid, 2 biopsy, 2 tracheal aspirate, 2 conjunctiva, 1 abscess, 1 catheter) between February to July 2009 in our laboratory were included to this study. Among the 200 ESBL positive isolates 141 (70.5%) were Escherichia coli, 51 (26%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 (2.5%) were Enterobacter spp. and one of each (0.5%) Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. ESBL positivity was 11% among the 123 community-acquired strains and 13% among the 77 hospital acquired strains, the statistical difference being insignificant (p > 0.05). The prevalence of bla(CTX-M) beta-lactamase genes were detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with the use of two general primer sets: CTX-MA1 and CTX-MA2 primers for the amplification of CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-9 enzymes group, and CTX825-F and CTX825-R primers for the amplification of CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-25 enzymes group. bla(CTX-M) genes were detected in 167 out of 200 strains (83.5%). CTX-M production rates in community and hospital acquired strains were found as 86.2% and 79.2%, respectively and no statistically significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). CTX-M producing strains were either E. coli (n = 132) or Klebsiella spp. (n = 35) and were expressing one of the enzymes from CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 or CTX-M-9 groups. No strains carrying CTX-M-8 or CTX-M-25 group enzymes were detected. CTX-M production rates in ESBL producing E. coli strains in community and hospital were found as 92.5% and 95.7%, respectively, whereas the same rates for ESBL producing Klebsiella spp. strains were 67.8% and 66.7%. The difference between the CTX-M production rates of community and hospital acquired strains was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In conclusion, CTX-M prevalence was found high in ESBL producing strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Since bla(CTX-M) gene acquisition usually results in the emergence of multiple drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, screening for CTX-M type ESBL production in the laboratory has an important impact on monitoring the resistant strains which have endemic potential.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefditoren and other antimicrobials against Enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a Spanish nationwide multicenter study.
AB  - Cefditoren is a third-generation orally administered cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. After an oral 400-mg single dose, the mean concentrations in urine are 186.5 mg/L at 2 to 4 h and 12.7 mg/L at 8 to 12 h, and it is a potential drug to be used in the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). We performed a multicenter nationwide study in Spain in order to determine the in vitro activity of cefditoren and other comparative agents against Enterobacteriaceae causing community-acquired uncomplicated UTI in women. From June 2008 to March 2009, 89 institutions participated in the study. A total of 2152 Enterobacteriaceae were collected and sent to a coordinating laboratory where identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 20 antimicrobials using an automated microdilution method (MicroScan; Siemens, Sacramento, CA). Cefditoren MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines) using the same inoculum. Microorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli (81.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.9%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and others (5.1%). A total of 51 isolates (2.4%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 3 (0.1%) produced plasmidic AmpC enzymes, and 64 (2.9%) produced chromosomal AmpC. The MIC(50)/MIC(90) (mg/L) of cefditoren against all isolates was 0.12/0.5. Cefditoren inhibited 96.5% of isolates at 1 mg/L and was uniformly active against all isolates with the exception of strains producing ESBLs or AmpC enzymes. The MIC(50)/MIC(90) of other antimicrobials were ampicillin (AMP) >16/>16, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/C) <or=8/4/16/8, cefuroxime (FUR) <or=4/8, cefotaxime <or=1/<or=1, ciprofloxacin (CIP) <or=0.12/>2, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SxT) <or=2/38/>4/76, and fosfomycin (FOS) <or=16/<or=16. The respective percentages of resistance were 61%, 17.2%, 5.5%, 2.3%, 20.2%, 27.4%, and 4.8%. The activity of cefditoren against Enterobacteriaceae producing community-acquired uncomplicated UTI in women was superior to that of AMP, A/C, FUR, CIP, and SxT and similar to that of FOS.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative nonurinary bacteria to fosfomycin and other antimicrobials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary Gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of Greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. We retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all Gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (January-December 2008). RESULTS: A total of 594 nonurinary Gram-negative isolates were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) Enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) Gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other Gram-negative bacteria. In total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, all Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella species isolates were susceptible. Additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) Klebsiella pneumoniae (including carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) Enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). Isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). CONCLUSION: In a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance, fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates. These data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections: prevalence  and risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the agents causing community-acquired urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and their resistance patterns and to investigate risk factors for ESBL production. MATERIAL/METHODS: Patients diagnosed at the Department of Infectious Diseases in the Cukurova University School of Medicine Hospital with CAUTI between January 2006 and April 2007 were included prospectively. Patient data were recorded and the microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns were evaluated by the university's central microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total 146 patients with CAUTIs, 109 women and 37 men (mean age: 50.9+/-18.44 years), were included in the study. The most common infectious agents were Escherichia coli (76.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Proteus mirabilis (4.1%), and Enterococcus spp. (1.6%). The ciprofloxacin resistance rate for E. coli was 35% and resistance to TMP-SMZ 43%, whereas amikacin resistance was substantially low (3%). Four of 12 K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 2 to TMP-SMZ. Resistance to amikacin was not found in the K. pneumoniae strains. ESBL production was identified in 25 of the 112 E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. A history of a UTI within the last 6 months (p=0.029) and a history of frequent UTI (p=0.028) were found to be significant risk factors for ESBL production by univariate analysis. The only independent risk factor was a history of urinary system infection in the past 6 months (p=0.025) according to multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These high resistance rates to antimicrobials and particularly the extremely high rate of ESBL production in CAUTI should be carefully considered.
TI  - Assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for P. aeruginosa infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. A very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. Due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, whether fosfomycin resistance in P. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for P. aeruginosa. We also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. As concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. The probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. While the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: We have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for P. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. This study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.
TI  - [Characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. To assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients, in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. Of these, 106 came from patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. The sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using ROC curves. RESULTS: Positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. Within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (MMC) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). The microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was Escherichia coli, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. In the ICU subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was Enterococcus faecalis, followed by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. Specificity was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the ICU group. The groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with MMC and spinal cord injuries. Sensitivity and specificity (as measured using ROC curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).
TI  - Pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis to brown tree frogs (Litoria ewingii).
AB  - Bacterial dermatosepticemia, a systemic infectious bacterial disease of frogs, can be caused by several opportunistic gram-negative bacterial species including Aeromonas hydrophila, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia liquifaciens. Here we determined the pathogenicity of 3 bacterial species (Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) associated with an outbreak of fatal dermatosepticemia in New Zealand Litoria ewingii frogs. A bath challenge method was used to expose test frogs to individual bacterial species (2 x 10(7) cfu/mL in pond water); control frogs were exposed to uninfected pond water. None of the control frogs or those exposed to A. hydrophila or P. mirabilis showed any morbidity or mortality. Morbidity and mortality was 40% among frogs exposed to K. pneumonia, and the organism was reisolated from the hearts, spleens, and livers of affected animals.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Distinct bacterial colonization patterns of Escherichia coli subtypes associate with rheumatoid factor status in early inflammatory arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of RA is unknown; however, bacterial exposure, particularly to Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has been linked to disease pathogenesis. The strongest association was observed for RF(+) RA. We compare colonization patterns of these bacteria, and the anti-bacterial antibody levels in early onset RF(+) and RF(-) inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Bacteria isolated from stool and urine of early-stage RF(+) and RF(-) patients recruited to the Early Arthritis Registry were biochemically identified and genotyped. IgM and IgA anti-bacterial and RF antibodies were assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: Differences in the types of colonizing pathogenic E. coli were identified. RF(+) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic Group D E. coli, whereas RF(-) patients were more commonly colonized with phylogenetic Group B2 E. coli and these individuals also had lower joint scores and inflammatory markers yet higher IgA anti-E. coli antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: These studies link the type of colonizing bacteria in the gut and urine with the immune response (anti-bacterial and RF) in early-onset inflammatory arthritis and provide evidence for a role of the host-pathogen response in the aetiology of RF.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase Detection in Gram-negative Bacilli of Nosocomial Origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. The presence of ESBL producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from June 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection. The isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. Gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for ESBL by double disc synergy test (DDST- a screening test)and then phenotypic confirmatory test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: From the sample of 238 gram-negative bacilli, we isolated Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter cloacae. Following both methods, 34% isolates were ESBL-positive. The ESBL producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-ESBL producers. Multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in ESBL positive isolates than non-ESBL isolates (21.66%). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of ESBL in our hospital cannot be ignored. ESBL producers can be detected by DDST and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. The sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. We recommend DDST using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Use of the cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in AmpC co-producing bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) may not always be detected  in routine susceptibility tests. This study reports the performance of the cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest for the detection of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae, including those producing AmpC enzyme. METHODOLOGY: Consecutive non-duplicate isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from bloodstream infections from January to June 2008 were tested for ESBL by both the standard CLSI double-disk diffusion method using ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks and Etests using ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate and cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate gradients. Isolates were also tested for the presence of transferable AmpC beta-lactamase by AmpC disk test and the efficacies of the different Etests in detecting ESBL production were compared. RESULTS: A total of 113 bacterial isolates (61 K. pneumoniae, 50 E. coli, and 2 P. mirabilis) were recovered. Respectively, 42 (37.2%) and 55 (48.7%) isolates were positive for ESBL by the ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime-clavulanate combined disk tests. The cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate Etest strip detected the maximum number of isolates (70/113, 61.9 %) as ESBL-positive compared to the ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanate and cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanate strips, which detected 57 (50.4%) isolates each as ESBL-positive. All three ESBL Etest strips were equally effective in detecting ESBL in the isolates that were AmpC negative. In the 66 (58.4%) isolates that co-produced AmpC in addition to the ESBL enzymes, cefepime/cefepime-clavulanate Etest strip detected ESBL in an additional 13 (11.4%) isolates as compared to the other ESBL Etest strips. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest is a suitable substitute to test for ESBL production, especially in organisms producing AmpC beta-lactamases.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  - The identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ESBL-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. Patients with travellers' diarrhoea (N = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia or Campylobacter, were also examined for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The overall prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). Of the patients who had travelled in Europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be ESBL carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside Europe. ESBL-producing E. coli was especially common among patients returning from India (11/14), Egypt (19/38; 50%) and Thailand (8/38; 22%). In total, 90% of the genes of the ESBL-positive samples were of CTX-M type. The CTX-M-1 group dominated, followed by the CTX-M-9 group. The repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the ESBL strains found. Patients who have travelled outside Europe are at high risk of being colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Autoimmune diseases: Solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  - Autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. These are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. Here we describe these components and how they interact. Known microbial triggers are Streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, Proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and Klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. The immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is caused by loss of suppressor T cells. This leaves Burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in Graves' disease, as the immunological defect. With wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. This dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (H Gene Theory). We show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. Because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically. Isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. Kaplans's discovery that xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Frequency of resistance and susceptible bacteria isolated from houseflies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we determine the vector competence of Musca domestica  with reference to the transmission of susceptible and resistance bacterial strains in hospitals and slaughter house in Sanandaj City, west Iran. METHODS: Totally 908 houseflies were collected to isolate bacteria from their external body based on standard procedures.Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar based on recommendations of CLSI (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). RESULTS: From collected houseflies, 366 bacteria species were isolated. The most common isolated bacterium at hospitals was Klebsiella pneumoniae 43.3% (n= 90) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 37% (n= 77), while that of slaughterhouse was Proteus mirabilis. 29.1% (n= 46) followed by Citrobacter freundii 28.4% (n= 45). Among all the isolates from hospitals, cephalexin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and tetracycline, resistance rates were above 32.5% and gentamicin expressed the highest susceptibility among all the isolates from hospitals. It is worth to note that K. pneumoniae showed 61% and 44.5% resistance to cephalexin and chloramphenicol respectively. Similarly, all isolates from slaughterhouse were more than 28% and 30% resistant to cephalexin and chloramphenicol respectively. Surprisingly, among all the isolates, Citrobacter freundii were highly resistant to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: Houseflies collected from hospitals and slaughterhouse may be involved in the spread of drug resistant bacteria and may increase the potential of human exposure to drug resistant bacteria.
TI  - The influence of omentectomy on bacterial clearance: an experimental study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of an omentectomy on peritoneal defense mechanisms and  its clinical consequences have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of omentectomy on bacterial growth in blood and tissue specimen cultures in rats with experimental peritonitis. METHODS: Fifty Wistar-Albino rats were included in the present study. Animals were assigned into five groups as follow: Group 1 (n = 10), omentectomy alone; Group 2 (n = 10), omentectomy + bacterial peritonitis; Group 3 (n = 10), bacterial peritonitis alone; Group 4 (n = 10), laparotomy alone; and Group 5 (n = 10), sham group. Culture positivity rate and bacterial growth (colony forming units [CFU]/gram tissue) were assessed in mesenteric lymphoid tissue and venous blood of all animals. RESULTS: Bacterial growth in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3 than others (both, p < 0.05). CFU of Escherichia coli in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Groups 1 and 3 (both, p < 0.05/4). Blood culture positivity was significantly higher in Group 2 than the others (both, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The omentum has an important role in the host peritoneal defense system. Peritoneal infection may pursue a more severe course with increased bacterial entrance into the blood in the absence of the omentum.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates to fosfomycin.
AB  - The advancing antimicrobial drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae renders the  evaluation of potential novel therapeutic options necessary. We sought to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility to fosfomycin and 12 additional antibiotics of MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected between November 2007 and April 2009 at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, was examined using the Etest method. A total of 152 MDR Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.3%), Escherichia coli (17.1%), Proteus mirabilis (4.6%) and other species (2.0%). Antimicrobial susceptibility rates were highest for fosfomycin (92.8%), tigecycline (92.1%) and colistin (73.0%) followed by imipenem (35.5%), tetracycline (20.4%), gentamicin (19.7%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5%) and ciprofloxacin (10.5%). Of the 152 isolates, 85 (55.9%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR), of which 78 (91.8%) remained susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility to fosfomycin of the 79 carbapenemase-producing, 34 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and 24 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates was 94.9%, 94.1% and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, in this study fosfomycin exhibited good in vitro antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR Enterobacteriaceae. We suggest further evaluation of the potential clinical utility of fosfomycin against infections caused by these pathogens.
TI  - International spread and persistence of TEM-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an IncA/C2 plasmid containing Tn1696::Tn1 and IS5075-Tn21.
AB  - TEM-24 remains one of the most widespread TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative TEM-24 producers from Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain (13 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 Escherichia coli isolates, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 Proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). Clonal relatedness (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and E. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. Plasmid analysis included determination of the incompatibility group (by PCR, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (Tn3, Tn21, and Tn402). Similar PFGE patterns were identified among E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, while E. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups A, B2, and D). Highly related 180-kb IncA/C2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. Each plasmid contained defective In0-Tn402 (dfrA1-aadA1, aacA4, or aacA4-aacC1-orfE-aadA2-cmlA1) and In4-Tn402 (aacA4 or dfrA1-aadA1) variants. These integrons were located within Tn21, Tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with IS5075 interrupting their IRtnp and IRmer. In all cases, blaTEM-24 was part of an IS5075-DeltaTn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blaTEM-2 and blaTEM-3 variants. The international dissemination of TEM-24 is fuelled by an IncA/C2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. This work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of TEM-2 ESBL derivatives.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Clinical aspects and epidemiology of uncomplicated cystitis in women. German results of the ARESC Study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uncomplicated cystitis in women is among the most frequent infections  in the community setting. The German results of the international ARESC Study are reported concerning clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and investigated clinically including urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antimicrobials RESULTS: In Germany a total of 442 patients were enrolled and 412 were eligible. A positive urine culture (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) was found in 335 (81.3%); 325 (97.1%) of them had a monoinfection. A total of 317 uropathogens were further analyzed in a central laboratory (Genua). Escherichia coli was the most frequent (76.7%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (4.7%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.5%), enterococci (2.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (97.9%) followed by mecillinam (97.5%), nitrofurantoin (95.4%), and ciprofloxacin (95.4%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (59.2%) followed by cotrimoxazole (74.0%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.1%), mecillinam (97.5%), ciprofloxacin (92.3%), and nitrofurantoin (86.3%). The lowest rates were found again for ampicillin (56.6%) and cotrimoxazole (73.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin, mecillinam (not available in Germany), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Because of increasing resistance rates cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim) and fluoroquinolones are generally not recommended as first-choice drugs for empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - Comparison of 3 phenotypic-detection methods for identifying plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PABLs) have been detected in the strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. PABLs may be difficult to detect and might interfere in the therapeutic and infection-control processes. Although several PABL-detection methods based on phenotypes have been reported, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute currently does not recommend a routine detection method for PABLs. The aim of this study is to compare the performances of 3 phenotypic PABL detection methods. METHODS: Total 276 non-duplicated clinical isolates of E. coli (N=97), K. pneumoniae (N=136), and P. mirabilis (N=43) were collected from 14 hospitals in Korea between April and June 2007 in a non-consecutive and non-random manner. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect the PABL genes. Further, 3 phenotypic detection methods-cephamycin-Hodge test, Tris-EDTA (TE) disk test, and combination-disk test with 3-aminophenylboronic acid (BA)-were performed using cefoxitin and cefotetan disks. RESULTS: PABL genes were detected by multiplex PCR in 122/276 isolates, including 14/97 E. coli, 105/136 K. pneumoniae, and 3/43 P. mirabilis isolates. The combination-disk test with BA showed higher sensitivity (98.4%), specificity (92.2%), and efficiency (96.3%) than the cephamycin-Hodge (76.2%, 96.1%, and 88.6%, respectively) and the TE-disk (80.3%, 91.6%, and 87.9%, respectively) tests. CONCLUSIONS: The combination-disk test with BA is a simple, efficient, and interpretable test that can be applicable in clinical laboratories involved in the detection of PABLs in clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis (L), Quercus infectoria (Oliver) and Canthium parviflorum (Lam).
AB  - The present study aimed at evaluating the antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis, L., (Rutaceae), Quercus infectoria Oliver., (Fagaceae) and Canthium parviflorum Lam., (Rubiaceae) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytocoa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The experiment was carried out using disc diffusion method. The results revealed that the methanol extract of aerial parts of Ruta chalepensis (L) presented the highest zone of inhibition against tested pathogens. Other plants showed significant zone of inhibition.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  - The problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. These organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the pH of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. In this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary pH above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus aureus elevated the pH of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the pH of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. The most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. This strategy raises the nucleation pH (pH(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. Increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a pH(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. It is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity, phenol and flavonoid contents of Thespesia  populnea flower extracts.
AB  - Flavonoids which were reported as having many pharmacological activities, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, chemoprevention activities and they possess strong antiproliferative effects related to inhibition of cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction. On the basis of this Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. Ex Correa (Family-Malvaceae) was selected and it is having the major composition of flavonoids and the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers was investigated by agar well diffusion method. Furthermore our phytochemical studies indicated that methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers contains flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and anthroquinone glycosides. Moreover the individual components were identified by thin layer chromatography and Rf value was compared with standard flavonoid quercetin. The total phenolic and flavonoid content studies were also quantified. The bacteria used for antibacterial study were Shigella flexneri (NCIM 4924), Rhodococcus terrae (NCIM 5126), Escherichiae coli (ATCC 11775), Streptococcus faecalis (NCIB 2406), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883),Brevibacterium luteum (NCIM 2923), Micrococcus flavum (NCIM 2376), Proteus mirabilis (NCIB 8268), Bacillus licheniformis (NCIM 2468), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 2984), Flavobacterium devorans (NCIM 2581), Shigella sonei(ATCC 29930), Shigella boydii (ATCC 8700) and Shigella dysentriae (ATCC 13313).According to our results in the lowest tested concentration of 62.5 microg/ml and 125mug/ml 7.2% of the plant extract were active, 5% active in the concentration of 250 microg/ml, 75.7% active in the concentration of 500 microg/ml and 92.8% active at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml in a dose dependent manner.
TI  - High prevalence of bla(CTX-M-1)-group extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
AB  
TI  - The ARESC study: an international survey on the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens involved in uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The ARESC (Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiological Survey on Cystitis) study is  an international survey to investigate the prevalence and susceptibility of pathogens causing cystitis. Female patients (n=4264) aged 18-65 years with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled in nine European countries as well as Brazil during 2003-2006. Pathogens were identified and their susceptibility to nine antimicrobials was determined. Escherichia coli accounted for 76.7% of isolates. Among E. coli, 10.3% of the isolates were resistant to at last three different classes of antimicrobial agents. Resistance was most common to ampicillin (48.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29.4%) and nalidixic acid (18.6%). Fosfomycin, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin were the most active drugs (98.1%, 95.8% and 95.2% susceptible strains, respectively) followed by ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefuroxime (91.7%, 82.5% and 82.4%, respectively). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was >10% in Brazil, Spain, Italy and Russia. Overall, Proteus mirabilis were more susceptible to beta-lactams and less susceptible to non-beta-lactams than E. coli, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which are intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, were less susceptible to mecillinam (88.8%), fosfomycin (87.9%), cefuroxime (78.6%) and nitrofurantoin (17.7%). Resistance was rare in Staphylococcus saprophyticus, with the exception of ampicillin (36.4%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10.2%). In Italy, Spain, Brazil and Russia, the countries most affected by antimicrobial resistance, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes (mainly CTX-M type) were detected in 48 strains (39 E. coli, 6 K. pneumoniae and 3 P. mirabilis). Despite wide intercountry variability in bacterial susceptibility rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin and mecillinam have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated against the most common uropathogens.
TI  - Design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of Sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of Tucuman, Argentina. Non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. A hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing S. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. Microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature for 1 year were determined. Addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. The semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/mL. Its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. A pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. Our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing S. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. This topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - In vitro biological activity screening of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll.
AB  - This article reports the results of selected biological activities, including anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, of the petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts as well as the alkaloid fraction of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll (LCC, Lycopodiaceae) growing in Turkey. Anticholinesterase effect of the extracts was tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay based on Ellman method. Antioxidant activity of the LCC extracts was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging method at 0.2 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of LCC exracts using Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney and Vero cell lines. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were screened against the bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the fungi: Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis. Only the petroleum ether extract of LCC possessed remarkable activity against both AChE and BChE at 1 mg mL(-1) (76.5 and 69.6%, respectively), whereas LCC extracts showed low free radical-scavenging activity. All of the extracts were found to be more effective against the ATCC strains than isolated ones, particularly S. aureus, while the extracts had moderate antifungal activity. On the other hand, we found that only the petroleum ether extract was active against HSV. In addition, we also analysed the content of the alkaloid fraction of the plant by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identified lycopodine as the major alkaloid (60.8%).
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of crude extract of Aloe barbadensis to clinically isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Aloe barbadensis was tested on clinically isolated  bacterial pathogens i.e. Enterococcus bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing infection in human being. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts were used for the antibacterial effect, which was measured by the appearance of zone of inhibition. Relatively higher MIC concentrations were obtained for gram negative bacteria E. coli and K. pneumoniae, with ethanol extract; however, no inhibitory effect was noted for aqueous extract. Ethanolic extract possesses great inhibitory activity for gram positive bacteria, E. bovis followed by S. aureus. Among gram negative bacteria, highest inhibitory effect was observed with P. aeruginosa, followed by M. morganii, P. mirabilis, and P. vulgaris, which was significant (p < 0.01) than E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity tests of crude extract of A. barbadensis were carried out to validate the use of traditional medicinal herbal and results of this study tend to give credence to the common use of A. barbadensis gel and leaf.
TI  - [Evaluation of the MicroScan NegCombo panel Type 44 for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is important in guiding proper antimicrobial therapy for infected patients. We evaluated the performance of MicroScan NegCombo Type 44 panel (Dade Behring, USA), which was developed to confirm ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae using ceftazidime/clavulanate and cefotaxime/clavulanate. METHODS: From August 30 to September 20, 2007, 206 non-duplicate clinical isolates, including 106 Escherichia coli, 81 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 Klebsiella oxytoca, and 8 Proteus mirabilis were subcultured and tested with Type 32 and Type 44 panels. The results were compared with those of the CLSI phenotypic confirmatory test (CLSI-PCT) and disk approximation test (DAT). Isolates not susceptible to cefotetan or flagged as "Possible ESBL, unable to interpret confirm test (Possible ESBL)" on Type 44 panel were tested with boronic acid disks to confirm AmpC beta-lactamases (AmpC) production. RESULTS: Of the 206 isolates tested, 44 (21.4%) produced ESBL by CLSI-PCT or DAT, including 27 E. coli, 14 K. pneumoniae, 2 K. oxytoca, and 1 P. mirabilis. Thirty-eight isolates flagged as "Confirmed ESBL" on Type 44 panel were all confirmed as ESBL-producers. Of 14 K. pneumoniae flagged as "Possible ESBL", 6 were confirmed as ESBL and AmpC co-producers and 8 as AmpC-producers. CONCLUSIONS: Type 44 panel showed an excellent performance in detecting ESBL-producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. mirabilis. When flagged as "Confirmed ESBL", no other confirmatory test was necessary to report as ESBL; however, "Possible ESBL" required a differential test for AmpC production.
TI  - Doripenem activity tested against a global collection of Enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  - The emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates among Enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne AmpC producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. This scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. In this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL- and AmpC-producing strains, were evaluated. A total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria, except for doripenem (product package insert). Overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. ESBL rates were higher among Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by Escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and Proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). Derepressed AmpC production-mediated resistance rates were highest among Enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the ESBL phenotype and derepressed AmpC isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem MIC(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). The observed increase in AmpC- and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on carbapenem empiric therapy. Doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary Enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of fruit and leaf crude extracts of Momordica charantia: a Tanzania medicinal plant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Momordica charantia extracts on reference strains and microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. METHOD: Petroleum ether and methanolic crude extracts of fruits and leaves of the plant were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the disk diffusion method on four reference microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus; and four clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and Cryptococcus neoformans. RESULT: Antimicrobial activity was observed against all the tested microorganisms with exception to P. mirabilis and C. neoformans. Methanolic crude extracts exhibited relatively broader antimicrobial spectrum of activity than petroleum ether extracts with the as lower concentration as 0.075mg/microl. Methanolic fruit crude extract displayed the broadest antimicrobial spectrum by inhibiting majority (75%) of the tested microorganisms. Neither was there synergistic nor addition effect upon mixing leaf and fruit extracts of equal concentrations derived from the same solvent. CONCLUSION: Extracts of M.charantia demonstrated antimicrobial activity on tested microorganisms except on Proteus mirabilis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Fruit extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity than leaf extract. Further studies are recommended that will involve various parts of the plant, select different fractions of extracts and purify the active antimicrobial components.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection presenting as acute respiratory failure  and Gram-negative sepsis in a patient with astrocytoma.
AB  - In developing countries, Strongyloides stercoralis infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Death from strongyloidosis can result from hyperinfection or disseminated disease. Infections due to S. stercoralis are unusual in Saudi Arabia and are usually diagnosed in immigrants from endemic areas. We report a case in which S. stercoralis was isolated from the sputum of a patient with Gram-negative sepsis and respiratory failure, and review the salient features of this disease. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by clinicians treating patients in endemic areas presenting with new-onset wheezing, acute respiratory distress and/or Gram-negative sepsis to prevent the serious complications of Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens responsible for community-acquired urinary tract infections in an Italian community.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the pattern of the antimicrobial resistance among the leading uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs in an area of the region of Apulia, Southern Italy. Twenty-one thousand and two hundred outpatients, 6,893 males and 14,307 females, were enrolled. Urinary isolates were identified by conventional methods and the susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials determined. Recognized uropathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from 3175 positive samples, E. coli accounting for 68.04% of positive cultures. Most overall resistance was to ampicillin, while the resistance rate to cephalothin was higher than that of third generation cephalosporins. Although to a different degree, all the bacteria had an overall good susceptibility rate to quinolones as well as to fosfomycin but increased resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Our results confirm that E. coli is the leading uropathogen and provide information about the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the main pathogens causing community-acquired UTIs. These findings should be taken into account to help maintain the safety and efficacy of treatment for community-acquired UTIs.
TI  - Large scale multiplex PCR improves pathogen detection by DNA microarrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium density DNA microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. However, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen DNA. RESULTS: To increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex PCR (LSplex PCR) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. This protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. The LSplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. Application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen DNA by microarray hybridization by using LSplex PCR.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance in Taiwan of the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigecycline In-vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST), initiated in 2006, is a nationwide surveillance programme designed to monitor longitudinally the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered resistant bacteria. This study compared the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against clinical isolates of resistant Gram-negative bacteria determined by the broth microdilution and Etest methods. A total of 622 isolates were collected from patients treated at 20 teaching hospitals. Tigecycline had excellent in-vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (N = 275) with MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL and a 99.6% susceptibility rate, and also against ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 324) with MIC(90) 2 microg/mL and a 98.5% susceptibility rate. For ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis (N = 15) the MIC(90) was 4 microg/mL with a 73.3% susceptibility rate. For ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca (N = 8) the MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.5 and 1 microg/mL, respectively, with a 100% susceptibility rate. Limited agreement (<80%) was found between the broth microdilution and the Etest methods when determining the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against ESBL- producing K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca.
TI  - Changing trend in antimicrobial resistance of pediatric uropathogens in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance worldwide, particularly of Escherichia coli, and the first choice of an antimicrobial agent for empiric treatment of pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) is not well established. METHODS: The medical records from January 1991 to December 2005 for all children under 18 years of age admitted to Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei for their first UTI were reviewed. Two study periods, early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005), were chosen during the 15 year period for evaluating the trend of antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Of the 368 isolates, E. coli was the most common pathogen (81.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.0%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). Of the 368 isolates, 77.4% were resistant to ampicillin, 44.6% to co-trimoxazole, 27.2% to cephalothin, 15.0% to gentamicin, and 8.4% to nitrofurantoin. In the early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005) study periods, 199 isolates (54.1%) and 169 isolates (45.9%), respectively, were compared. The resistance to antimicrobial agents for overall pathogens in the early and late study periods, respectively, was as follows: 68.8% and 88.0% to ampicillin, 48.9% and 46.6% to co-trimoxazole, 26.8% and 28.9% to cephalothin, 16.2% and 19.8% to gentamicin, and 8.7% and 9.0% to nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSION: Among commonly used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of pediatric UTI, there is a trend towards increasing resistance to ampicillin and a persistently low resistance rate to gentamicin, cephalosporin, and nitrofurantoin. Parenteral first-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, and oral nitrofurantoin should be considered for first-line agents, given the resistance patterns of this study.
TI  - [Fluoroquinolones and Gram-negative bacteria: antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of resistance].
AB  - Fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and  topoisomerases IV). Related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (GyrA/GyrB for DNA gyrase and ParC/ParE for topoisomerase IV) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as AcrAB and MexAB. Along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (Qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas Proteus mirabilis and non fermenter Gram-negative, like Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. Qnr proteins determine a slight increase in MIC values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. More relevant is their impact on MPC values. Additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. AAC(6')-Ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to this enzyme action. Finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the QepA gene, which acts by a selective mechanism. Only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. In the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.
TI  - Hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by urinary tract infection with urinary retention.
AB  
TI  - Characterization and sequence analysis of extended-spectrum-{beta}-lactamase-encoding genes from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected during tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials.
AB  - In concert with the development of novel beta-lactams and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, bacterially encoded beta-lactamases have evolved to accommodate the new agents. This study was designed to identify, at the sequence level, the genes responsible for the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected during the global tigecycline phase 3 clinical trials. PCR assays were developed to identify and clone the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), and bla(CTX) genes from clinical strains. Isolates were also screened for AmpC genes of the bla(CMY), bla(ACT), bla(FOX), and bla(DHA) families as well as the bla(KPC) genes encoding class A carbapenemases. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates with ceftazidime MICs of > or =2 microg/ml were designated possible ESBL-producing pathogens and were then subjected to a confirmatory test for ESBLs by use of Etest. Of 272 unique patient isolates, 239 were confirmed by PCR and sequencing to carry the genes for at least one ESBL, with 44% of the positive isolates harboring the genes for multiple ESBLs. In agreement with current trends for ESBL distribution, bla(CTX-M)-type beta-lactamase genes were found in 83% and 71% of the ESBL-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, whereas bla(SHV) genes were found in 41% and 28% of the ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were tigecycline susceptible (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml), warranting further studies to define the therapeutic utility of tigecycline against strains producing ESBLs in a clinical setting.
TI  - Evaluation of screening methods to detect plasmid-mediated AmpC in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - There are currently no standardized phenotypic methods for the screening and detection of AmpC enzymes. This study aimed to evaluate different methods to detect AmpC enzymes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp., comparing the results from two disk-based methods and an agar dilution method. AmpC activity was determined for 255 clinical isolates by use of a three-dimensional enzyme assay combined with a multiplex PCR assay for plasmid-borne ampC genes. These results were compared against a disk-based inhibitor assay using various combinations of cefpodoxime and cefoxitin as antibiotic substrates and boronic acid or cloxacillin as an AmpC inhibitor. The presence of enzyme induction by disk approximation was evaluated using imipenem, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate as inducing agents against ceftazidime. Finally, an agar dilution assay was performed, using cefoxitin with and without added cloxacillin. AmpC activity was present in 49.8% of test isolates, 93.7% of which were positive for plasmid-borne ampC genes. CIT-like enzymes were predominant in E. coli, and DHA-like enzymes were predominant in Klebsiella spp. The disk-based inhibitor tests performed better than the agar dilution assay, while detection of AmpC by disk induction had a poor sensitivity. The cefoxitin-cloxacillin disk combination provided the best overall performance, with a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. This study confirmed the accuracy of disk-based inhibitor screening for AmpC enzymes, which proved reliable at detecting CIT- and DHA-like plasmid-borne ampC genes. The methods are simple enough for introduction into clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Detection of protozoan and bacterial pathogens of public health importance in faeces of Corvus spp. (large-billed crow).
AB  - Parasites and bacteria are reported in the faeces of birds in the current study.  Fresh faecal samples of the large-billed crow (Corvus spp.) were collected from the study site at Bangsar, an urban setting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. These samples were transported to laboratory and analysed for parasites and bacteria. Pre-prepared XLD agar plates were used for culturing the bacteria in the laboratory. Using the API 20ETM Test Strips, 9 different species of bacteria were identified belonging to the family Enterobacteriacea. They were Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera ascorbata, Salmonella arizonae, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei. The protozoan parasites detected include Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora spp., Blastocystis spp., and Capillaria hepatica and Ascaris lumbricoidus ova. Environmental air samples collected on agar plates using an air sampler in the area only produced fungal colonies. Some of these pathogens found in the crows are of zoonotic importance, especially Cryptosporidium, Blastocystis, Cyclopsora, Salmonella, Shigella and Kluyvera. The finding of Kluyvera spp. in crows in our current study highlights its zoonotic potential in an urban setting.
TI  - [Recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the CHU of Nice (2005-2007)].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: ESBL producing enterobacteria (E-ESBL+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of CTX-M beta-lactamase. So, 542 new strains were isolated in the CHU de Nice during the 2005-2007 period. The aim of this work was to characterize the ESBL and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. METHODS: Every first E-ESBL+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. Type of ESBL was determined by PCR, followed by sequencing for CTX-M and SHV enzymes. Typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. RESULTS: CTX-M type ESBL are predominant (45% of all E-ESBL+), mainly in Escherichia coli (34.5%). The TEM24 ESBL was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in Enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.4%). SHV5/12 ESBL was found mainly in Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). Several epidemic situations were identified, with CTX-M15 in Escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), SHV5/12 in Enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and TEM in Proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). Enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of TEM24 producing K. pneumoniae persists especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). CONCLUSION: Caracterization of E-ESBL+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against BMR cross transmission.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - A prospective study of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much controversy exists as to whether cephalosporin treatment is appropriate for infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms because no randomized controlled studies have been performed. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors performed a prospective study in female patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or P. mirabilis in four hospitals in Thailand from 2004 to 2006. The clinical and microbiological outcomes were evaluated at 72 hours after empirical ceftriaxone treatment. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients with the mean age of 65.29 years participated in this study. There were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory data between the ESBL-producing and ESBL-nonproducing groups except the higher rates of previous antibiotic use and urinary tract infection; and the lower frequency of costovertebral angle tenderness in the ESBL-producing group. Both clinical (65% and 93%) and microbiological (67.5% and 100%) responses at 72 hours after ceftriaxone treatment were poorer in the ESBL-producing group than in the ESBL-nonproducing group (p < 0.0002). CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate the outcomes of ceftriaxone treatment in acute pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The present study confirms that acute pyelonephritis in the female patients caused by ESBL-producing strains could not be treated with ceftriaxone.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - The crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust Foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. The catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. The effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the pH of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. The extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. In models inoculated with communities containing Proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary pH that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. The biocide had no effect on populations of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. In models inoculated with a mixed community containing Providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. Although K. pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of Providencia rettgeri. The results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units in Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwanese intensive care units (ICUs), a national surveillance of antibiotic resistance among important Enterobacteriaceae was conducted from September 2005 through November 2005 at the ICUs of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 574 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from various clinical samples of our ICU patients were submitted for in vitro test. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. The prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were 26% in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 16% in Serratia marcescens, 14% in Escherichia coli, and 13% in Proteus mirabilis, in which a significantly rising prevalence of ESBL production among K. pneumoniae was noted (p = 0.002) when compared with a previous Taiwanese survey in 2000. Heterogeneous resistance to various fluoroquinolones was found among our Enterobacteriaceae isolates, except for Enterobacter cloacae. Emergence of ertapenem-resistant isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and S. marcescens was noted. Gradually increasing rates of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were noted in Taiwanese ICUs. Periodic surveillance of the evolutionary trend of antimicrobial resistance among ICU isolates is crucial for starting appropriately empirical antimicrobial therapy in the future.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of fish mucus from Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala.
AB  - Extracts and preparations made from the animal origin were used extensively in folk and modern medicine for treating many human diseases. In the present study efforts have been made to find the antimicrobial effect of the mucus of two bottom dwelling fresh water fishes namely, Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala. Fish mucus were tested against ten pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholera. The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition in mm. The mucus collected from Cirrhinus mrigala shows a strong inhibiting activity than the mucus of Channa punctatus.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in the elderly: high prevalence and high turnover of strains.
AB  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) was followed in repeated prevalence surveys in a cohort of non-institutionalized residents (n=330), aged>or=80 y. Urine samples were collected at baseline, and at 6, and at 18 months. Phenotyping (PhenePlate) was performed on isolates of Escherichia coli to evaluate strain relatedness. ASB occurred in 19.0, 19.4, and 19.9% in women, and in 9.4, 9.6 and 7.9% in men, at baseline and at the 6- and 18-months follow-up, respectively, and ASB was found at least once in 37% of women and in 20% of men. Of those with ASB at baseline, 60% also had ASB in the 2 subsequent surveys. Among those with persisting E. coli bacteriuria, 76% and 40%, respectively, carried the same strain at the 6- and 18-months follow-ups. In women, we found that the risk of developing a symptomatic urinary tract infection within 24 months was higher among those with ASB at baseline than in those without bacteriuria (p=0.019). ASB is common and often persistent, but we found a high turnover of strains, indicating a high rate of recolonization.
TI  - [Evaluation of the Phoenix automated microbiology system for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the BD Phoenix (Beckton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, USA) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) test with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ESBL phenotypic confirmatory test by disk diffusion (CLSI ESBL test) in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: We tested 224 clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and P. mirabilis during May 2006 to March 2007. These isolates were examined by the Phoenix and the CLSI ESBL tests simultaneously. For the isolates showing discordant results between the two tests, boronic acid disk test was performed to differentiate AmpC beta-lactamase and ESBL. RESULTS: Among the 224 clinical isolates, 75 and 79 isolates were positive for ESBL by CLSI ESBL test and Phoenix test, respectively. Having detected 4 more isolates as ESBL-producers, Phoenix test showed a 98.2% agreement with a 100% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity compared with CLSI ESBL test. Among the four false positive isolates, three were AmpC-positive but ESBL-negative. CONCLUSIONS: The BD Phoenix ESBL test was sensitive and specific, and can be used as a rapid and reliable method to detect ESBL production in E. coli, Klebsiella species, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Urease-positive bacteria in the stomach induce a false-positive reaction in a urea breath test for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - This study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-Helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (UBT) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a UBT using film-coated [(13)C]urea tablets. The UBT was performed in 102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of H. pylori. Urease-producing bacteria other than H. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. In 4/102 patients, the UBT gave false-positive results. These false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. Five bacterial species with urease activity (Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. As there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-H. pylori bacteria and the UBT value, and all of the patients with a false-positive UBT result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the UBT were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. Thus, for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection using a UBT, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.
TI  - Optimal probe length and target location for electrochemical detection of selected uropathogens at ambient temperature.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated the clinical validity of the rapid detection of uropathogens by use of a DNA biosensor. This assay involves the hybridization of capture and detector probe pairs with bacterial 16S rRNA target molecules to form a DNA-RNA sandwich on the sensor surface. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody binds to the detector probe to enzymatically amplify the hybridization signal. These previous studies involved the hybridization of bacterial 16S rRNA target sequences with 35-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs at 65 degrees C. Achievement of point-of-care technology will be greatly facilitated by ambient-temperature detection. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of probe length and target location on signal intensity using hybridization temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees C. Signal intensity was found to vary dramatically with hybridization location in the species-specific bulge region of 16S rRNA helix 18. Probe pairs of as short as 10 nucleotides in length were able to produce a significant electrochemical signal, and signal intensity was correlated with probe length for probes of 10 to 20 nucleotides in length. The sensitivity of the Escherichia coli-specific 15-mer probe pairs was approximately 330 cells. These shorter probes allowed differentiation of Klebsiella pneumoniae from Proteus mirabilis 16S rRNA target sequences differing by a single nucleotide. A panel of oligonucleotide probe pairs ranging from 11 to 23 nucleotides in length was able to distinguish among seven groups of urinary tract pathogens. In conclusion, we have developed short oligonucleotide probe pairs for the species-specific identification of uropathogens at ambient temperature by use of an electrochemical sensor.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Surveillance study in Europe and Brazil on clinical aspects and Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology in Females with Cystitis (ARESC): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. INTERVENTION: Patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. MEASUREMENTS: This survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine European countries and in Brazil. Female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinical data of 4264 eligible patients were analysed. A positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. Within the 3018 pathogens, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (45.1%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). In all countries a susceptibility rate to E. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. The susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. They may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - Dissemination of the CTX-M-25 family beta-lactamases among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and identification of the novel enzyme CTX-M-41 in Proteus mirabilis in Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The CTX-M-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. We aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among Enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. METHODS: Fifty-four CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(CTX-M-25) genes by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was analysed by PFGE. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by VITEK-2. Plasmids encoding bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by Southern blot using a bla(CTX-M-25) probe. Chromosomal location of bla(CTX-M-25)-type was studied by I-CeuI restriction analysis. The bla(CTX-M-25) genetic environment was characterized by PCR mapping and partial sequencing. RESULTS: Ten out of 54 CTX-M-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(CTX-M-25) genes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Isolates were genetically unrelated. Four beta-lactamases were found: CTX-M-25, CTX-M-26, CTX-M-39 and CTX-M-41, a new member of the family (accession no. DQ023162) that differed from CTX-M-25 in three amino acids, Ala80Val, Val106Ile and Ile126Ser. bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but P. mirabilis, organized in a class I integron and located downstream of an ISEcp1 element. The genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. Several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. CONCLUSIONS: bla(CTX-M-25) exists in Israel in different enteric species. Spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. CTX-M-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of P. mirabilis.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - Effects of rifaximin on bacterial virulence mechanisms at supra- and sub-inhibitory concentrations.
AB  - Rifaximin, a poorly absorbed rifamycin derivative, exhibited time-dependent bactericidal activity and at concentrations as low as 1/32 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) caused morphological alterations in both susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. Spontaneous rifaximin-resistant clones appeared with an incidence of 2.6 x 10(-7). The percentage of Escherichia coli cells cured of various plasmids ranged from: 4.5-70% (Flac), 0-18% (pBP507), 7.7-43.8% (plasmid carrying ESBL genes) and 22.4-41.6% (plasmid encoding toxin from ETEC mex264). 8.4-18.2 and <0.1-18% of Staphylococcus aureus cells were cured (plasmid-mediated penicillinase), 9.5-58.6% of Morganella morganii (ESBL), 10.6-47.1% Citrobacter freundii (ESBL), 2.3-38.7% of Proteus mirabilis (ESBL) and 14.3-66.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL). Rifaximin reduced plasmid transfer from donor to recipient strains by >99%. The MIC of ceftazidime was reduced (2-4 dilutions) in the presence of rifaximin (0.5 x MIC) in ESBL producing strains. Rifaximin lowered the viability and virulence of the bacteria even though they developed resistance to the compound. In conclusion, the present findings add new features to the microbiological characteristics of rifaximin and suggest that if in vivo pathogens are exposed to sub-MICs of the drug, not only are their physiological functions compromised, but gene virulence and antibiotic resistance are not fully expressed.
TI  - Molecular survey of beta-lactamases conferring resistance to newer beta-lactams in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Polish hospitals.
AB  - The first national survey of resistance to newer beta-lactams in nosocomial populations of Enterobacteriaceae in Poland was performed. The study covered all nonrepetitive enterobacterial isolates cultured from specimens from inpatients in 13 regional secondary-care hospitals from November 2003 to January 2004. Among 2,388 isolates, the predominant species was Escherichia coli (59.6%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.5%) and Klebsiella spp. (8.5%). The frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was very high, with ESBLs present in 11.1% of all isolates and 40.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the latter value greatly exceeding that for E. coli (2.5%). The contribution of outbreak isolates was significant, resulting, for example, in a particularly high rate of ESBL producers among Serratia marcescens isolates (70.8%). The pool of ESBL types was overwhelmingly dominated (81.7%) by CTX-M-like beta-lactamases CTX-M-3 (80.6%) and CTX-M-15, with SHV types (17.5%; SHV-2, SHV-5, and SHV-12) and sporadic TEM-like enzymes (0.7%; TEM-19 and TEM-48) being the next most frequent. Acquired AmpC-type cephalosporinases were observed exclusively in P. mirabilis, in 20.5% of the isolates of this species (compared with the frequency of ESBL producers of 11.5% of P. mirabilis isolates). All these cephalosporinases (CMY-12, CMY-15, and a novel variant, CMY-38) originated from Citrobacter freundii. Four isolates of E. coli (two isolates), K. pneumoniae (one isolate), and P. mirabilis (one isolate) produced class A inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases (TEM-30, TEM-32, TEM-37, and SHV-49), being the first of such producers identified in Poland. The survey documented both specific and more global characteristics of the epidemiology of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in enterobacteria from Polish hospitals and demonstrated that the ESBL frequency has reached an alarming level.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria identified in urine].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to evaluate the frequency of isolation and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria responsible for urinary infections among in and out-patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Mohammed-V Military Instruction Hospital in Rabat, on bacteria isolated from 896 positive cytobacteriologic examinations of urine, from January 1 to December 31, 2005. RESULTS: Among the 7472 urinary samples, 896 answered the criteria of urinary infection (12%). Urinary infections were more frequent in in-patients (57.8%; sex-ratio F/M=1:16). Enterobacteria were the most frequent (85%) and especially Escherichia coli (44.7%). Gram positive bacteria (11.6%) were more frequently Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.1%). E. coli was highly resistant to amoxicillin, and sulfamethoxazole, whereas quinolones and aminosides maintained a good activity and third generation cephalosporines remain active (97% of susceptibility). Among the enterobacteria present, 3.2% were resistant to third generation cephalosporines with extended spectrum betalactamase.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in Taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  - A horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (RCWs) in Taiwan. Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem in US medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of MYSTIC program surveillance.
AB  - Since 1997, the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the United States, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 Enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, and 829 Gram-positive cocci. All isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. Meropenem (MIC(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/mL) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against Enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). KPC carbapenemases, usually found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. Meropenem remained active against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; MIC(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/mL). These US MYSTIC Program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against Enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.
TI  - Identification of an inhibitor of the MurC enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  - The pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the Mur enzymes. In the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the Escherichia coli MurC (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:L-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. Inhibition of ATP consumed during the MurC reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. After nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, C-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. The inhibition of MurC by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. C-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the E. coli MurC reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. Experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the MurC enzyme. Further work with MurC enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting MurC from genera (Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to E. coli, MurC enzymes from more distant Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
TI  - Surveillance for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae within the Calgary Health Region, Canada: the emergence of aac(6')-Ib-cr.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A study was designed to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated  quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Calgary Health Region (CHR). METHODS: During January and February 2004 and January and February 2007, 564 non-repeat isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or tobramycin were screened for PMQR determinants using a multiplex PCR for qnrA, qnrS and qnrB and aac(6')-Ib genes; aac(6')-Ib-cr was further identified by digestion with BstF5I. RESULTS: In 2004, 6/139 (4%) of the resistant E. coli were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr. In 2007, 53/398 (13%) were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr, 3/398 (0.8%) were positive for qnrS, and one isolate was positive for both. All the isolates were present in urines and the majority [40/63 (63%)] were submitted from community collection sites; 8 (13%) isolates co-produced AmpC beta-lactamases and 34 (54%) co-produced CTX-M-15. aac(6')-Ib-cr was present in one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one P. mirabilis, whereas one isolate of K. pneumoniae was positive for both aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that isolates with aac(6')-Ib-cr, often associated with CTX-M-15, are emerging among fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in the CHR. Our study suggests that surveillance for PMQR determinants should be undertaken on a regular basis.
TI  - Performance of chromID ESBL, a chromogenic medium for detection of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The chromogenic agar medium chromID ESBL (bioMerieux) was compared with BLSE agar medium (AES) for selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. A total of 765 samples (468 rectal swabs, 255 urine samples and 42 pulmonary aspirations) obtained from 547 patients was processed. All bacterial strains isolated on either medium were further characterized using biochemical tests, and ESBL producers were confirmed by synergy testing. Genetic characterization of ESBL genes was determined by PCR. A total of 33 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains [Escherichia coli (n=16), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=8), Enterobacter spp. (n=3), Citrobacter spp. (n=5) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1)] was recovered. The sensitivity after 24 h incubation was 88 % for chromID ESBL and 85 % for BLSE agar. At 48 h, the sensitivity of chromID ESBL increased to 94 % and was higher than that obtained with BLSE agar. The positive predictive value at 24 h for chromID ESBL was 38.7 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 28.3 -50.2 %)], which was significantly higher than that for BLSE agar [15.4 %, 95 % CI 10.1 -21.5 %]. On both media, false-positive results were mostly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to Enterobacteriaceae overproducing chromosomal cephalosporinase (Enterobacter spp.) or a chromosomal penicillinase (Klebsiella oxytoca). This study showed that chromID ESBL, a ready-to-use chromogenic selective medium, is sensitive and specific for rapid, presumptive identification of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Its chromogenic properties and its selectivity are particularly useful in specimens containing resident associated flora.
TI  - Efficacy of ertapenem for consolidation therapy of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative infections: a case series report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are becoming increasingly common and present significant challenges in terms of treatment. Carbapenems is the antibiotic class of choice for treatment of these types of infections. Ertapenem is the newest carbapenem, capable of being dosed once daily, and has some in vitro but little in vivo evidence supporting its use for the treatment of these resistant infections. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and microbiologic outcomes associated with ertapenem therapy of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series that examined the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of 22 patients who received ertapenem for treatment of an ESBL infection at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL, during 2003-2005. RESULTS: The majority (16/22) of patients received ertapenem for consolidation rather than initial therapy. Different antibiotics most commonly used were other carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. The most common infections treated were lower urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. Clinical efficacy was determined in all 22 patients, with 20 (91%) patients having a positive outcome, defined as either clinical improvement or clinical cure. The best clinical cure rate was seen with wound infections, where all 3 patients examined were found to be clinically cured. Microbiologic efficacy was determined in 7 patients, with 6 (85.7%) defined as microbiologic cure. One patient was found to be both a clinical and microbiologic failure and was also found to have developed an ertapenem-resistant strain of E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate potential microbiologic and clinical efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of ESBL-producing infections and the need for a prospective, randomized study examining its efficacy versus that of other carbapenems.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (91), Escherichia coli (49), Enterobacter spp. (27), Proteus mirabilis (17), Citrobacter freundii (2), Providencia stuartii (3) and Serratia spp. (5), with various MICs of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect MBLs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. METHODS: A total of 194 (95 MBL-positive and 99 MBL-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem MICs < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/L were examined. All isolates were evaluated by the double-disc synergy test (DDST), the combination disc test (CDT), the MBL Etest and the modified Hodge test. The presence of bla(VIM) and bla(IMP) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by PCR. RESULTS: In 30 bla(VIM)-positive isolates that exhibited MICs of imipenem < or = 4 mg/L, MBL Etest could not be evaluated. CDT with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of EDTA, and DDST after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of EDTA, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. CDT with imipenem and 1900 microg of EDTA exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). CONCLUSIONS: The CDT with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 M EDTA or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 M EDTA and the DDST with imipenem 10 mm apart from EDTA are the most effective methods for the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - [Prevalence and bacterial susceptibility of community acquired urinary tract infection in University Hospital of Brasilia, 2001 to 2005].
AB  - Urinary tract infection is among the most common infectious diseases in clinical  medicine, and knowledge of its epidemiology and the sensitivity profile of the etiological agents is mandatory. The aim of this study was to identify the most frequent etiological agents and the profile of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents of the bacteria isolated from urine cultures from outpatients at the University Hospital of Brasilia between 2001 and 2005. From analyses at the hospitals microbiology laboratory, there were 2,433 positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacteria (62.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%) and Proteus mirabilis (4.7%). Escherichia coli showed the highest sensitivity to amikacin (98.6%), gentamicin (96.2%), nitrofurantoin (96.3%) and the quinolones ciprofloxacin (90.9%) and norfloxacin (89.8%), with low sensitivity to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (50.6%). The others bacteria presented similar sensitivity profiles. In conclusion, Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacteria, and it was highly sensitive to aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin and quinolones.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Aegle marmelos against leaf, bark and fruit extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts from  the leaves, bark and fruit of A. marmelos was studied using disc diffusion method against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram Positive), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella paratyphi B (Gram Negative). Results suggest that the methanolic extract has significant antibacterial activity against tested bacteria. The present study justifies the claimed uses of A. marmelos in the traditional system of medicine to treat various infectious diseases.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - Occurrence of Proteus mirabilis associated with two species of venezuelan oysters.
AB  - The fecal contamination of raw seafood by indicators and opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms represents a public health concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of enteric bacteria colonizing oysters collected from a Venezuelan touristic area. Oyster samples were collected at the northwestern coast of Venezuela and local salinity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen of seawater were recorded. Total and fecal coliforms were measured for the assessment of the microbiological quality of water and oysters, using the Multiple Tube Fermentation technique. Analyses were made using cultures and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diverse enrichment and selective culture methods were used to isolate enteric bacteria. We obtained pure cultures of Gram-negative straight rods with fimbriae from Isognomon alatus and Crassostrea rhizophorae. Our results show that P. mirabilis was predominant under our culture conditions. We confirmed the identity of the cultures by biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and data analysis. Other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also isolated from seawater and oysters. The presence of pathogenic bacteria in oysters could have serious epidemiological implications and a potential human health risk associated with consumption of raw seafood.
TI  - Fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. The  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. In this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with Fournier's gangrene. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with Fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. The mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. Overall mortality was 22.7%. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. Liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). The etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. The most common isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and Proteus mirabilis. There were a total of 74 debridements. Other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). Major complications of Fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock, hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. Liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. Reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. Patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Activities of the frog skin peptide, ascaphin-8 and its lysine-substituted analogs against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and their antibiotic resistance necessitates novel therapeutic intervention. Ascaphin-8 is a cationic alpha-helical peptide that shows broad-spectrum antibacterial activity but is also toxic to human erythrocytes (LC(50)= 55 microM). This study assesses the activity of ascaphin-8, and a series of l-lysine-substituted analogs, against a range of clinical isolates of ESBL-producing bacteria. All ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (MIC=1.5-6 microM) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC=12.5-25 microM) strains tested were susceptible to ascaphin-8, as well as a group of miscellaneous ESBL-producing strains (Citrobacter, Salmonella, Serratia, Shigella spp.) (MIC< or = 25 microM). The Lys4- and Lys8-substituted analogs were generally the most potent against bacteria but showed the highest hemolytic activity. However, the Lys10, Lys14, and Lys18 analogs also displayed potent antibacterial activity while showing very low hemolytic activity (LC50> 500 microM). An unexpected finding was the susceptibility of ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis strains to ascaphin-8 (MIC=12.5-25 microM) and its Lys4-substituted analog (MIC= 6 microM), although non-ESBL isolates of this organism were resistant to these peptides (MIC> 100 microM).
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC production  in selected clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis, and compared the results of boronic acid disc screening with conventional susceptibility testing for the detection of AmpC-positive isolates. METHODS: E coli, Klebsiella species and P mirabilis with reduced susceptibility to amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and cephalexin, but without phenotypic evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were screened for AmpC activity using enzyme-extraction methods. The presence of plasmid-mediated ampC was determined by multiplex PCR. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using both disc and dilution-based methods. A disc-based screening method for detection of AmpC-producing strains was evaluated using boronic acid as an inhibitor of AmpC, and cefoxitin as the antibiotic substrate. RESULTS: Plasmid-mediated ampC was present in 26% of study isolates, with CMY-like enzymes detected predominantly in E coli and DHA-like enzymes predominantly in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Current susceptibility methods failed to detect a significant proportion of plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing isolates, with 33% of such strains interpreted as susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins using current Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. The boronic acid disc method showed sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98% respectively in detecting AmpC-positive isolates. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of plasmid-mediated ampC was high in the study population, and may be missed by conventional susceptibility testing methods. Inhibitor-based screening methods would improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype.
TI  - Drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic post-operative wounds in a regional referral hospital in Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound infections have been a problem in the field of surgery for a long time. Advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this problem because of development of drug resistance. Antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment. OBJECTIVE: A study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in Jinja hospital, Uganda. This study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. METHOD: Specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. Colony characteristics and Grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. Biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. Sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens. The isolates were: S.aureus (45.1%), Coliforms (16.9%), Proteus mirabilis (11.3%), P.aeruginosa (9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and Enterobacter spp (2.82%). Most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. There was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). Most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (Coliforms, P.aeruginosa, E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Ceftazidime but resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxycillin and Chloramphenicol. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains formed 25% of this species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (57.2%). Some organisms e.g. S.aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: Since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. It is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. There is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  - The aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (CBM) and nosocomial meningitis (NM) within 17 years nationwide survey. All cases of gram-negative bacillary CBM within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were CBM. Those 24 cases were compared with all CBM (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. Among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, A. baumannii in 23 cases, Ps. aeruginosa in 15 cases and Enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. Among CBM, in 13 cases Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli 6, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3, Proteus mirabilis 2, Enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases Ps. aeruginosa and in 6 cases Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The only significant risk factor for CBM due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. However, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.
TI  - [Epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (PB)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. This study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after PB in a series of 1,216 biopsies. Bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. RESULTS: All patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before PB. Bacterial identification was possible in fourteen cases: E. coli (nine cases), Proteus mirabilis (one case), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), Enterococcus faecalis (one case), Staphylococcus Spp (one case), Clostridium perfringens (one case). Only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). A high rate of resistance of E. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. However, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2GC and 3GC) and amikacin in 100% of cases. Prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. Empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2GC or 3GC, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.
TI  - Species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  - Previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of Proteus mirabilis. In the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, P. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. Little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which P. mirabilis encrusts catheters. In the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with P. mirabilis, when Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii or Enterobacter cloacae were present, P. mirabilis was rarely or never found. The hypothesis that the absence of P. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. Experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of P. mirabilis with M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli had no effect on the ability of P. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. Co-infection with Ent. cloacae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly increased the time that catheters took to block (P <0.05). The growth of Ent. cloacae, M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with P. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. In the case of Ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (P < or =0.01). In all cases, however, P. mirabilis was able to generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. The results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between P. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with P. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.
TI  - First report of the emergence of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) as the predominant ESBL isolated in a U.S. health care system.
AB  - CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have become increasingly common worldwide, with the notable exception of the United States, where TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs have appeared to predominate. We have noted the emergence of ESBLs in our health care system (the University Health System in San Antonio, TX), especially in Escherichia coli isolates, that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime rather than ceftazidime, suggesting the possibility of CTX-M-type enzymes. Microbiology laboratory records were reviewed to identify ESBL-producing isolates and to compare the diameters of ceftazidime disk diffusion zones of inhibition to cefotaxime zone diameters. All isolates had been initially detected and confirmed using the procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. A total of 94 stored ESBL-producing isolates recovered between January 2000 and June 2006 (predominately from blood and normally sterile fluids) were retrieved for further study and screened using PCR primers specific for the presence of CTX-M, TEM, and SHV ESBLs. Only small numbers of retained ESBL-producing isolates were available for study in 2000 and 2002. The percentages of available ESBL-producing organisms in the following years were found to produce CTX-M enzymes: 2000, 25%; 2001, 10%; 2002, 0%; 2003, 60%; 2004, 69%; 2005, 89%; and 2006, 70%. The most common CTX-M-type ESBL was CTX-M-15, followed by CTX-M-16, CTX-M-8, and CTX-M-14. Comparing the disk diffusion zone diameters of cefotaxime and ceftazidime was helpful with the initial recognition of CTX-M-producing E. coli, which had an average cefotaxime zone diameter 7 mm smaller than the ceftazidime zone. However, comparing ceftazidime and cefotaxime zones for CTX-M-producing Klebsiella spp. was not helpful with initial recognition. CTX-M enzymes were also identified in Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of the E. coli isolates, the CTX-M-producing isolates did not represent the spread of a single clone in the institution or in the community. In conclusion, CTX-M-type ESBLs are now the most common ESBL type isolated from patients in our health care system and may also be present but unrecognized in other U.S. locales.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. METHODS: Fifty-six SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. All the animals were incurred with 30% III degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20 mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. The animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. At the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. The number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: Antibiotics significantly increased the number of cocci (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. In selective culture of gut bacilli, E.Coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis appeared. After the rats received antibiotics treatment, E. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus and other bacilli. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. Then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from April 1997 to March 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. The various isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial UTI exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. Culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.
TI  - Convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - Although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the CLSI currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of MBLs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (DDTs) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and Tris-EDTA (TE) to detect MBLs. Sixteen isolates (4 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens isolate, 1 Aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 Aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing IMP-1, IMP-1-like, IMP-18, GIM-1, SPM-1, VIM-2, VIM-2-like, and chromosomal MBLs and 20 isolates (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 S. marcescens isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 A. baumannii isolates) producing non-MBL carbapenemases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 microl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1:320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1:320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. DDT with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 MPA appears to be convenient for the detection of MBLs in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of community-acquired urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents in Spain: a comparative multicenter study (2002-2004).
AB  - The susceptibility patterns of 2724 uropathogens isolated in 9 Spanish regions during 2002, and 3013 obtained in 2004 were determined. The antibiotics tested were fosfomycin trometamol, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefixime, cefuroxime-axetil, pipemidic, ceprofloxacin, trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen in both studies (73% vs. 68.3%) followed by Proteus mirabilis 7.2% vs. 6.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4% vs. 5.2%). Enteroccocus spp. (4.7% vs. 6.8%), Streptoccocus agalactiae (1.7% vs. 3.1%) and Staphyloccocus saprophyticus (0.7% vs. 1.3%)were the most frequent Gram-positive pathogens. 31.3% of E. coli in 2002 and 32% in 2004 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Around 40% of E. coli were resistant to a single agent. 21.6-24.1% were resistant to two antibiotics. 35.4% of first period isolates, and 37.6% of second period ones were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics. Fosfomycin (2.1- 2.8%) and nitrofurantoin (3.5-5.7%) had the lowest resistance rates for E. coli. Amoxicillin (58.2-58.7%), co-trimoxazole (30.8-33.8%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6-22.7%) showed the highest resistance rates, and their suitability as empiric treatments for UTI should probably be re-evaluated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - Nosocomial meningitis caused by Enterobacteriaceae: risk factors and outcome in 18 cases in 1992-2007.
AB  - Nosocomial neuroinfections due to Enterobacteriaceae represented 9.5% in our cohort of 171 cases of paediatric meningitis within last 15 years. Commonest etiologic agents was E. coli - 9 (50%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae - 3 (16,7%) and Enterobacter cloacae. Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella enteritidis (1 each). Commonest risk factors were neonatal age 13 - (72.2%), very low birth weight 5 (27.8%), craniocerebral trauma - 4 (22.2%) and neurosurgery - 5 (27.8%). All but 1 case were treated with antibiotics: 8 with III-rd and 3 with IV-th generation cephalosporins (ceftazidim, cefotaxim and cefepim) 2 with meropenem and 4 with ciprofloxacin: Nosocomial meningitis due to enterobacteriaceae was associated with significantly high mortality (29.9% vs. 15.1% in all cohort of pediatric meningitis - p<0.02).
TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms. However, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in VAP. Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of ertapenem in the treatment of VAP caused by susceptible ESBL strains. METHODS: Ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of VAP beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: From June 2005 to June 2006, we enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an ICU and diagnosed with VAP due to Gram-negative ESBL strains. Causative organisms identified as ESBL producers susceptible to ertapenem were Klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Citrobacter freundii (2). Clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. The drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem appears to be suitable for ESBL VAP therapy. This pilot study suggests subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.
TI  - [Biological hazards in air at municipal waste landfills].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the microbiological air quality at the selected municipal waste landfills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted during the summer at two municipal landfills. Air samples were collected on agar plates. The evaluation was based on the concentration levels of airborne bacteria and fungi and the identification of isolated strains. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the level of 10(3) cfu/m3. The highest concentrations of bacteria in air were observed during unloading, disposing and compacting of municipal wastes (landfill 1 - 6,1 x 10(3) cfu/ml, landfill 2 - 5,4 x 10(2) cfu/m3). The highest concentrations of fungi in air were observed at filled up parts of the landfills (landfill 1 - 4,8 x 10(2) cfu/m3, landfill 2 - 1,2 x 10(3) cfu/m3). The qualitative analysis of the air samples indicated the presence of 21 bacterial and fungi. Among of them bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans are classified as harmful biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of bacteria and fungi in air samples collected at the selected municipal waste landfills did not exceed the reference values. The concentration levels of bioaerosols are diversified according to the size of the landfill, the total number of accumulated wastes and the level of area usage. It is suggested using by municipal waste workers personal protective equipment, especially for respiratory airways and skin and also keeping the rules of individual hygiene.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial profiles of selected isoquinoline alkaloids from Fumaria and Corydalis species.
AB  - In the current study, 33 isoquinoline alkaloids belonging to protopine-, benzylisoquinoline-, benzophenanthridine-, spirobenzylisoquinoline-, phthalideisoquinoline-, aporphine-, protoberberine-, cularine-, and isoquinolone-types as well as 7 derivatives of them obtained from some Fumaria and Corydalis species growing in Turkey have been evaluated for their in vitro antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madine-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines and their maximum non-toxic concentrations (MNTC) and cytopathogenic effects (CPE) were determined using acyclovir and oseltamivir as the references. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the alkaloids were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans by the microdilution method and compared to ampicilline, ofloxacine, and ketocanazole as the references. The alkaloids did not present any notable antibacterial effect, while they had significant antifungal activity at 8 microg/ml concentration. On the other hand, the alkaloids were found to have selective inhibition against the PI-3 virus ranging between 0.5 and 64 microg/ml as minimum and maximum CPE inhibitory concentrations, whereas they were completely inactive towards HSV.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - Predictors of mortality in patients with bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: importance of inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms markedly increase the rates of treatment failure and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify risk factors for mortality in adult in-patients with BSI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-BSI). Particular attention was focused on defining the impact on the mortality of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (defined as the initiation of treatment with active antimicrobial agents >72 h after collection of the first positive blood culture). A total of 186 patients with ESBL-BSI caused by Escherichia coli (n = 104), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 58), or Proteus mirabilis (n = 24) were identified by our microbiology laboratory from 1 January 1999 through 31 December 2004. The overall 21-day mortality rate was 38.2% (71 of 186). In multivariate analysis, significant predictors of mortality were inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 6.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18 to 12.42; P < 0.001) and unidentified primary infection site (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.38 to 5.27; P = 0.004). The inadequately treated patients (89 of 186 [47.8%]) had a threefold increase in mortality compared to the adequately treated group (59.5% versus 18.5%; OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.76 to 3.22; P < 0.001). The regimens most commonly classified as inadequate were based on oxyimino cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone therapy. Prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment is essential in patients with ESBL-BSI, and empirical decisions must be based on a sound knowledge of the local distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns.
TI  - An in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (Allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Garlic (Allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted in Gondar University Teaching Hospital School of Medical Laboratory Technology, Microbiology Laboratory from June 2004 to April 2005 by agar dilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of garlic to control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATTCC 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method The data was collected in triplicate. RESULTS: All the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of S. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. Garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. CONCLUSION: Crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. Nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
TI  - Surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and routine use of contact isolation: experience from a three-year period.
AB  - The usefulness and applicability of isolation precautions were questioned for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae in the endemic setting. We performed a surveillance programme for ESBL-positive organisms and the infection control management of patients colonized or infected with these organisms. Between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004, a total of 147 cases of ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis from 123 patients were noted. The overall incidence of ESBL-producing-strain-positive cases was 0.12/1000 patient-days. The proportion of referred cases was 35% (N=51); 65% of cases (N=96) were acquired in our institution. Infections developed in 57 cases (38.8%), of which 36 (63.3%) were nosocomial. Contact isolation precautions were carried out for 79.6% of the cases, with a median duration of contact isolation precautions for 14 days (range: 0-144). The contact isolation precautions resulted in 2985 isolation days in total, i.e. 995 isolation days per year. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed clonal diversity in 94.2% of the isolates from patients. Seven patient-to-patient transmissions were noted. Only in 10 cases (6.8%) was colonization with ESBL-producing strains cleared. Considering the large number of immunocompromised patients treated in our institution (>1500 bone marrow or solid organ transplantations performed during 2002-2004), we will continue to isolate patients who are colonized or infected with ESBL-producing organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - [Antagonistic effect of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus acidophilus on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus mirabilis cells].
AB  - Data of the ultrastructural cellular changes of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, including K. pneumoniae, C. freundii and P. mirabilis cells impacts to bacteriocin-producing L. acidophilus are presented. Enterobacteria in response to the bacteriocinogenic effect of lactobacilli are manifestated by expressive destructions of sensitive to pore formation bacteriocin cells. Various morphological types of enterobacteria cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms are revealed. The specific ultrastructural changes of enterobacteria cells which evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells membranes are detected. The destabilization of cellular wall in expansion periplasmic spaces and appearance of the ultrastructural reorganization of bacterial cells nucleoid also are registrated. Revealing the mechanism of lactobacilli secreted bacteriocin action to conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria might provide new ways to select the effective highly antagonistic probiotic strains.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - Comparison of three techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. METHODS: Twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. Three types of samples were taken from each dog. Urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. The samples were then cultured on blood agar and MacConkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). The most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were Escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). In the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. However, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. The uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. All the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.
TI  - Accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria. A modified double-disc test (MDDT) is incorporated in a Gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. The MDDT identified accurately ESBLs in all isolates subsequently confirmed as ESBL-producers by the standard Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) combined disc method. Of 1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for ESBLs by MDDT and 95 (7.8%) were positive by the CLSI method. ESBLs were detected in 48 (7.8%) E. coli, 21 (8%) K. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) Proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) Providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Time required for ESBL detection by the MDDT method was one day. The protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of ESBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens that cause community-acquired urinary tract infections in Antananarivo, Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract pathogens obtained from patients in Madagascar are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics that are readily available at a low price. This poses a real problem for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: To obtain data on the pathogens responsible for community-acquired UTIs in Antananarivo and on their susceptibility patterns to the antimicrobial agents that are currently used to treat UTIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine of patients at the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar between January 2004 and April 2006. RESULTS: We isolated 903 pathogens from 673 women and 213 men. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (607 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (87 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (35 strains) and Proteus mirabilis (32 strains). Seventy-seven per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 65.7% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and more than 15% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Strains were rarely resistant to more expensive antibiotics (ceftriaxone 5.9%, fosfomycin 4.6%). Most bacteria showed intermediate susceptibility to nitroxolin. Resistance rates of E. coli to ceftriaxone and gentamicin increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, due to the increase in strains harbouring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcaceae and Staphylococcus spp. were rarely resistant, but 9.5% of streptococci were resistant to penicillin A and 8% of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of amoxicillin- and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant Enterobacteriaceae implies that another antibiotic should be used for empirical treatment and that there is a need for new generic drugs in developing countries, especially in Madagascar.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Increased serum IgA and IgM against LPS of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of CFS and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  - There is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. The present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of IgA and IgM to LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in CFS patients, patients with partial CFS and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgA against the LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with CFS than in normal volunteers and patients with partial CFS. Serum IgA levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the FibroFatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. The results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of CFS and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria. It is suggested that all patients with CFS should be checked by means of the IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.
TI  - Occurrence of qnrA-positive clinical isolates in French teaching hospitals during 2002-2005.
AB  - Bacteria harbouring the novel qnrA plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. In total, 1,468 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in France during 2002-2005 and screened for qnrA. Overall, 28 isolates (22 Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Citrobacter freundii, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnrA, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of ESBL-producing isolates (22% of the E. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-ESBL-producing isolates. The prevalence of qnrA among consecutive ESBL-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). Of the qnrA-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. Twenty-one of the 22 qnrA-positive E. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the Paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. The qnrA genetic environment was similar to that of the In36 integron. The remaining two isolates had qnrA variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. The ESBL gene associated with qnrA was bla(SHV-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(PER-1) and bla(SHV-2a) were found in two isolates. In France, it appears that qnrA-positive isolates are predominantly E. cloacae isolates producing SHV-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an In36-like integron.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. ESBLs are most often plasmid-mediated. In Taiwan, the prevalence of ESBLs in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in Escherichia coli isolates. The most prevalent types of ESBLs are SHV-5, SHV-12, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-14 in isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli, with differences between institutions. SHV-12 and CTX-M-3 have been reported as the most common ESBLs in isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. Molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the ESBL-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. The current ESBL screen guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) are issued for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of ESBL in an isolate co-harboring an AmpC beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. Empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of ESBLs in an institution with a high prevalence of ESBL producers. Carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. To retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.
TI  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (FEBLA), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (LF) from non-lactose fermenters (NLF) in comparison with MacConkeys agar. Performance of FEBLA was at par with the latter. On FEBLA medium, the contrast between LF and NLF colonies was pronounced and Klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on MacConkeys agar (Hi Media). Unlike MacConkeys agar, a 24 h culture of K. pneumoniae cells on FEBLA were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. Escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. No change in cell morphology was evident with regard to Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter koseri and Acinetobacter baumannii. Performance of the medium was controlled using E. coli and S. flexneri. FEBLA is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - Urinary tract infection caused by fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - In 2001, fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli isolates emerged in Japan in  patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), and accounted for ca. 8% of isolates. This is a worldwide occurrence as reported by the ECO.SENS study. The number of fluoroquinolone- and cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with complicated UTI is increasing. Most cephem-resistant isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The rates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae differ between countries but there are ESBL producers in urinary Enterobacteriaceae isolates in most countries. More seriously, most nosocomial ESBL producers are also resistant to non-beta-lactams, such as the fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin and co-trimoxazole. This causes serious problems in the chemotherapy of cystitis.
TI  - In vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from Intensive Care Units in Taiwan: SMART 2004 programme data.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against Gram-negative bacterial isolates from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from ICUs of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. Sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam concentration of 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. Piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam had better activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/L (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/L for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). For Acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. Adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and A. baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam) isolates. Results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam are dependent on the method used. Piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteria from patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe.
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe of December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. More rare species of Gram-negative bacilli, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum were also isolated. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was more extensive compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp., but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, probably reflecting that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - A simple phenotypic method for differentiation between acquired and chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening methods for the detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are technically demanding. The purpose of this study was to assess screening methods for the detection of these enzymes in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: Isolates were selected according to a resistance phenotype consistent with production of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Detection of acquired ampC genes was done with a multiplex ampC-PCR and sequencing. The phenotypic detection methods evaluated included visual examination of antibiogram plates to identify the presence of scattered colonies located near the edge of the inhibition halo of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and a double-disc synergy test using cloxacillin (500 mg) to inhibit AmpC enzymes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven isolates were selected from among 6,209 isolates recovered. Acquired ampC genes (blaCMY-2, blaDHA-1, blaCMY-4 and blaACC-1) were found in 19 (24.7%) of these isolates, including 14 E. coli, two K. pneumoniae and three P. mirabilis isolates. The differential trait for the presence of colonies in the inhibition halo was 100% sensitive and specific. Similar results were obtained for the cloxacillin test, except for the E. coli isolates in which specificity was 10.3%. CONCLUSION: The phenotypic trait described here can be considered useful for suspecting the presence of these enzymes. The cloxacillin test was only useful in isolates lacking a natural AmpC beta-lactamase.
TI  - Using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. Changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. Interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation rate. Susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the MRSA isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. Levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. Statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P, 0.042) and Escherichia coli (P, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising MRSA isolation rate (P, 0.001) were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. Substitution of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in E. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in MRSA isolation rate. No associations were detected on susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. These findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of MRSA may vary by both drug and organism.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - Trends in production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteria of medical interest: report of the second Italian nationwide survey.
AB  - Results of a 2003 survey carried out in Italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteria are presented. Eleven Italian Microbiology Laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). ESBL screening was performed by MIC data analysis. Confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on CLSI methodology. ESBL determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. Results were compared to those of the 1999 Italian survey (8,015 isolates). The prevalence of ESBL producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). Among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent ESBL-positive species was Escherichia coli (Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). Proteus mirabilis was the most prevalent ESBL-positive species among outpatients. In both groups, most ESBL-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. TEM-type ESBLs were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). Non-TEM, non-SHV determinants emerged: CTX-M-type in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and PER-type in P. mirabilis, Providencia spp., and E. coli. With the exception of 3/163 P. mirabilis isolates and 1/44 Providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all ESBL-positive enterobacteria. Susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. Carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. Amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. The appearance of ESBL-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Increasing trend in the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae lacking chromosomal ampC gene at a Korean university hospital from 2002 to 2004.
AB  - The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae naturally lacking chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases. A total of 1860 clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., and Proteus mirabilis were collected from a Korean hospital between January 2002 and December 2004. For the isolates that are nonsusceptible to cefoxitin, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the bla(SHV), bla(TEM), and bla(AmpC) genes and sequencing were performed. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were found in 2.9% (37 isolates of DHA-1, 1 isolate of CMY-1, 1 isolate of CMY-2, and 1 isolate of ACT-1) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (5 isolates of DHA-1) of Klebsiella oxytoca, 0.8% (1 isolate of DHA-1) of Salmonella spp., and none of P. mirabilis isolates. The DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae was only 2 isolates (0.6%) in 2002, but the rate and the number significantly increased to 2.4% (13 of 538 isolates) in 2003 and to 4.3% (22 of 512) in 2004. In conclusion, DHA-1 is the most prevalent plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae lacking chromosomal ampC gene, and the DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae isolates have rapidly increased since 2003 in a Korean hospital. In addition, this is the first report of the appearance of a K. pneumoniae isolate producing ACT-1 beta-lactamase in Korea.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Antibiotic treatment and resistance of unselected uropathogens in the elderly.
AB  - A population-based study was conducted among women over the age of 70 years with  complaints of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). The positive predictive value of the nitrite test alone or in combination with the leukocyte esterase test ranged between 83% and 99%. The nitrofurantoin prescription rate decreased whereas fluoroquinolone and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid prescriptions increased with increasing age. The aetiology of infection was age-dependent. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated uropathogen, followed by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. For these uropathogens, the lowest susceptibility percentages were found for amoxicillin, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. As trimethoprim susceptibility reached approximately 75%, it may be advisable not to use this as a first-choice agent in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in the elderly.
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - [Rare bacteria species found in wounds of tsunami patients. Predominance of gram-negative rods, increased antibiotic resistance].
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advise in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical microbiology laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative rods were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. However, more rare species of gram-negative rods were also isolated, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was higher compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp, but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Possibly, this reflects that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Case analysis of purple urine-bag syndrome at a long-term care service in a community hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Purple urine-bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare phenomenon in which the contents of urine bags turn purple or blue following patient catheterization. The condition often causes care givers tremendous distress. We investigated the prevalence and possible causes of PUBS for a group of elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 157 patients featuring urine catheterization, 13 of whom exhibiting PUBS were analyzed with regards to age, functional status, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications, living location, feeding route, bowel habits, and the pattern of use of a urinary catheter. Urine samples were cultured from all the PUBS patients participating. RESULTS: Two men who underwent cystostomy and 11 women who underwent urethral catheterization who exhibited PUBS were observed for this study. The age, duration of catheterization, number of daily medications feeding pattern and functional status between the group exhibiting PUBS and the group of patients without PUBS demonstrated no significant differences. A total of 69.2% of the PUBS-affected patients, as compared to 43.1% of the non-PUBS patients, lived in nursing homes, and 84.6% of the PUBS-affected patients were constipated, as were 66% of the non-PUBD subjects. In total, 72.7% of PUBS patients were reported to be using a laxative suppository, compared with 41% of the non-PUBS group, whereas 92.3% of PUBS patients were catheterized using a plastic (PVC) foley, as compared to 70.8% of the non-PUBS patients. The pH for 12 out of 13 PUBS patients' urine was > or = 7. Escherichia coli, Provendicia var. spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae were the common pathogens isolated from the urine samples provided by our PUBS patients. CONCLUSION: We found that PUBS was more likely associated with the female gender, alkaline urine, constipation, institutionalization, the use of a plastic (PVC) urinary catheter, and certain bacteria such as Provendicia var. spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - DNA sequence analysis of the genetic environment of various blaCTX-M genes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Over a 3 year period (2000-2003) 21 Escherichia coli, 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Serratia marcescens and 1 Proteus mirabilis producing CTX-M-type beta-lactamase were collected from five different hospitals in Paris, France. This study was conducted to analyse the genetic environment of these 28 bla(CTX-M) genes. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion method and MICs of various beta-lactams were determined by an agar dilution method. PCR was used to detect and sequence alleles encoding CTX-M, TEM, SHV and CMY enzymes. The genetic environment was analysed by amplification and direct sequencing using various set of PCR primers or cloning in pBK-CMV. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates contained seven different bla(CTX-M) genes: bla(CTX-M-1) (4 strains), bla(CTX-M-2) (2 strains), bla(CTX-M-3) (4 strains), bla(CTX-M-9) (1 strain), bla(CTX-M-14) (5 strains), bla(CTX-M-15) (11 strains), bla(CTX-M-24) (1 strain). TEM-1 was associated with CTX-M-type enzymes in 15 isolates. Two strains produced both CTX-M-15 and SHV-2 or CTX-M-14 and CMY-2. In 25 strains the insertion sequence ISEcp1 was located upstream of the 5' end of the bla(CTX-M) gene. Among these strains, in five isolates, ISEcp1 was disrupted by insertion sequences such as IS26 (in three of them) or IS1 or IS10. Insertion sequence IS903 was found downstream of bla(CTX-M-14) or bla(CTX-M-24). Examination of the other three bla(CTX-M) genes (two bla(CTX-M-2) and one bla(CTX-M-9)) by cloning, sequencing and PCR analysis revealed the presence of complex Class 1 integrons, In35, an integron similar to In60 and a novel integron. CONCLUSIONS: This work further confirmed the predominant role of ISEcp1 in the mobilization of bla(CTX-M) genes of the CTX-M-1 cluster and the presence of In35, of an integron similar to In60 and a novel complex Class 1 integron.
TI  - Surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples and faecal carriers in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms isolated from clinical samples and faecal carriers in 2001 and 2002. METHODS: A total of 5251 Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples and 1321 stool samples were evaluated for the presence of ESBLs. The stool samples were spread onto plates of MacConkey agar containing 2 mg/L cefotaxime for selection of ESBL-producing strains. These strains were defined as those showing synergism between amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamases involved were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR assays and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains among clinical Enterobacteriaceae was 1.7%. Of these, 87.6% produced CTX-M, 25.8% produced SHV and 2.2% were TEM-type-producing strains. All clinical ESBL-producing strains were Escherichia coli, with the exception of four Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Citrobacter freundii. The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing organisms was 3.3%. Of these, 75% produced CTX-M-type enzymes followed by 22.7% SHV-producing strains. All faecal ESBL-producing strains were E. coli except for one Enterobacter cloacae and one Proteus mirabilis. This latter strain produced the PER-1 enzyme reported for the first time in Spain. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains in stool samples was higher than that observed in clinical samples from the same period. The different types of ESBLs found were similar in both contexts. The most prevalent ESBLs were the CTX-M-related enzymes, with nine different types, followed by SHV-12.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the Asia-Pacific region (SENTRY 1998-2002).
AB  - We examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter koseri, and Salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of the SENTRY Asia-Pacific Surveillance Program between 1998 and 2002. During the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for ESBL production and hyperproduction of K. oxytoca chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase enzyme. High rates of confirmed ESBL-producing isolates were found in K. pneumoniae strains from Singapore (35.6%), followed by those from mainland China (30.7%), South Africa (28.1%), and the Philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in Japan and Australia. ESBL-producing E. coli strains were also prominent in mainland China (24.5%), Hong Kong (14.3%), and Singapore (11.3%). ESBL-producing K. oxytoca were common in the Philippines (38.5%), Singapore (33.3%), and China (30.0%). Hyperproduction of K. oxytoca chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in Australia and Japan. P. mirabilis strains from Singapore produced ESBL (17.9%) despite the low prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. Few ESBL-producing C. koseri and Salmonella spp. strains were found in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Africa. Although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive ESBL phenotype in K. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in E. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for the confirmation of ESBL production. ESBL-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem retained activity against all ESBL-producing strains. Organisms expressing ESBLs are widely distributed in the Asia-Pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata Cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. Inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. Zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/mL. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding MIC values. Contact bioautography, indicated that Zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Activity-guided fractionation of 1he ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with MIC values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/mL for Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/mL). Zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobials of bacterial strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients hospitalised in intensive care units].
AB  - The aim of the study was estimation of frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of gram-negative rods isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients requiring intensive care, with emphasis on profile of the unit. The analysis comprised strains of gram-negative rods isolated from patients of two intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital (1200 beds). Identification of cultured isolates was done using automated VITEK and API systems (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by a disk-diffusion method according to the NCCLS recommendations. In total the analysis comprised 722 strains of gram-negative rods. In blood cultures predominated strains of Enterobacter spp. (42.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (37.5%). In cultures of clinical specimens other than blood 41.6% comprised strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14.8% Escherichia coli and 14.4% Proteus mirabilis. Frequency of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae was much higher among blood isolates in comparison to strains cultured from other clinical specimens. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of Enterobacteriaceae susceptible to piperacillin and tazobactam (69.0%) and ceftazidime (54.6%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. All strains were susceptible to carbapenems. 2. There was a relatively high percentage of strains of gram-negative rods susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. 3. Bacteria isolated from blood cultures were characterised by a much higher percentage of resistant strains in comparison to other specimens. 4. Longer stay in ICU promoted selection of strains resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. The mechanism of platelet activation induced by LPS is not known. The aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (GSH) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by LPS. The HPLC technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Our results show that LPSs caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (CSH) and cysteinylglycine (CGSH), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. LPS may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of LPSs with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet GSH.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter Italian survey: possible impact on guidelines.
AB  - During 2004 four Italian Laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. A total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. The overall prevalence of Escherichia coli was 85.3%. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. Determination of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of E. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). Cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. The three fluoquinolones tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. Nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. Against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. The results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent Italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of UTI in this country today.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The first beta-lactamase was identified in an isolate of Escherichia coli in 1940. To date, there are >130 TEM-type and >50 sulfhydryl variable (SHV)-type beta-lactamases, mainly in E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis but also in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and in some nonenteric organisms, such as Acinetobacter species. The incidence of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) varies, depending on which area of the globe the isolates originate from. ESBLs render the oxyimino-cephalosporins ineffective, and ESBL-producing organisms frequently also possess resistance factors to other classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and possibly also piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. These results suggest that microbiology laboratories should routinely test for the presence of these strains among their isolates and that the antibiotics of choice for infections believed to be caused by these types of organisms are the carbapenems.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance transformation in community-acquired urinary infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the prevalence of uropathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infection in our environment, and the degree of sensitivity to antibiotics used as empirical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective longitudinal study on 16,392 consecutive urine cultures collected in the emergency department of Hospital del Mar, between January 1997 and December 2001. Resistance rates were compared through variance analysis. RESULTS: 8,743 urine cultures with significant count were obtained. 6,062 Escherichia coli (69.3%), 517 Proteus mirabilis (5.9%) and 390 Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%) were identified. Escherichia coli showed progressive growth rate and significant resistances to most of antibiotics evaluated, especially to quinolones which came close to 30%. Fosfomycin showed the least resistance rate (0.9%) and remained stable along the years studied. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that higher rate of resistance to quinolones does not advise its use as empirical in community-acquired urinary tract infection treatment in our environment. According to our experience, fosfomycin can be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, while for the treatment of parenchymatous urinary tract infection, complicated urinary tract infections, and urinary tract infections associated to risk factors, preference could be second or third generation oral cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated, inducible AmpC beta-lactamase (DHA-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae at a Korean hospital: wide dissemination in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca and emergence in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of recently emerging cefoxitin-resistant and induction-positive isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus mirabilis. Strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at a Korean tertiary care hospital between June and December 2002. Induction was tested using cefoxitin and aztreonam disks, the blaDHA allele was detected by PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were also analyzed. Among the cefoxitin-resistant isolates, 2.7% of E. coli, 21.1% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.0% of Klebsiella oxytoca, and 8.3% of P. mirabilis isolates showed induction, and were blaDHA-1 allele positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaDHA-1 in P. mirabilis. The MICs of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam increased significantly by higher inoculum, suggesting that their clinical usefulness is limited. Presence of multiple PFGE patterns and identical patterns in some isolates suggest that the widely disseminated blaDHA-1 in Klebsiella species was because of both horizontal and clonal spread.
TI  - Prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 10-day regimen of prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily as compared to ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 257 patients (mean age +/- SD 62.3 +/- 16.5) were enrolled and orally treated with prulifloxacin (127 patients) or ciprofloxacin (130 patients). The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled clinical trial. The primary efficacy parameter was the eradication of infecting strains (<10(3) cfu/ml). The clinical outcome and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, the most common infecting strains were Escherichia coli (62.8%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%). At the early follow-up, the rate of patients showing successful treatment was 90.8% in the prulifloxacin group, and 77.8% in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.008). A positive clinical outcome was observed in 94.8 and 93.3% of prulifloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-treated patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. Two patients dropped out for treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The high urinary concentrations of prulifloxacin, combined with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, allow its use in the empiric therapy of UTIs.
TI  - Outbreaks of contaminated broncho-alveolar lavage related to intrinsically defective bronchoscopes.
AB  - From 5 March 2001 to 19 October 2001, outbreaks of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL)  contamination with Enterobacteraceae were detected in our 700-bed institution. We report the investigation of these outbreaks. A case was defined as the occurrence of pairs of specific Enterobacteraceae in BAL specimens among any patients who underwent bronchoscopy in the respiratory unit during the period of the outbreak. Contamination was identified in 117 BAL samples during three outbreaks among 418 patients, and was associated with bronchoscopes 11 and 12 (P<0.001). The other five devices in use were not linked with the outbreaks. During the first outbreak, particular pairs of micro-organisms were associated with a specific bronchoscope (Klebsiella pneumoniae/Proteus vulgaris with bronchoscope 11, and Morganella morganii/Proteus mirabilis with bronchoscope 12). Cultures of sputa from two patients also yielded M. morganii some days after bronchoscopic examination. Isolates from contaminated BAL samples and bronchoscope 11 had similar patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. No further cases occurred after removal of the implicated bronchoscopes. No deficiencies in disinfection procedures were detected and the source of contamination was found to be a loose port of the biopsy channel of the bronchoscope. Our findings underscore the urgent need to test bronchoscopic samples regularly and to improve the design and structure of bronchoscopes.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of a natural fungal population towards pathogenic bacteria. An in vitro study.
AB  - In the present work, we performed in vitro testing of 33 species of fungi of the  subdivision Deuteromycotina isolated from water and sediment of the Kolubara River for antagonistic action towards 11 species of pathogenic bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria, the species most sensitive to metabolic fluid of the fungi were Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei, while the most resistant were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Of gram-positive bacteria, the most sensitive species was Staphylococcus aureus, while the most resistant was Enterococcus faecalis. Of the tested fungi, Penicillium canescens, P. simplicissimum, P. thomii, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. ochraceus, and Fusarium culmorum exerted inhibitory action on the greatest number of species of pathogenic bacteria, while Verticillium lateritium, V. tenerum, Phoma humicola, and Botrytis cinerea had an inhibiting effect on the least number of species.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Longitudinal trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities across long-term-care facilities: emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (LTCF) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. Longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in LTCFs have not been well described. DESIGN: Correlational longitudinal survey study. SETTING: Four LTCFs in Pennsylvania. SUBJECTS: All clinical cultures of residents of the participating LTCFs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. We assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. RESULTS: A total of 4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. A high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. This was especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). In addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. Finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in LTCFs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. These trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae. These findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in LTCFs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.
TI  - Influence of various criteria for elimination of duplicates when calculating the  prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms associated with urinary infections.
AB  - The effect of applying various criteria for elimination of repeated isolates in the same patient on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms frequently associated with urinary infections were analyzed. When time criteria were applied, there was a decrease in the number of isolates of 13.4-27.5%, whereas when variations in antibiotic susceptibility were considered, between 4.3 and 20.3% of the isolates were eliminated. The absolute number of isolates varied considerably depending on which of these two criteria were used, but neither criterion was seen to modify significantly the antibiotic susceptibility of these microorganisms and this confirms the recommendations of the NCCLS for this group of pathogens.
TI  - Microbial resistance to antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections in Mexican children.
AB  - Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in female children. This infection has a prevalence of 4.1 to 7.1% during infancy. The bacterial agents causing the urinary tract infection are Escherichia coil (80-90%), followed by other gram negative germs such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus species and gram positive such as Staphylococcus species. Typical treatment for this infection is ampicillin or the mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMT/SMX) among others. However, a high incidence of microbial resistance to these antibiotics has been observed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the microbial resistance of the most frequent infectious agents in urinary tract of Mexican children from January to December 2000. A total of 725 urinary cultures were collected during all year. Of these, 293 patients were positive of the most frequently reported bacteria including Escherichia coil (205 patients, 69.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (67 patients, 22.8%) and Proteus mirabilis (21 patients, 7.1%). Infections produced by Escherichia coil were highly resistant to ampicillin (83.5%) and TMT/SMX (76.7%). Results indicate a high incidence of microbial resistance to ampicillin and TMT/SMX in urinary tract infections in Mexican children and suggest caution before giving a treatment with antibiotic in this condition.
TI  - Evaluation of a new screen agar plate for detection and presumptive identification of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - A new agar screen plate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection was evaluated with 50 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species: Enterobacter cloacae (n = 10), Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 25), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Fecal samples were artificially inoculated with 2 concentrations (25 and 250 colony forming units [CFU]/plate) of the test strains and then applied to the new agar screen plates. By this approach, the new agar formula detected growth that was suggestive of ESBL activity in 44 of 50 (88%) and 50 of 50 (100%) of ESBL strains with 25 and 250 CFU/plate, respectively. A limitation of the agar screen plates was a lack of some specificity. Among 15 strains with resistant phenotypes other than ESBL (K1 producers of K. oxytoca, 6 strains; 9 strains with AmpC phenotype), growth was recorded in 7 (25 CFU/plate) and 11 (250 CFU/plate) of 15 strains. In conclusion, the new agar screen plate is a sensitive and convenient method to directly screen for ESBL organisms in rectal swabs or stool samples, with the potential for incorporation into routine clinical laboratory service.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates among more than 5000 European Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using Enterobacteriaceae isolated during the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). Of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). Carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all isolates). ESBL-production was confirmed with the ESBL-Etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of Escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6% of Klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of Proteus mirabilis isolates.
TI  - [Infectious spondylodiscitis in a health area of Galicia (Spain) from 1983-2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of infectious spondylodiscitis (IS) in adults of our health area in the late 20 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult patients with a diagnosis of both, tuberculous (TS) and non tuberculous spondylodiscitis (NTS), between January 1983 and December 2003. The diagnosis was made when compatible clinical-radiological picture were present in association with at least two positive blood cultures and/or micro-organism recovery from vertebral samples. Additionally, TS was diagnosed when biopsy showed typical caseating granulomas from vertebral or extra-vertebral lesions. RESULTS: 17 TS and 22 NTS were identified. The mean age was lower in patients with TS than in NTS (43.5 +/- 24.6 vs 52.0 +/- 15.2 years; mean +/- SD). Patients were predominantly males in both, TS (57%) and NTS (82%; p < 0001). The time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was longer in TS (16.4 +/- 15.2 weeks) than in NTS (3.9 +/- 3.2 weeks), p= 0.005. Seven (41%) of the 17 patients with TS had active extra-vertebral tuberculosis. A source of infection was presumed in 20 NTS (90%), mainly surgical spinal procedures (9/22.41%). In three TS and four NTS one o more predisposing factors were observed. The patients with NTS presented a higher prevalence of fever (41 vs 24%; p= 0.0003) and leucocytosis (41 vs 12%; p < 0.001), but less neurological impairment (9 vs 21% p= 0,01). None patient with NTS presented mixed infection and Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen (14/22.64%) follows by Streptococcus sp (6/22.27%). Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were the remain causative agents. Spinal cord decompression and surgical drainage of abscess were performed in five patients (24%) with TS and four patients with NTS (18%), p= 0.0027). Neurological sequels were more common in the patients with TS (24 vs 14%, p= 0.008). The global incidence of IS was 2.2 cases/105 inhabitants/year, which 1.73 cases are NTS. CONCLUSIONS: The IS are a unusual disease what occurs predominantly in male patients. In the last 10 years, a increasing prevalence of NTS was observed, with high contribution (41%) of post-surgical cases. Diagnostic delay is greater in patients with TS and this condition was associated with more neurological sequels.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - [Profile of antimicrobial resistance of agents causing urinary tract infections in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The management of urinary tract infection in children faces the problem of the emergence of resistant strains to antibiotics. The aim of this study is to precise the frequency of the different germs and their susceptibility to antibiotics. METHODS: We report a retrospective study concerning 200 cases of urinary tract infection hospitalised in the paediatric department of Monastir between January 1995 and December 2000. There were 58 boys and 142 girls aged between two months and 14 years with a mean age of 5 years. The frequency of urinary tract infection is 1.85%. RESULTS: The most common causative agent is Escherichia coli in 75.5% of cases, followed by Proteus mirabilis (10%) then by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%). Escherichia coli is predominant in girls, whereas Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are likely encountred in boys. Of all the strains, 96% are resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin, 67% to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and 34% to cotrimoxazole. A resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin is noted in 96% of the germs. The resistance is of 67% for amoxicillin + clavulanic-acid and of 34% for cotrimoxazole. However, third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides remain usually active on the majority of strains incriminated in these infections a part from Pseudomonas.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - [Molecular mechanisms of cephalosporin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family].
AB  - Extended spectrum beta lactamase genes were detected by the PCR in 87.6% of 231 Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in medical institutions of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tomsk and Nazran that showed a decrease in their susceptibility to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Alone or in various combinations TEM type beta lactamases were detected in 43.3% of the isolates, 46.8 and 51.2% of the isolates produced SHV type and CTX type beta lactamases respectively. Combinations of 2 and 3 different determinants were detected in 40 and 14% of the isolates respectively. Production of class C beta lactamases was suspected in 28% of the isolates by their resistance to cefoxitin. The gene of ACT type beta lactamase was detected in 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the gene of CMY type beta lactamase was detected in 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. By the NCCLS 100% of the isolates was susceptible to meropenem, 14% was susceptible to cefotaxime, 64% was susceptible to cefepime, 81% was susceptible to cefoperazone/sulbactam, 47% was susceptible to gentamicin, 57% was susceptible to amikacin and 36% was susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in a pediatric hospital.
AB  - The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was analyzed in Enterobacteriaceae population circulating in the Upper Silesian Child and Mother Health Center in Katowice (USC&MHC). Altogether 1164 clinical specimens, collected from children hospitalized in 8 different hospital units of USC&MHC were investigated. Five hundred and eighty-five clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae were identified in specimens collected from 403 patients. Two hundred and twenty-nine Enterobacteriaceae strains (39%) isolated from 162 patients were found to be putative ESBL producers as revealed by double-disc synergy (DDS) test. ESBL activity was the most prevalent in the population of Klebsiella pneumoniae (77%), followed by Klebsiella oxytoca (50%), Serratia marcescens (43%), Escherichia coli (30%), Enterobacter spp. (18%) and Proteus mirabilis (12%). ESBL producers demonstrated also wide resistance to the non-beta-lactam antimicrobial co-trimoxazole (93%) and the aminoglycosides netilmicin (88%), gentamicin (84%) and amikacin (79%).
TI  - In vitro activity of AVE1330A, an innovative broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Production of beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. Despite the current use of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam, the prevalence of class A and class C enzymes is increasing worldwide, demanding new beta-lactamase inhibitors. Here we report the antimicrobial properties of AVE1330A, a representative of a novel class of bridged bicyclico[3.2.1]diazabicyclo-octanones in combination with ceftazidime. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IC(50) and kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were used to characterize beta-lactamase inhibition by AVE1330A. MICs for >600 strains were determined with the combination ceftazidime/AVE1330A at a fixed ratio of 4:1. RESULTS: IC(50)s of AVE1330A for TEM-1 and P99 enzymes were 0.0023 mg/L (8 nM) and 0.023 mg/L (80 nM), compared with 0.027 mg/L (130 nM) and 205.1 mg/L (1 x 10(6) nM) of clavulanic acid and 0.013 mg/L (40 nM) and 1.6 mg/L (5000 nM) of tazobactam. A highly stable covalent complex led to a low turnover of AVE1330A. MICs of ceftazidime/AVE1330A for Enterobacteriaceae were at least eight-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone. All of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter and Proteus mirabilis strains, including ceftazidime-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 4-8 mg/L. Only 2 mg/L were required to inhibit other Proteeae, Enterobacter, Salmonella and Serratia. CONCLUSION: The combination of ceftazidime with AVE1330A exhibited broad-spectrum activity against Ambler class A- and class C-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). During a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. Fever higher than 38.5 degrees C was significantly more common in the bacteremic group than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. E. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic UTI than non-bacteremic UTI (73% vs 49%; p<0.01). Bacteria other than E. coli (i.e., K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic UTI than bacteremic UTI (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). E. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). Isolates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. The emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic UTI in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome in these conditions.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in an Italian intensive care unit: clinical and therapeutical remarks.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and the epidemiology of ESBL+ microorganisms in an ICU of our Institution over a 5-year period and analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of the infections caused by these microorganisms. The most frequent ESBL+ isolate was Proteus mirabilis (69 isolates, 58%); a high rate of positive results in the double-disk synergy test (DDS) was also recognized for Klebsiella pneumoniae (52 isolates, 51%), whereas this phenomenon was observed less frequently in other species. In 312 cases the isolated microorganism was considered to be the cause of infection; we documented 103 wound infections, 89 UTIs, 62 LRTIs, 30 primary bacteremias, 27 infections of indwelling catheters and 1 CNS infection. The overall mortality rate due to ESBL+ strains was 1%, compared with 10.6% rate caused by ESBL-negative Enterobacteriaceae. This could be explained because ESBL+ strains caused mostly localized infections (wound infections and UTIs), whereas systemic or severe infections were sustained by ESBL-negative strains, and therapy with carbapenems was started promptly after ESBL+ isolation (always within 24h after strain isolation).
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Evolution of acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae in a Tunisian hospital 1993-2001.
AB  - Between January 1993 and December 2001, the overall frequency of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, rose from 2.4% to 7.4%. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent species (56%), followed by Escherichia coli (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (9%). A rate of 49% was observed among isolates from paediatric patients in 1999, caused mostly by outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit of K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis isolates that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of cobalt(II), copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of kefzol.
AB  - Kefzol (kzl), a beta-lactam antibiotic, possesses various donor sites for interaction with transition metal(II) ions [Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)] to form complexes of the type [M(kzl)2]Cl2 and [M(kzl)Cl], with molar ratio of metal: ligand (M:L) of 1:2 and 1:1 respectively. These complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Their IR and NMR spectra suggest that kefzol potentially acts as a bidentate, tridentate as well as monoanionic tetradentate ligand. The complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial species than the uncomplexed kefzol.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Cefotaximases (CTX-M-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (CTX-M-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. The CTX-M-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in Enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Isolates of Vibrio cholerae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Aeromonas hydrophila encoding CTX-M-ases have also been reported. The CTX-M-ases belong to the molecular class A beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. This group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. Typically, the CTX-M-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher MICs to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. Phylogenetically, the CTX-M-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of Kluyvera spp. Insertion sequences, especially ISEcp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes of all four subfamilies. The class I integron-associated orf513 also seems to be involved in the mobilization of blaCTX-M genes. This review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the CTX-M-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - Detection of anti-Proteus antibodies in sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - This study was carried out to determine increased level of antibodies to certain  bacteria in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Fifty RA patients and 25 each of those suffering from osteoarthritis (OA) and healthy controls were tested for antibodies to somatic ('O) and flagellar ('H') antigens of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and for antibodies to 'O' antigen of Klebsiella pneumoniae by standard tube agglutination method. Anti-Proteus antibodies against 'O' and 'H' antigens could be demonstrated in 70% and 64% RA cases respectively, and were statistically significant. Antibodies could be demonstrated against E. coli 'O' and 'H' antigens in 86% and 92% RA cases respectively, and were statistically significant. Against K. pneumoniae 'O' antigen, no antibody could be demonstrated in any of RA and OA cases, and healthy controls. Of the 50 RA patients, 30 had raised CRP levels. Antibodies against P. mirabilis and E. coli antigens appeared to be independent from CRP. Thus a specific elevation in the immune response to P. mirabilis and E. coli has been demonstrated in patients with RA from India.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the Taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (TSAR) program, 2000.
AB  - In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (Taiwan Surveillance of  Antimicrobial Resistance, TSAR), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (TSAR II). This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - Replacement of broad-spectrum cephalosporins by piperacillin-tazobactam: impact on sustained high rates of bacterial resistance.
AB  - We have previously observed a significant reduction of ceftriaxone resistance in  Proteus mirabilis associated with an increase in the use of cefepime, along with a decrease in the consumption of broad-spectrum cephalosporins (CEP). However, we did not observe such a reduction with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Therefore, we sought to determine whether replacement of CEP by piperacillin-tazobactam might be useful in reducing sustained high rates of CEP resistance by this organism. We used a 6-month "before and after model"; during the second (intervention) period, most prescriptions of CEP were changed to piperacillin-tazobactam at the pharmacy. No additional barrier precautions were undertaken. During intervention, consumption of ceftazidime decreased from 17.73 to 1.14 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 patient-days (P < 0.0001), whereas that of piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 0 to 30.57 DDD per 1,000 patient-days (P < 0.0001). The levels of resistance to CEP by K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis decreased from 68.4 and 57.9% to 37.5 and 29.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). We conclude that replacement of ceftazidime by piperacillin-tazobactam might be a suitable strategy to decrease endemic CEP resistance by K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, even where there are high bacterial resistance rates and irrespective of any additional precautions for controlling nosocomial infection.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in Argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 Argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period November 2001-March 2002. Out of 418 Enterobacteriaceae included in the Study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBLs putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of Proteus mirabilis and 25% Escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as ESBLs producers Notably P.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for ESBL producers. ESBLs producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. The isolates considered as amp C beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. Noteworthy only 4% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against Acinetobacter spp (MIC(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). Only 41.7% Acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (MIC(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. The activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). Out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as E.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 E.faecium and 1 E.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. All the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). Regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed MICs of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. Among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (MIC(90) 4 microg/ml).Piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (IE: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in Argentina. Caution must be taken for infections due to ESBL producers considering that the inoculum effect MICs can affect MIC values.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  - In 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the Aquitaine region in France produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Among these were 19 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 Escherichia coli isolates; 3 Proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Providencia stuartii. ESBL producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes and 5 ambulatory patients. Seven different ESBLs were characterized. These mainly consisted of TEM-24 (25 isolates) and TEM-21 (9 isolates), but TEM-15 (2 isolates) and TEM-3, TEM-19, SHV-4, and CTX-M-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. Seven strains showed the coexistence of different TEM- and/or SHV-encoding genes, including a new SHV-1 variant, SHV-44, defined by the substitution R205L previously reported for SHV-3 in association with S238G. The epidemiology of the ESBL producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the ESBL, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the ESBL-encoding plasmids. Of the TEM-24-expressing strains, 18 were E. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in France. Of the TEM-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. Outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. The presence of ESBL producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. Our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in general practice.
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Multiple CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in nosocomial isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from a hospital in northern Italy.
AB  - Twelve isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Proteus mirabilis, and 2 of Proteus vulgaris) classified as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers according to the ESBL screen flow application of the BD-Phoenix automatic system and for which the cefotaxime MICs were higher than those of ceftazidime were collected between January 2001 and July 2002 at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of the San Matteo University Hospital of Pavia (northern Italy). By PCR and sequencing, a CTX-M-type determinant was detected in six isolates, including three of E. coli (carrying bla(CTX-M-1)), two of P. vulgaris (carrying bla(CTX-M-2)), and one of K. pneumoniae (carrying bla(CTX-M-15)). The three CTX-M-1-producing E. coli isolates were from different wards, and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that they were clonally unrelated to each other. The two CTX-M-2-producing P. vulgaris isolates were from the same ward (although isolated several months apart), and PFGE analysis revealed probable clonal relatedness. The bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-2) determinants were transferable to E. coli by conjugation, while conjugative transfer of the bla(CTX-M-15) determinant from K. pneumoniae was not detectable. Present findings indicate that CTX-M enzymes of various types are present also in Italy and underscore that different CTX-M determinants can be found in a single hospital and can show different dissemination patterns. This is also the first report of CTX-M-2 in P. vulgaris.
TI  - The effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid in microbial adherence in vitro.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid (lower than normal plasma levels), on the adherence of five microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) of healthy volunteers. The study reached the following conclusions: 1) the presence of ascorbic acid significantly reduces the ability of all tested strains (with the exception of Klebsiella pneumoniae) to adhere to BEC; 2) ascorbic acid interacts with the epithelial cells and decreases the adherence of all tested microorganisms. These findings may be of potential clinical significance.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamase producing multidrug resistant strains of Klebsiella spp. & Escherichia coli isolated from children under five in Chennai.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: AmpC beta-lactamases are Group I cephalosporinases that  confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs. Plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases has been discovered most frequently in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Salmonella, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. The present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of multidrug resistant and AmpC beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli in children less than five years of age as this age group is very susceptible to intestinal and extraintestinal infections. METHODS: A total of 116 isolates of Klebsiella species and 32 isolates of Esch. coli were tested for resistance to cephamycin such as cefoxitin, third generation cephalosporin (3GC) antibiotics (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), ampicillin, amikacin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, co-trimoxazole, gentamycin, imipenem and tetracycline by disc diffusion method. Isolates found resistant to cefoxitin were tested for the production of AmpC beta-lactamases by three dimensional extract method. Transconjugation experiments were done to study the transfer of drug resistance and AmpC beta lactamase production from AmpC producing Klebsiella and Esch. coli isolates to a recipient Esch. coli strain (K12 J62-2). RESULTS: Twenty eight isolates (24.1%) of Klebsiella spp. and 12 (37.5%) of Esch. coli were found to be AmpC beta-lactamase producers; 66.6 per cent and 81 per cent of Klebsiella and Esch. coli isolates respectively showed resistance to all the 3GCs. All the strains were found to be sensitive to imipenem. Eighty four (72%) of Klebsiella isolates and 20 (62.5%) of Esch. coli were found to be resistant to cefoxitin. Transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain was observed in all the AmpC producing strains of Klebsiella spp. Of the 12 AmpC producing strains of Esch. coli, only 4 (33.3%) showed the transfer of cefoxitin resistance to the recipient strain. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This study has shown the occurrence of AmpC beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella and Esch. coli strains in children in Chennai. Since AmpC beta-lactamase production is frequently accompanied by multiresistance to antibiotics, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of Klebsiella and Esch. coli infections. Also failure to identify AmpC beta-lactamase producers may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and may result in increased mortality. Detecting plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing strains is technically difficult and the phenotypic tests for AmpC detection are not well defined. If an investigational AmpC beta-lactamase inhibitor was made available for diagnostic testing, it could be useful in combination with a suitable cephamycin to confirm AmpC production.
TI  - Pharmacological profile of extracts of Pelargonium sidoides and their constituents.
AB  - In areas of southern Africa, aqueous extracts from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides are employed to cure various disorders. Nowadays, a modern formulation (EPs 7630), elaborated from the traditional herbal medicine, is successfully used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. We previously observed that root extracts of P. sidoides and their representative constituents exhibit moderate antibacterial and significant immunomodulatory capabilities. The present study was performed to further assess the efficacy and mode of action for these pharmacological activities. The results indicate that P. sidoides extracts may well possess antimycobacterial activity as claimed in traditional uses. Furthermore, significant antibacterial properties against multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains as well as TNF-inducing potencies and prominent interferon-like activities in supernatants of sample-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages were observed using several functional assays. In addition, EPs 7630 stimulated the synthesis of IFN-beta in MG 63 cells as demonstrated by a specific enzyme immunoassay. For gallic acid, a characteristic constituent, evidence for the expression of iNOS and TNF-alpha transcripts in stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and, hence, activation at the transcriptional level was revealed by RT-PCR. The present results, when taken together with the recently reported pharmacological activities, provide for a rationale basis of the utilization of EPs 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria from Intensive Care Units and  Urology Services. A nationwide study in The Netherlands 1995-2000.
AB  - A nationwide 6-year surveillance of resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical specimens of patients from ten Intensive Care Units and ten Urology Services was started in 1995. MICs of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin were determined by broth microdilution. Intensive Care Units had higher resistance levels of amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor and ceftazidime (P<0.005) and lower resistance levels of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and quinolones (P<0.01) than Urology Services. Changes in MIC distributions in time and development of resistant clusters were observed for nitrofurantoin (E. coli), amoxycillin (E. coli, P. mirabilis), amoxycillin/clavulanate (E. coli) and for quinolones (E. coli). The overall resistance level of ceftazidime and gentamicin was <5%, but this fluctuated with the appearance and disappearance of resistant clones in some Intensive Care Units. Quinolone resistance among P. aeruginosa from Intensive Care Units fluctuated between 7 and 14%.
TI  - [Community acquired urinary tract infection among hospitalized children in northern Israel: pathogens, susceptibility patterns and urinary tract anomalies].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common diseases in children. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been demonstrated in a substantial number of young children with UTI. Empiric antibacterial therapy is recommended before results of the urine culture are available in order to shorten the duration of the disease and prevent renal complications. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and susceptibility patterns of UTI pathogens, and urinary anomalies in children admitted with UTI. METHODS: The study population included 151 children younger than 14 years admitted with first UTI. Renal ultrasound was performed in all the patients and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children younger than 5 years. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed in children with vesicoureteral reflux. The data included age, sex, symptoms and signs, urinalysis, the pathogen and its sensitivity and the results of the imaging studies. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients (79%) were females. Gram negative rods caused 98% of the infections, of which Escherichia coli (87%) was the most prevalent pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and Proteus mirabilis (4%). The sensitivities to antibacterial agents were: Amikacin 100%, ceftazidime 97%, gentamicin 96%, ceftriaxone 96%, cefuroxime 95%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 84%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 63%, cephalexin 58%, and ampicillin 28%. Renal US showed minor abnormalities in 24/149 (16%) and VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in 38/127 (30%) patients. DMSA revealed renal scars in 7/28 (25%) children with vesicoureteral reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Overall Gram negative rods cause 98% of the UTI in hospitalized children in our area. E. coli is the leading pathogen and aminoglycosides and second or third generation cephalosporins are the most suitable agents for empiric therapy in UTI. A high incidence of renal scars in young children with vesicoureteral reflux was found.
TI  - Is combination antimicrobial therapy required for urinary tract infection in children?
AB  - This retrospective study examined the characteristics of 338 pediatric patients presenting with a first episode of symptomatic urinary tract infection at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from November 1996 to December 2001. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (72.5%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Enterococcus (5.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.7%). They were more susceptible to first-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other first-line antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and gentamicin. Two hundred and eighty-seven (84.9%) of the 338 patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of antibiotic treatment received, and the susceptibility rate and the averaged day of defervescence after effective antibiotic therapy were compared among the groups. Group 1 consisted of those patients treated with cefazolin or cephalexin alone (95%, 2.1 days); Group 2, cefazolin plus gentamicin (88.9%, 2.8 days); and Group 3, ampicillin plus gentamicin (76.1%, 2.3 days). A total of 38 (13.2%) cases from the 3 antibiotic groups did not respond to empiric antibiotics. For non-susceptible infections, when the antibiotic regimen was switched from cefazolin plus gentamicin to ampicillin alone, only 4 (20%) strains became susceptible, compared with 10 strains (62.5%) becoming susceptible after switching from ampicillin plus gentamicin to cefazolin alone (p < 0.01). The results indicated that first-generation cephalosporin alone is an appropriate treatment for pediatric cases of community-acquired urinary tract infection and suggest that antimicrobial combinations should be reserved for serious or critical cases.
TI  - Cytotoxicity responses to peptide antigens in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure levels of IgG antibodies against structurally related synthetic peptides of HLA-DRB1*0404, type XI collagen, and Proteus mirabilis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and HLA-B*2705 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and to determine whether sera from RA and AS patients are cytotoxic for sheep red blood cells (SRBC) coated with HLA-DRB1*0404, type XI collagen, or HLA-B*2705. METHODS: Sera from 51 patients with RA, 34 with AS, and 38 healthy controls were tested against synthetic EQRRAA, ESRRAL, LRREI, and IRRET peptides by ELISA. Sera from patients and controls were also tested for reactivity in complement mediated cytotoxicity with SRBC coated with EQRRAA and HLA-B*2705, LRREI peptides. RESULTS: Antibodies to synthetic peptides containing EQRRAA, ESRRAL, LRREI, and IRRET were significantly increased in RA patients compared with AS patients (p < 0.001) and controls (p < 0.001). The percentage lysis data for SRBC coated with EQRRAA and LRREI peptides were significantly higher for RA sera (p < 0.001) compared to control sera. Percentage lysis for SRBC coated with HLA-B*2705 peptide was significantly higher for AS sera (p < 0.001) compared to control sera. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that antibodies against antigenic determinants of P. mirabilis in RA and K. pneumoniae in AS have cytotoxic properties on structurally related host proteins. These cytotoxic antibodies together with T cell interactions could be relevant in the etiopathogenesis of RA and AS.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - In vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: To evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomanas aeruginosa. RESULTS: All aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index >0.5-4] or synergy (FIC index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. Aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 P. mirabilis, 1 E. cloacae, 1 B. cepacia). Aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (P. mirabilis, E. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (E. cloacae). Aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. CONCLUSION: Additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. Synergy involving aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. Although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.
TI  - Bacteriology of burns at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi.
AB  - A retrospective study to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of burn isolates at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi was undertaken. While a total of 1825 burn patients were admitted to the hospital over a 6-year period (January 1994 to December 1999) only 317 (17.4%) specimens selected from as many patients were processed. One hundred and seventy (170/53.6%) specimens yielded single while the rest (147/46.4%) had multiple isolates giving a total of 535 bacterial isolates. Of this number, 236 (44.1%) were Gram-negatives and 299 (55.9%), Gram-positives. Among the Gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Coliforms/Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common accounting for 94.1% while in the Gram-positive group, staphylococcal and streptococcal spp. predominated (100%). However, the three most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (37.6%), P. aeruginosa (22.4%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (13.6%). While S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were most susceptible to penicillin (33.3 and 64.4% susceptibility, respectively), gentamycin appeared most effective against P. aeruginosa (53.3%). A general broad-spectrum resistance to panels of antibiotics used in the study was however observed among the bacterial isolates. From these results, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, streptococcal spp., P. mirabilis, Coliforms and K. pneumoniae representing 96.4% of all isolates were the most common in the Burns Unit.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - A UK multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the UK to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. METHOD: During 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing UTI were collected from 8 centres in the UK. Isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired UTI in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired UTI other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired UTI in those greater than 65 years old (392). After re-identification, MICs for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using NCCLS procedures and interpretive guidelines. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). The next three pathogens of importance were Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. The activity of amoxycillin against E. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). Cefuroxime was very active against E. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). Cefuroxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of E. coli (96.3% susceptible) and E. faecalis but not against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was highly active against the UTI pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (E. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSION: These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing UTI in the UK.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women in Benin City, Nigeria.
AB  - A semi-quantitative screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria was carried out in the first trimester of 500 consecutive pregnant women in Benin City. The purpose was to provide baseline data and rational therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. Of the 500 women screened, 433 clinical specimens showed significant bacteriuria, representing an incidence of 86.6%. Of this number, 38 (7.4%) were of mixed bacterial colonies while 395 (91%) were of single bacterial colonies. Staphylococcus aureus (29.8%), Escherichia coli (29.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.5%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. The high incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with the observed high proportion of pyuria. On average, sensitivity of the pathogens was ciprofloxacin 99.7%; ceftazidime 81.6%; co-trimoxazole 79.4%; augmentin 71.4%; nalidixic acid 61.7%; nitrofurantoin 61.%; gentamycin 56.9% and ampicillin 25.4%. S. aureus was most sensitive, while Proteus mirabilis was least sensitive among the pathogens. Rational therapy of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women may prevent associated risks such as pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Urinary tract infection trends in Latin American hospitals: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in Latin America between 1997 to 2000 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. In the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. The patients' mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6%). Esherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Among the E. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious UTI in Latin America (91.0-100.0% susceptible). High resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17.5-18.9%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (>45.0%) were observed among the E. coli. In contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of > 87.0%. Against Klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (>30.0%) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against Klebsiella spp. (72.1-88.6% susceptible) and the P. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. The results of this survey endorse the importance of Enterobacteriaceae as cause of UTI in Latin America. Our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the Latin American medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region.
TI  - First occurrence of transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase hydrolyzing cefoperazone in multiresistant nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae from two hospitals in Czech and Slovak Republics.
AB  - The occurrence of positive synergy between antibiotic discs of amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefoperazone was registered in two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from hospitals in Czech and Slovak Republic, indicating the presence of genes coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase active also against cefoperazone, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. Sulbactam inhibited the hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cell-free lysates of these strains which substantiates its use in combination with cefoperazone. Resistance to cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime and aztreonam was transferred from K. pneumoniae isolates to Escherichia coli K-12 3110 and to Proteus mirabilis P-38 recipient strains.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Vietnam.
AB  - Among 730 Escherichia coli, 438 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 141 Proteus mirabilis  isolates obtained between September 2000 and September 2001 in seven hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 26.6% were resistant to ceftazidime, 30% were resistant to cefotaxime, 31.5% were resistant to ceftriaxone, 15.9% were resistant to cefoperazone, and 6% were resistant to cefepime. Resistance to imipenem was found in 5.6% of the isolates. In 55 strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (32 E. coli isolates, 13 K. pneumoniae isolates, and 10 P. mirabilis isolates), structural genes for VEB-1 (25.5%), CTX-M (25.5%), SHV (38.1%), and TEM (76.3%) enzymes were detected alone or in combination. Sequencing of the PCR products obtained from the K. pneumoniae isolates revealed the presence of bla(VEB-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-17), bla(SHV-2), and bla(TEM-1). Molecular typing of the strains with a similar resistance phenotype to broad-spectrum cephalosporins indicated polyclonal spread. ISEcp1 was presumably responsible for dissemination of the bla(CTX-M-like) gene.
TI  - The inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waaE gene: function and genetic distribution among some Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - To determine the function of the waaE gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  LPS of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a waaE non-polar mutant has been constructed. Data obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of LPS samples obtained from the wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waaE gene is involved in substitution of alpha-L-glycero-D-manno-heptopyranose I (L,D-HeppI) at the O-4 position by a beta-D-glucopyranose (beta-D-Glcp) residue. In addition, DNA amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waaE homologues located between the waaA and coaD genes are present in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI (K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes of unknown LPS-core structures. Complementation studies using non-polar waaE mutants prove that all the waaE homologues perform the same function. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. mirabilis non-polar waaE mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. In addition, the Ser. marcescens and P. murabilis waaE mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. All these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waaE gene independently of its origin. An easy DNA amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI] in the inner-core LPS of Enterobacteriaceae members with unknown LPS-core structures.
TI  - Characterization of CMY-type beta-lactamases in clinical strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in four hospitals in the Paris area.
AB  - We isolated five clinical strains (three Proteus mirabilis and two Klebsiella pneumoniae) with beta-lactam resistance phenotypes consistent with production of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. The predicted amino acid sequences of the enzymes were typical of class C beta-lactamases. The enzymes were identified as CMY-2, CMY-4 and a new CMY-variant beta-lactamase, CMY-12. The AmpC beta-lactamases from the two K. pneumoniae isolates were found to be encoded on self-transferable plasmids. The genes encoding the AmpC-type beta-lactamase produced by the three P. mirabilis isolates were chromosomal. Four of the five clinical isolates were from patients transferred from Greece, Algeria and Egypt; one of the K. pneumoniae strains was recovered from a French patient. PFGE analysis and rep-PCR fingerprinting showed that the two P. mirabilis isolates from Greek patients were closely related.
TI  - Infestation of fish-culturing communities with fish-borne bacteria: the Ghanaian  case.
AB  - Twenty different bacterial species were isolated from fishermen and members of communities associated with seven fish ponds with different fertilizer treatments, and an open system. The number and types of the bacterial species were different for the different ponds. Generally, neither the geographical location of the ponds nor the type of fertilizer used could be related to the bacterial flora. Escherichia coli was the predominant species in all the communities, while Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp., Shigella sp. or Streptococcus faecalis were common in individuals of communities of sewage-fed pond.
TI  - Infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and healthy control subjects. METHODS: Sixty four patients with previous AAU and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. Serum antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for Salmonella and Yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for C pneumoniae DNA with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. In logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of AAU was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies (p=0.04). None of the PBMC samples of the patients were positive for Yersinia or Salmonella antigens. C pneumoniae PCR was positive in a patient who was negative for C pneumoniae antibodies. CONCLUSION: Although neither the prevalence nor the levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of AAU compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  - We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) The MIC50 and MIC90 values of PZFX against clinically isolated Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. PZFX showed broad spectrum activity. The antibacterial activities of PZFX against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS)-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone, IPM/CS, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) PZFX showed superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa to those of CAZ and IPM/CS after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) CAZ and IPM/CS had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of MIC against P. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while PZFX exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) PZFX inhibited both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from S. aureus at nearly the same level. PZFX showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) PZFX mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of CAZ with following infection model caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, CMC pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) Intravenous administration of PZFX with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Development of an ELISA using a recombinant 41 kDa partial protein (P45N') for the detection of Riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  - Riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to facilitate early detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks. The antigen used was a recombinant 41 kDa N-terminal fragment (rP45N') of a newly characterized R. anatipestifer potential surface protein, P45, which was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. The rP45N'-based ELISA successfully detected P45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain. Antibodies to P45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of White Pekin ducks which were imported into Singapore from three different farms. Successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). The rP45N'-GST antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pastuerella multocida, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Serratia maccescens, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, the DNA sequence encoding P45 was detected in R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain, suggesting that P45 is probably also universally expressed in these R. anatipestifer serotypes. Thus, the ELISA described is applicable to the detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks.
TI  - Pathology of a mouse model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - A colony of knockout mice (gene designation Cybb tm1) has been maintained at this institution for 5 years. These mice are lacking the b subunit of NADPH oxidase and are susceptible to experimental infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. The purpose of this study was to document the spontaneous diseases present in these mice which are a murine model of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease and to compare these lesions to those of chronic granulomatous disease in humans. Lesions were documented in 72 mice submitted to the necropsy service. All 72 mice had an acidophilic macrophage pneumonia, and 16 also had lobar suppurative and necrotizing pneumonias caused by Paecilomyces sp. (11 of the 16 mice), A. fumigatus (3 mice), Rhizopus sp. (1 mouse), or Candida guilliermondii (1 mouse). Of the 72 animals, 36 had severe bacterial suppurative and necrotizing to pyogranulomatous pneumonias; lung abscesses yielded cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Enterococcus (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), S. xylosus (n = 1), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. (n = 4), gram-negative enteric bacilli (n = 6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Thirteen mice had a necrotizing and suppurative adenitis of the cervical lymph nodes caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp.; S. aureus, S. xylosus, and S. equorum were recovered from abscesses in the cervical lymph nodes, extremities, and head. Splenomegaly was found in 30 animals and lymphadenopathy in 11 mice. The array of spontaneously occurring infectious diseases and lesions in these mice is similar to that of human patients with chronic granulomatous disease.
TI  - Evaluation of a new Etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  - Several Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (IP) or ceftazidime (TZ) MICs in the presence of EDTA or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The Etest metallo-beta-lactamase (Etest MBL) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of IP or TZ (4 to 256 microg/ml) and IP or TZ (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of EDTA or MPA. The prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, Isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and Mueller-Hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), Aeromonas spp. (n = 8), Chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Serratia spp. (n = 10), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), Sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). PCR analysis using specific primers for IMP-1, L1, CcrA, and bla(B/C) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. Enzyme assays were also performed with IP as an indicator substrate followed by EDTA inhibition profiles. EDTA was found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. IP was a better than TZ. Mueller-Hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to Isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low MICs for IP. Etest IP plus IP-EDTA with Mueller-Hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). The Etest MBL strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  - Between January 1986 and December 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. To compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). In this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. Its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. Of the pathogens, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by Viridans (V.) streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Other rare organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella Group B and D, Proteus mirabilis, Group B, D, and non-A, non-B and non-D streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. There was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. Of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with V. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with K. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. The timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates to a Glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Collected from a major teaching hospital in Taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. The overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. Isolates of Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. By 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. Interestingly, some strains of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in Taiwan. This resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of S. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. After the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of Enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. Different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was not due to the spread of a single clone. We conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan, especially in recent years. Appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex PCR.
AB  - Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae: an Italian survey.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. A total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten Italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated ESBL producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL producer, followed by K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). However, amongst all ESBL producers, K. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by P. mirabilis (25.7%). All the strains positive to DD tests were confirmed for the carriage of TEM and SHV genes using colony-blot hybridisation (CH). A total of 447 strains (88.0%) were CH-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the TEM-type probe, 30.1% with the SHV-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested produced ESBLs, 42.3% of which were TEM-derived enzymes. More than 20% of P. stuartii, K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. The double-disk test seems to be a useful test to identify ESBL producing strains.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing clinical isolates in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa: regional results from SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-99).
AB  - The frequency of occurrence of ESBL-producing clinical strains varies widely in distinct geographic areas. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence, the preferred substrate, and the co-resistance patterns of the ESBL-producing isolates collected from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program between January 1998 and December 1999. A total of 1,377 Escherichia coli, 678 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 138 Proteus mirabilis isolates were collected from diverse body sites. Using NCCLS criteria, 139 E. coli (10.1%), 171 K. pneumoniae (25.2%), and 2 P. mirabilis (1.4%) had presumptive ESBL phenotypes; 100, 146 and 1 strain respectively were confirmed to be ESBL producers on clavulanate enhancement testing. The frequency of occurrence of confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli by the medical centers varied from 0-1% for centers located in Australia to 13-35% for mainland Chinese centers. The higher prevalence rates (>20%) of ESBL K. pneumoniae phenotypes were observed in all mainland Chinese centers, one Japanese and one Taiwanese center, and in the Philippine, South African, Singaporean and medical centers. The spread of the presumptive ESBL phenotype to the Enterobacter species was observed in nine medical centers. Overall, ceftriaxone and aztreonam were the best substrates for the detection of the ESBL phenotype between both E. coli isolates and K. pneumoniae ESBL phenotypes; however, there was significant variation between countries in substrate preference. Co-resistances to gentamicin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were common throughout isolates collected from most medical centers. Ciprofloxacin resistance rates were very high among isolates collected from Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, and the Philippines. The best coverage against ESBL-producing isolates was obtained with imipenem (0% resistance), followed by amikacin (6% resistance).
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from European intensive care units: data from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme.
AB  - Susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 European ICUs participating in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme (1997-2000). The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), Escherichia coli (19.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and Enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in Turkish, Russian and Italian ICUs (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). The frequency of AmpC-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. Meropenem was more active against Proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). Against Acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). Meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. Meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from European ICUs actively using meropenem.
TI  - Single-dose fluoroquinolone therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing single-dose to 3-day fluoroquinolone regimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of single-dose and 3-day fluoroquinolone treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: Adult women with acute uncomplicated UTI were randomized to receive either a single dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), 3 days of gatifloxacin (200 mg daily), or 3 days of ciprofloxacin (100 mg twice daily). Patients were assessed at four points during the study: before treatment (within 48 hours before the initiation of the study medication), at the end of treatment (by telephone contact on day 3), and twice after treatment completion (5 to 9 days after treatment [test-of-cure visit] and 29 to 42 days after treatment [only patients with a bacteriologic response of eradication at the test-of-cure visit]). RESULTS: The bacterial eradication rate for the single-dose gatifloxacin, 3-day gatifloxacin, and 3-day ciprofloxacin groups was 90%, 95%, and 89%, respectively; the clinical efficacy rate was 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, for microbiologically assessable patients at the test-of-cure visit. Eradication of the most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, was achieved with gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Single-dose gatifloxacin was equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin in both microbiologic and clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose and 3-day gatifloxacin were microbiologically and clinically equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute UTI among women. Single-dose gatifloxacin may offer advantages over 3-day fluoroquinolone therapy for uncomplicated UTI by decreasing secondary use of medical resources and improving patient compliance.
TI  - [Identification of plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1 among various enterobacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella) isolated from a Tunisian hospital (Sfax 997-2000)].
AB  - Because a multiresistant K. pneumoniae outbreak detected in an intensive care unit of a parisian hospital, combined to the production of the plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase ACC-1, a probable importation via a patient was suggested from another country (Tunisia). The investigation was conducted to examine 35 clinical strains of enterobacteria resistant to ceftazidime without synergy towards Augmentin. Other test of synergy with two inhibitors, BRL 42715, Ro 48-5545 was performed by diffusion method and deposit of 10 micrograms of inhibitor on disks containing ceftazidime, cefoxitin and cefotetan. Synergies were obtained suggesting a probable production of ACC-1 type among six isolates of K. pneumoniae (two), Proteus mirabilis (one) and Salmonella (three) issued from different units. The isoelectric focusing on gel revealed at least one band of beta-lactamase activity at 7.8 but also demonstrated the simultaneous production of several probable beta-lactamases including TEM-type, SHV-2 and ACC-1 among S. enterica ser. Livingstone. The PCR of the gene blaacc-1 was positive. The sequencing (1160 pb) of two products showed high identity (99-100%) with the gene blaacc-1 deposited in 1999. Finally the ACC-1 type reported in Tunisia was probably imported in France via a patient. Because a simultaneous synthesis of ESBL and ACC-1 type, its presence may be invisible and need more investigation.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by nosocomial isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from an Italian nationwide survey.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are widespread in hospital settings worldwide. The present investigation was undertaken to assess the distribution and prevalence of ESBLs belonging to the TEM and SHV families in 448 ESBL-producing clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected from 10 different Italian hospitals. The natures of TEM and SHV determinants were identified by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genes. TEM-52 and SHV-12 were the most common variants, and they were found in most hospitals and in several different species. Other less frequent variants included TEM-5, TEM-12, TEM-15, TEM-19, TEM-20, TEM-24, TEM-26, TEM-43, TEM-60, TEM-72, TEM-87, SHV-2a, SHV-5, and SHV-11. Proteus mirabilis was the most common producer of TEM-type ESBLs, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common producer of SHV-type ESBLs. The distribution of TEM- and SHV-type ESBL variants in Enterobacteriaceae from Italian hospitals exhibited notable differences from those from other geographical settings.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - MYSTIC program: summary of European data from 1997 to 2000.
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program  is a global study providing in-vitro surveillance data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. This paper summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and five comparator agents against 13,793 clinical isolates from 31 centers in 10 European countries, 1997-2000. Meropenem and imipenem demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against the tested organisms, including beta-lactamase-producing strains that were co-resistant to quinolones and aminoglycosides. The carbapenems were active against the most frequently isolated pathogens including staphylococci (98-100% susceptible), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (65-82% susceptible) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (98-100% susceptible). Resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins was observed, particularly among Enterobacter species in Southern and Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe showed a high prevalence of AmpC beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains in Russia (2000); 47% and 28% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were AmpC or ESBL-producers, respectively. There was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the four-year period. Meropenem and imipenem appear to remain reliable options for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF THE LEAF EXTRACT OF Lagerstroemia parviflora Roxb.
AB  - The benzene extract of the leaves of Lagerstroemia paviflora Roxb was tested for  its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Gram Positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition Produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic Ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the mycotoxin citrinin obtained from the fungus penicillium citrinum.
AB  - The mycotoxin Citrinin was obtained from the fungus Penicillium citrinum. It was  tested for it's Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against some gram positive strains viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtillis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition produced by the fungal extract against the bacterial strains were assayed and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Italy: implications for resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - An Italian nationwide survey was carried out to assess the prevalences and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Over a 6-month period, 8,015 isolates were obtained from hospitalized patients and screened for resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams. On the basis of a synergistic effect between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefepime, and ceftriaxone), 509 isolates were found to be ESBL positive (6.3%). Colony blot hybridization with bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) DNA probes allowed one to distinguish four different genotypes: TEM-positive, SHV-positive, TEM- and SHV-positive, and non-TEM, non-SHV ESBL types. MICs for each isolate (E-test) were obtained for widely used beta-lactams, combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Among ESBL-positive strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli accounted for 73.6% of isolates. Overall, TEM-type ESBLs were more prevalent than SHV-type enzymes (234 versus 173), whereas the prevalence of strains producing both TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs was similar to that of isolates producing non-TEM, non-SHV enzymes (55 and 38, respectively). In vitro, all but one of the ESBL-producing isolates remained susceptible to imipenem. Susceptibility to other drugs varied: piperacillin-tazobactam, 91%; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 85%; cefoxitin, 78%; amikacin, 76%; ampicillin-sulbactam, 61%; ciprofloxacin, 58%; and gentamicin, 56%. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin was observed most frequently among TEM-positive strains. Since therapeutic options for multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae are limited, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors appear to represent an important alternative for treating infections caused by ESBL-producing ENTEROBACTERIACEAE:
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for the detection of bacterial ATP (Coral, USA). Of these samples, 49% were reported to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were E. coli (47%), Proteus mirabilis (7%), Enterococcus faecalis (6%) and K. pneumoniae (5%). The susceptibility studies showed 37% E. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. Seven strains of E. coli produced ESBL. Thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. Resistance to nitrofurantoin in K. pneumoniae was 38%. P. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% Staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. E. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. Fosfomycin continued to show high activity against Gram-negative bacilli. However, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. ESBL were detected in the isolates of E. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - Enzymatic characterization of TEM-63, a TEM-type extended spectrum beta-lactamase expressed in three different genera of Enterobacteriaceae from South Africa.
AB  - The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, TEM-63, was identified in three separate genera of South African isolates: Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. This paper describes identification of the gene in these isolates and compares relative rates of hyrolysis between TEM-63 and other known ceftazidimases.
TI  - [Monitoring of uropathogens and their susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Samples of urine collected from patients with complicated urology infection and hospitalized to the Moscow Region Research Clinical Institute in 1986, 1991, 1995 and 1999 were analysed. Of 11,444 samples examined, bacteriuria was estimated in 7143 samples. 9786 strains (29 genus) of bacteria were isolated--56.9 per cent as mono culture and 43.1 per cent as associations. Susceptibility to 21 antibiotic was determined by disk diffusion method for 1607 strains; beta-lactamase production was determined in 198 strains, MIC was determined for 41 antibiotics. Gram-negative rods relative amount among pathogens decreased substantially (84.7 per cent in 1986 against 61.6 per cent in 1999), particularly Enterobacteriaceae (74.7 per cent in 1986 against 41.4 per cent in 1999). Nonfermenting Gram-negative rods (NFGNR) relative amount increased (10.8 per cent against 19.2 per cent), along with Gram-positive cocci (19.8 per cent against 64.2 per cent), particularly coagulasenegative staphylococci (CNS) (10.8 per cent against 35.9 per cent) and enterococci (5 per cent against 16.5 per cent) and candida and fungi (0.5 per cent in 1986 against 15.9 per cent in 1999). At the period 1986-1999 the main pathogens in urology infection were E. coli, Enterobacter spp., NFGNR (including P. aeruginosa), Staphylococcus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. The problem pathogens for urological department were the following: E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., NFGNR including P. aeruginosa, CNS, Enterococcus spp., candida and fungi. At the period 1991-1997 Gram-negative pathogens susceptibility to amikacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime was not changed in general, Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci and enterococci) retained the same susceptibility to vancomicin, cefamandol and amoxyclave. Staphylococci were also susceptible to amikacin, imipenem, rifampicin, oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Production of beta-lactamase was registered for 38.7 per cent of CNS, 26.5 per cent of E. coli, 38.5 per cent of K. pneumoniae, 25 per cent of P. mirabilis and 55.6 per cent of P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - Isolation of yeasts and enteric bacteria in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and role of yeasts, enteric gram-negative rods and Enterococcus species in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis, and the antimicrobial effect of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) irrigation. METHODOLOGY: Forty symptom-free root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A the canals were filled with calcium hydroxide for 10-14 days after cleaning and shaping; in group B the canals were irrigated with IKI for 5 min after cleaning and shaping followed by a permanent root filling. Microbiological samples were taken from the canals before and after the chemomechanical preparation and after iodine irrigation (group B). RESULTS: Microbes were isolated from 33 of 40 teeth in the initial sampling. Yeasts were isolated from six teeth, three of them together with E. faecalis. Enteric rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis) were present in three teeth and E. faecalis was isolated from 21 of the 33 culture positive teeth, 11 in pure culture. Growth was detected in 10 teeth of the second samples. Six of the 10 cases were E. faecalis, with five being a pure culture. All third samples (after IKI) except one were negative. The number of microbial cells per sample did not correlate with lesion size. Two flare-ups were recorded, both in teeth with a mixed infection. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of enteric bacteria and yeasts in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis was established. IKI improved the antimicrobial effect of the treatment.
TI  - CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains isolated in Spain (October 1999-December 2000).
AB  - CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens isolated from female outpatients across the US in 1999.
AB  - In the United States, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females, in regions with resistance rates of <10-20%. Unfortunately, current data on regional resistance is often not readily available to physicians and regional variability in resistance remains largely unknown. This report presents antimicrobial susceptibility data for TMP-SMX and three other commonly tested antimicrobials organized by state and region to demonstrate current regional variability in resistance in the US. In the last quarter of 1999, 5739 fresh clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were collected from 202 laboratories throughout the US. Susceptibility testing was performed against TMP-SMX, cephalothin, nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin using broth microdilution. Data were analyzed by patient age and specimen source, and by state and region. In the US as a whole, resistance to TMP-SMX was 16.8% for E. coli, 7.8% for K. pneumoniae, 12.1% for P. mirabilis and 3.0% for S. saprophyticus, but these rates showed considerable regional variation. By state, E. coli resistance ranged from 7.4% in Pennsylvania to 33.3% in Iowa (among states with > or =50 isolates tested). Regionally, resistance for all uropathogens taken together ranged from 8.5% in East South-Central to 22.8% in West South-Central. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated the broadest activity of the antimicrobials tested and was more active than TMP-SMX against all pathogens. Resistance to TMP-SMX among E. coli now approaches or exceeds 20% in some areas. As resistance among uropathogens reaches clinically significant levels in many areas, continued regional surveillance is essential to ensure the provision of effective empiric therapy for urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in South Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was carried out at a General Practice in South Trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. Susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: From 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. Three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. Most males above 50 years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by Proteus mirabilis, 9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. All urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for Citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. The ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. Also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent resistance in bacterial isolates from patients with diarrhea  and urinary tract infection in the Sudan.
AB  - Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed on four-hundred and ninety-seven bacterial isolates from Sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infections. Shigella dysenteriae type I and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli showed high resistance rates (percentage of isolates showing antibiotic resistance) against the commonly-used antimicrobial agents: ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, sulfonamide, and neomycin, and were completely sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Eighteen resistance patterns against nine antimicrobial agents tested were observed in enteric pathogens. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and sulfonamide was the most frequent pattern. The common urinary pathogens, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis showed high rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, streptomycin, and carbenicillin. We recommend that physicians seek updated knowledge of the common antibiotic-sensitivity patterns when starting empirical antibiotic therapy in Sudanese patients with diarrhea or urinary tract infection.
TI  - [Increased antibacterial activity of antibiotics with etonium in vitro].
AB  - The activity of compositions of antibiotics cefasolin, benzylpenicillin and gentamycin with etonium in respect to museum strains Staphylococcus aureus 209, Escherichia coli K-12, Proteus vulgaris 410, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19, Klebsiella pneumoniae 5054 and polyresistance strains S. aureus, E. coli, P. mirabilis in vitro was researched. The increase of the compositions activity as a result of synergy in the action of their component 4 up to 4496 times has been established.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity in normal and diseased captive bustards.
AB  - A survey was carried out to describe the normal aerobic bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata), kori bustards (Ardeotis kori), and white-bellied bustards (Eupodotis senegalensis) maintained at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. A total of 58 samples were examined from the nasal cavity and 55 samples from the conjunctiva of healthy bustards. There was no bacterial growth in 45% of conjunctival samples. Bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of healthy birds included Micrococcus spp., Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus warneri, Bacillus spp., and Enterobacter amigenus. Bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of healthy birds included Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., S. auricularis, S. xylosus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus sciuri, Aerococcus spp., and Providencia rettgeri. These findings were compared with bacterial isolates from bustards with clinical signs of ocular or upper respiratory tract diseases. Mycoplasma spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of 34.3% bustards with ocular discharges. Mycoplasma spp., P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of 74% bustards with upper respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in Klebsiella pneumoniae C3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. The recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coaD genes, as was found in E. coli K-12. PCR amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative K. pneumoniae strains. Partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from E. coli K-12 and/or Salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. Analysis of a constructed K. pneumoniae waaE deletion mutant suggests that the WaaE protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-D-Glc to the O-4 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose I, a feature shared by K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Evidence of in vivo transfer of a plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 and other resistance factors among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The epidemiological study of several multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from five patients demonstrated in vivo dissemination of a 100-kb plasmid encoding the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24 from a clonal strain of Enterobacter aerogenes to different strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Variations in the prevalence of strains expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype and characterization of isolates from Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific region.
AB  - To evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains among species of Enterobacteriaceae, a microdilution susceptibility test was performed with strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella species that were isolated as part of the SENTRY project. The highest percentage of ESBL phenotype (defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] > or =2 microg/mL for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or aztreonam) was detected among K. pneumoniae strains from Latin America (45%), followed by those from the Western Pacific region (25%), Europe (23%), the United States (8%), and Canada (5%). P. mirabilis and E. coli strains for which MICs of extended-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams were elevated also were more prominent in Latin America. Testing with ceftazidime revealed more isolates with elevated MICs than did testing with ceftriaxone or aztreonam. ESBL strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem remains highly effective against ESBL strains. Organisms expressing an ESBL are widely distributed worldwide, although prevalence rates are significantly higher in certain geographic regions.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of urine after administration of ofloxacin for 5 days].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin was evaluated in urine over a period of 96 h after oral administration for 5 days of 200 mg twice a day in 12 healthy female volunteers. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of urines were studied for five strains of enterobacterias recovered from urinary infections: two strains of Escherichia Coli Nal-S and Nal-R, two strains of Proteus mirabilis Nal-S and Nal-R, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae Nal-S. Mean urinary concentrations of ofloxacin were very high during the first 12 h following last intake. They were still above 7 mg/l till the 48th hour and above 1.6 mg/l till the 72nd hour. Bactericidal activity of urine was present for 72 h in respect of four strains studied at that time; urine was not bactericidal as regards E. coli Nal-R. After 5 days of oral treatment with ofloxacin (200 mg b.i.d.), urine retains a bactericidal activity for at least 72 h against bacterial strains of urinary tract infections.
TI  - A survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  - One critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. The purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. Seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). The following bacteria were tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter species, and Enterobacter species. Swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. Survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. At 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. At 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. These findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - HLA molecules, bacteria and autoimmunity.
AB  - It has been well established that many diseases are linked to HLA antigens. Two of the most interesting HLA associations may provide some insight into the pathogenesis of rheumatic inflammatory conditions. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 96% of patients possess HLA-B27, whilst the frequency of this marker in the general population is c. 8%. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), >90% of patients possess either HLA-DR1 or some subtypes of HLA-DR4, whilst the frequency of this marker in the general population is c. 35%. The association between HLA-B27 and reactive arthritis (ReA) has also been well established. Furthermore, it has been shown that ReA is triggered by infection via the gastrointestinal tract due to Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter spp. and in the genitourinary tract due to chlamydia. In a similar way, microbiological and immunological studies have revealed an association between Klebsiella pneumoniae in AS and Proteus mirabilis in RA. This article reviews the possible pathological implications of the associations between HLA-B27, K. pneumoniae and AS, as well as HLA-DR1/DR4, P. mirabilis and RA.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during October-December, 1999 was tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. METHODS: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli 87, Klebsiella pneumoniae 54, Pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, Staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant S. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive S. aureus 12), Acinetobacter species 26, Enterobacter aerogenes 9, Proteus mirabilis 5, Proteus vulgaris 2, and Citrobacter species 3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using NCCLS guidelines. The cut-off values of isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. RESULTS: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. Isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the other aminoglycosides tested. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.
TI  - Conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoH of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The rpoH regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from GenBank and compared. In addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH of Yersinia frederiksenii and Proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. Sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters P1, P4 and P5, to the sigma(E) promoter P3 and to boxes DnaA1, DnaA2, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) boxes CRP1, CRP2 and box CytR present in Escherichia coli K12, were identified in sequences of closely related bacteria such as: E.coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In more distant bacteria, Y.frederiksenii and P.mirabilis, the rpoH regulatory region has a distal P1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. Sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria. This study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoH gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. A second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to E.coli.
TI  - Assessment of the capacity of Lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 Lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. Lactobacilli from hemagglutination group III, identified as Lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups II and I (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae KP7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and Staphylococcus aureus SA11 and Proteus mirabilis PM1 were the most resistant. Lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 Lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). P. aeruginosa PA5 was the most inhibited, and Enterococcus species E15 was the least inhibited. There is considerable variation among Lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen growth. Although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - Impact of fluoroquinolone administration on the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli from gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - We assessed the risk factors for acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients. We analyzed stool samples from 204 patients and recovered fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms from 63. Receipt of fluoroquinolone during the month preceding admission was the only risk factor identified, whereas female sex, duration of hospitalization, exposure to indwelling devices, admission from another hospital, and history of infection were risk factors for fecal colonization after day 4.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - [Transfer of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and aztreonam in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases].
AB  - The authors demonstrated the transferability of antibiotic resistance genes in nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from newborn children at the Paediatric University Hospital in Bratislava. Strains were resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. The determinants of resistance (carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam) were transferred to recipient strains of Escherichia coli K-12 and Proteus mirabilis P-38. The transfer of resistance determinant from donor strains was demonstrated by the analysis of the resistance spectrum in transconjugant clones of recipient strains by the method of indirect selection. The ability of production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was demonstrated by the double disc diffusion test. Synergy between clavulanate and cefotaxime, clavulanate and ceftazidime and/or clavulanate and aztreonam indicated production of ESBL by these strains.
TI  - Cefdinir versus cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study was conducted in Europe, South Africa, and Australia to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy and the tolerability of a cephalosporin antibiotic, cefdinir, with those of cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. METHODS: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 5 days of treatment with either cefdinir 100 mg BID or cefaclor 250 mg TID. RESULTS: A total of 661 patients were randomized to treatment. They were 90% female, with a median age of 44 years. There were no clinically important differences between groups in terms of demographic characteristics or symptoms on admission. The most frequently isolated pathogens in admission urine cultures were Escherichia coli (383 patients), Proteus mirabilis (20 patients), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14 patients), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9 patients). Of the admission pathogens with documented susceptibility results, significantly more were resistant to cefaclor (6.7%) than to cefdinir (3.7%; P < 0.003). Significantly more admission isolates of E. coli were resistant to cefaclor (5.1%) than to cefdinir (2.0%; P < 0.007). A total of 383 patients were assessable for efficacy, 196 in the cefdinir group and 187 in the cefaclor group. Clinical cure rates and microbiologic response rates for cefdinir and cefaclor were statistically equivalent at 5 to 9 days posttherapy (test-of-cure visit), using a 95% CI approach. The rate of treatment-related adverse events was higher in cefdinir-treated patients (20.2%) than in cefaclor-treated patients (13.0%; P = 0.025), mainly due to the greater frequency of diarrhea in the former group. However, only 4 patients (1.2%) discontinued cefdinir treatment due to diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Empiric therapy with cefdinir appears to be a reasonable choice for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection in whom cephalosporin treatment is indicated.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in Taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  - During the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. The ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. The male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. The most common causative agent was group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 31.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. Among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. In contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after seven days of age). Ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. The most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. Since 1991, GBS has overtaken E. coli as the leading cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis. This was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - Waste water bacterial isolates resistant to heavy metals and antibiotics.
AB  - Sewage water of Casablanca, an industrial city in Morocco, was studied for microorganisms resistant to heavy metals. Isolates were purified and collected on agar slants to be screened for resistance to heavy metals, including mercury in vitro. The strains that showed high resistance to heavy metals were also studied for their resistance to antibiotics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Results indicated that the strains most resistant to all tested products belonged to Ps. fluorescens, Ps. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus sp. These strains exhibit high minimal inhibitory concentrations for heavy metals such as cadmium (2 mm) or mercury (1.2 mm). Growth of Ps. fluorescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of heavy metals was also determined, and the growth curves indicated that mercury, copper, and zinc present a slight inhibitory action, while cadmium and silver could have a potent inhibitory action on growth compared with the controls. These studies also investigated growth in media containing aromatic compounds as the sole source of carbon. The results demonstrate that these strains could be good candidates for remediation of some heavy metals and aromatic compounds in heavily polluted sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potency of the Leaf - Stalk Extract of Curcuma longa (LINN).
AB  - The methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa LINN, was tested for its minimum Inhibitor concentration (MIC) against Gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative E.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1998 to May 1999. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs, vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) had strong activities. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in 1997. VCM showed the highest activity against MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs of VCM for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active against MRSA with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. Particularly, meropenem (MEPM) showed the highest activity with the MICs of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. Almost all the drugs except minocycline (MINO) showed high activities against Proteus mirabilis. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. MEPM, IPM and gentamicin (GM) showed high activities against Serratia marcescens. Generally, it seemed that resistant strains of S. marcescens had decreased since 1996.
TI  - Respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  - Although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. It has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. Plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (CCF) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (DOC) subjects (PII 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). While no subjects in the DOC group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the CCF subjects were found to be colonized. Oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in CCF subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and higher plaque scores. These results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of COPD may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in Brooklyn, NY: epidemiology and  relation to antibiotic usage patterns.
AB  - In November 1997, all Enterobacteriaceae isolated at 15 hospitals in Brooklyn were collected. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were present in 44% of 409 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Six isolates had reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, including two that were not susceptible to any of the antibiotics tested. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed a commonality of resistant isolates within and between hospitals. The occurrence of ESBLcontaining isolates was associated with cephalosporin usage (P = 0.055). ESBLs were present in 4.7% of Escherichia coli and 9.5% of Proteus mirabilis isolates. It is concluded that ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic in Brooklyn, are spread between hospitals, and may be associated with cephalosporin usage.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the Careggi General Hospital in the period July-December 1996].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. METHODS: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 UFC/ml were examined in our Laboratory from July through December 1996. Inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. Five different ward typologies were taken into account (Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics, Spinal Unit and High Risk Wards). Isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. Antibiotic susceptibility was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. For strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. RESULTS: The results obtained show that bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are Escherichia coli (45.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). Those most frequently isolated among outpatients are Escherichia coli (58.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). As far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned, whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). This implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.
TI  - Occurrence and detection of AmpC beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolates at a veterans medical center.
AB  - AmpC beta-lactamases are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide variety of beta-lactam drugs and that may thereby create serious therapeutic problems. Although reported with increasing frequency, the true rate of occurrence of AmpC beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis remains unknown. We tested a total of 1,286 consecutive, nonrepeat isolates of these three species and found that, overall, 45 (3.5%) yielded a cefoxitin zone diameter less than 18 mm (screen positive) and that 16 (1.2%) demonstrated AmpC bands by isoelectric focusing. Based on the species, of 683 E. coli, 371 K. pneumoniae, and 232 P. mirabilis isolates tested, 13 (1.9%), 28 (7.6%), and 4 (1.7%), respectively, demonstrated decreased zone diameters and 11 (1.6%), 4 (1.1%), and 1 (0.4%), respectively, demonstrated AmpC bands. Cefoxitin resistance was transferred for all but 8 (E. coli) of the 16 AmpC producers. We also describe a three-dimensional extract test, which was used to detect phenotypically isolates that harbor AmpC beta-lactamase. Of the 45 cefoxitin-resistant isolates, the three-dimensional extract test accurately identified all 16 AmpC producers and 28 of 29 (97%) isolates as non-AmpC producers. Interestingly, most (86%) isolates in the latter group were K. pneumoniae isolates. These data confirm that, at our institution, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis harbor plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes.
TI  - [Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae in feces].
AB  - A study was made of 366 feces for detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  producing Enterobacteriaceae from feces. The selective agar was used for modified drigalski agar (Eiken Chemical Co., LTD) with 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime (ESBL screen agar). 92 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 41 Escherichia coli, 15 Citrobacter freundii, 13 Enterobacter cloacae, 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other 12, were isolated from ESBL screen agar. And, R-plasmid that were selected by 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime were transferred by conjugation from two of the 92 strains. These strain were E. coli TH9809927 and Proteus mirabilis TH9808262 that were amplified by "Toho-1 type" primer. The clude enzyme from two strains (donor) and transconjugants were especially hydrolysed cepharoridine and cefotaxime. Accordingly, two strains (0.5%) were detected as ESBL producers. We think that the result of our survey suggests the increase of ESBLs producing bacterial infection in Japan, and believe that there is a trend of infection of its by surveilance of the feces.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - CTX-M-type beta-lactamases: an emerging group of extended-spectrum enzymes.
AB  - CTX-M-type beta-lactamases constitute a novel group of class A beta-lactamases with extended-spectrum properties. They are encoded by transferable plasmids and found in various enterobacteria, mostly Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. CTX-M enzymes share extensive sequence similarity with the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca. They efficiently hydrolyze many newer broad-spectrum oximino-beta-lactams including cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam and are readily inhibited by tazobactam and clavulanate. CTX-M-producing enterobacteria are endemic in Latin America and in some areas of North Eastern Europe. Data on their structure, properties and epidemiology are discussed.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We undertook a microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities to categorize bacteria found in cultures of residents. Culture and sensitivity data were collected on 566 samples from indwelling bladder catheters, percutaneous gastrostomy tubes, nares, stool, wounds, pressure ulcers, and tracheostomies in 25 Nebraska and Iowa facilities. Information was also collected on resident factors (eg, presence of indwelling urinary catheter, prior antibiotic administration) and institutional variables (eg, number of beds, nosocomial infection rates). RESULTS: There were 478 gram-negative isolates, the leading organisms being Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There were 221 gram-positive isolates, the most frequently seen of which were enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the 442 residents sampled in the study, 168 (38%) were taking, or had within the previous month been taking, a systemic antibiotic. Quinolones were the most frequently prescribed antibiotic class. The institutional prevalence of urinary catheterization averaged 6.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Significant antibiotic pressure exists in long-term care facilities, a fact that is reflected in antibiotic resistance patterns. A variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were found in nursing home culture specimens.
TI  - Biochemical sequence analyses of GES-1, a novel class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron In52 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae ORI-1 was isolated in 1998 in France from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in Cayenne Hospital, Cayenne, French Guiana. This strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, pTK1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. The gene for GES-1 (Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B, where this pI-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kDa molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to ceftazidime). GES-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase GN79 from Proteus mirabilis; with YENT, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from Yersinia enterocolitica; and with L-2, a chromosome-borne class A cephalosporinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). However, a dendrogram analysis showed that GES-1 clustered within a class A ESBL subgroup together with ESBLs VEB-1 and PER-1. Sequencing of a 7,098-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pTK1 revealed that the GES-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named In52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an intI1 gene possessing two putative promoters, P(1) and P(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an attI1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(GES-1), aac(6')Ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrXVb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA4), and aadA2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacEDelta1 and sulI. The bla(GES-1) and aadA2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. This work identified the second class A ESBL gene of a non-TEM, non-SHV series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.
TI  - Characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in North America: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program evaluates international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. We describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from UTIs during the third-quarter of 1997 in North America (United States and Canada), as part of this worldwide program. The isolates were tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. The five most frequently isolated species were Escherichia coli (48.6%), Enterococcus spp. (13.7%), Klebsiella spp. (12.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). For each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. For Gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against E. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). Approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the USA were vancomycin-resistant (88% with Van A). P. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). E. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), K. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single Enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other Enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (Amp C) Stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). These data demonstrated that several UTI isolates in SENTRY hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potency of tannins and related compounds using the microdilution broth method.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a total of 27 tannins and related compounds was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 2 Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), 4 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis), and 2 yeasts (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). The compounds tested were generally found to possess only weak to moderate antibacterial, but fairly high anticryptococcal activities. Attention is given to structure-activity relationships with emphasis on simple galloyl esters, hydrolyzable tannins and proanthcyanidins among this class of secondary products.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - Demographic, clinical, and treatment parameters influencing the outcome of acute  cystitis.
AB  - A meta-analysis of six double-blinded clinical trials was undertaken to identify  risk factors associated with bacteriologic outcome in 3,108 women with acute cystitis. Eleven antibiotic regimens were used, including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. Entry criteria for all studies were identical. Among 2,409 patients who were defined to be valid for efficacy analysis, pathogens included Escherichia coli (78.6%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), and "other" (9%). Causative bacteria were eradicated at the end of treatment in 93% of patients. The following parameters were associated with successful bacteriologic outcome: not using a diaphragm (P = .0041), treatment for > or = 3 days (P = .0043), pathogen not "other" (P = .0043), symptom duration of < 2 days (P = .0096), and African American race (P = .0147). K. pneumoniae (P = .0496) and "other" pathogens (P = .0018) were associated with increased probability of bacteriologic treatment failure. The presence of pyuria (> or = 10 WBCs per high-power field) did not correlate with outcome and was inversely correlated with the finding of > or = 10(5) bacterial colony-forming units per mL of urine (P < .001). This large database identifies new parameters associated with treatment outcomes of acute cystitis and calls into question current clinical trial guidelines.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - In vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant Spanish clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. Isolates were selected when their MIC to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). The following strains were tested: 61 Escherichia coli, 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Proteus mirabilis, 21 Serratia marcescens, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 Staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. Of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. The percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for E. coli, 75% for K. pneumoniae, 71.4% for P. mirabilis, 28.6% for S. marcescens, 75% for E. cloacae, 33.3% for P. aeruginosa, 90.5% for S. aureus and 40% for Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. It was particularly active against S. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with AS, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. The peripheral T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was investigated using FACS analysis and 14 different Vbeta antibodies. In addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma ELISPOT assays. RESULTS: Twins suffering from AS showed cellular hyporeactivity against K pneumoniae, S pyogenes, C albicans in the ELISPOT assays compared with healthy twins. In contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, AS concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their Vbeta repertoire on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective T cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. There are probably other environmental factors that influence disease concordance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Metabolism of L(-)-carnitine by Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Different Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, are able to convert L(-)-carnitine, via crotonobetaine, into gamma-butyrobetaine in the presence of carbon and nitrogen sources under aerobic conditions. Intermediates of L(-)-carnitine metabolism (crotonobetaine, gamma-butyrobetaine) could be detected by thin-layer chromatography. In parallel, L(-)-carnitine dehydratase, carnitine racemasing system and crotonobetaine reductase activities were determined enzymatically. Monoclonal antibodies against purified CaiB and CaiA from E. coli O44K74 were used to screen cell-free extracts of different Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli ATCC 25922, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae) grown under aerobic conditions in the presence of L(-)-carnitine.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Absence of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae antigens within inflammatory bowel disease tissues.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli, listeria, and streptococcal antigens have been found in Crohn's disease tissues. Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. The presence of these bacterial antigens in Crohn's granulomas would be of aetiological interest, while their presence in ulcers alone would be more likely to indicate secondary infection. AIM: To investigate inflammatory bowel disease tissues for the presence of these bacteria. METHODS: Formalin fixed, paraffin processed sections from 53 patients (19 ulcerative colitis, 23 Crohn's disease; 11 normal tissues from cancer resections) were studied by immunohistochemistry. Control tissue consisted of normal human small bowel injected submucosally with either E coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes K2, 3, 17, 21, 26, 36, and 50, and colonic biopsies from a child with E coli 0114 infection. Tissues were stained by Gram-Twort, and with specific antibodies for E coli (Dako B357), L monocytogenes (Difco 2302-50), and K pneumoniae (Biogenesis 5580-5208) using an immunoperoxidase technique. RESULTS: Positive staining for E coli was observed on the luminal surface epithelium and in ulcers in 35% of Crohn's disease patients, 26% of ulcerative colitis patients, and no normal controls. Superficial staining for L monocytogenes was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis only. Staining for K pneumoniae was observed in one case of ulcerative colitis and one of Crohn's disease. No granulomas, giant cells, or germinal centres stained positively for any of the three bacterial antigens. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support a primary role for E coli, L monocytogenes, and K pneumoniae in inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of E coli antigens in ulcers suggests secondary infection in these lesions.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Febrile morbidity in severe and critical ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to define the incidence of febrile morbidity and  its causes in severe and critical ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). For this purpose, we reviewed the medical records of all OHSS patients hospitalized in 16 out of 19 tertiary medical centres in Israel between January 1987 and December 1996. Febrile morbidity was defined as at least one episode of temperature rise above 38 degrees C lasting > or =24 h. A total of 2902 patients (3305 hospitalizations) with OHSS was identified, of whom 196 had severe, and 13 critical, OHSS. Among the 209 patients investigated the incidence of febrile morbidity was 82.3%, of which 20.5% was attributed to urinary tract infection, 3.8% to pneumonia, 3.3% to upper respiratory tract infection, 2.0% to intravenous line phlebitis, 1.0% to cellulitis at an abdominal puncture site, 1.0% to postoperative wound infections and 0.5 % to gluteal abscess at the site of progesterone injection. Non-typical organisms were frequently isolated, such as Pseudomonas, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. No infectious aetiology was found in 105 patients (50.2%). Hypoglobulinaemia was recorded in most patients, while ascitic and pleural fluids aspirated from these patients contained high globulin concentrations. We conclude that infection-related febrile morbidity in severe and critical OHSS is high, and may be attributed to some degree of immunodeficiency associated with loss of plasma globulins to the third space. However, non-infection-related febrile morbidity is even higher and may be attributed to endogenous pyrogenic mechanisms.
TI  - Studies on the formation of crystalline bacterial biofilms on urethral catheters.
AB  - A model of the catheterised bladder was used to test the ability of urease-producing urinary tract pathogens to encrust urethral catheters. Encrustation was assessed by determining the amounts of calcium and magnesium deposited on the catheters and visualised by scanning electron microscopy. Urease-positive Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa failed to raise the urinary pH and form crystalline biofilms. In contrast, strains of Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri generated alkaline urine (pH 8.3-8.6) and extensive catheter encrustation within 24 h.
TI  - Comparison of five days versus seven days of incubation for detection of positive blood cultures by the Bactec 9240 system.
AB  - The specimen capacity of blood culture systems is determined by the length of time that blood cultures are incubated. Since the patient populations served by hospitals vary, individual laboratories should evaluate the relative cost and benefits of different testing regimens for their particular setting. To be cost-effective, the use of a 5-day rather than a 7-day protocol for the Bactec 9240 system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, USA) has been recommended. To evaluate whether the shorter schedule would be appropriate at the Microbiology Laboratory at the National Cheng Kung University Medical Center in Tainan, Taiwan, the yield from 5 days versus 7 days of incubation was compared using a total of 9653 blood specimens collected from 1 April to 30 September 1997. Of the 1848 positive vials, 1822 (98.6%) were positive in the first 5 testing days; only 26 (1.4%) were positive on day 6 or 7. Only five of the latter vials were judged to contain clinically significant organisms: one Cryptococcus neoformans, one Candida albicans, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Proteus mirabilis. Two vials contained organisms whose clinical significance was categorized as unknown, while 19 contained organisms that were considered contaminants. These data suggest that, for the laboratory studied, the 5-day protocol for the Bactec 9240 system is more cost-effective than the 7-day protocol and is adequate for detection of positive blood cultures.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - The prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, over an 11-year period. Fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. The organisms most frequently involved were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter. Rarer pathogens included Citrobacter species, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. All patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. The mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. Other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. Despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.
TI  - A quantitative study of genital skin flora and urinary colonization in spinal cord injured patients.
AB  - This study was performed to define the relation between colonization of genital skin flora and bacteriuria in spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Twenty-seven female and 23 male spinal cord injured patients were included in the study. Patients were evaluated regarding their type of bladder management, educational status, level and degree of the spinal cord lesion. Quantitative cultures were obtained from the perineum labium/dorsum of penis, external meatus of urethra, and urine. We investigated whether the organisms isolated from urine were also present in one or more skin sites in every patient. In total 54 identical bacterial isolates were observed both from urine and one or more skin sites in 43 of the patients. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus stuartii were the most common bacterial isolates. The distribution of identical colonization of genital skin flora with urine were as follows: 30 in urethra, one in perineum, four in urethra and perineum, nine in urethra and labium/dorsum of penis, and 10 in both three skin sites. Identical colonization of both perineum and labium/dorsum of penis with urine were significantly higher in female patients than those of males (P = 0.037, P = 0.003, respectively). No significant difference was found in the presence/distribution of colonization with respect to type of bladder management, educational status, and neurologic status. These results demonstrate the importance of the urethra, perineum, and labium/dorsum of penis as a source of bacteria causing urinary infection in spinal cord injured patients.
TI  - Comparative activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - beta-Lactam resistance on the part of the Enterobacteriaceae causes serious therapeutic problems in our institutions due to their production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESbetaLs). We studied the in vitro activity of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams against 71 clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae which produced TEM- and SHV-derivative ESbetaLs. Of the single drugs and combinations tested, piperacillin/tazobactam proved to be the most effective. Piperacillin/tazobactam was highly active against Proteus mirabilis, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.125 to 16 microg/ml; Escherichia coli (MICs from 2 to 16 microg/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MICs from 4 to 8 microg/ml), while its activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae ESbetaL producers turned out to be closely related to the type and the amount of enzyme produced, the MIC ranging from 1 to 128 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam was stronger than that of ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination shared favorable in vitro activity properties against the ESbetaL producers with imipenem which, however, should be kept as reserve product.
TI  - Carbapenem-induced endotoxin release in gram-negative bacterial sepsis rat models.
AB  - The carbapenem-induced endotoxin release was evaluated using experimental models  of gram-negative bacterial sepsis in Wistar rats. Infections with Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis resulted in an increase of the plasma endotoxin concentration after treatment with ceftazidime and carbapenems including imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem. Except for P. aeruginosa, the plasma endotoxin concentrations after carbapenem treatment were significantly lower than those after ceftazidime treatment. It is noteworthy that treatment of P. aeruginosa sepsis with meropenem or biapenem induced significantly more endotoxin release than other carbapenems and the endotoxin concentrations induced by these carbapenems reached those of ceftazidime treatment. The plasma endotoxin concentrations appeared to correlate with the reduction of platelet counts and the elevation of both glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase values.
TI  - Transfer of resistance to oxy-imino-cephalosporins and of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase productions in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from infected neonates.
AB  - In this communication, we describe the occurrence of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to cephalosporins of all generations and to aztreonam due to their production of Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases (ESBLs), in two hospitals in Slovakia. They were found to transfer the genetic determinants of resistance of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam and of ESBL production to suitable recipient strains of Escherichia coli K-12 No. 3110 and Proteus mirabilis P-38. Six donor K. pneumoniae strains were collected from six prematurely born babies gradually infected with strains of K. pneumoniae resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. All six strains of K. pneumoniae gave an identical pattern in ESBL testing (double-disk diffusion test). The second cycle of transfers to nalidixin-resistant E. coli K-12 No. 185 nal+ also confirmed that all transconjugants were resistant to all beta-lactams tested. We conclude that a single gene was transferred from donor strains which confers 'en bloc' the resistance to the beta-lactams tested. Four strains of K. pneumoniae produced a uniform type of ESBI. Although with different quantitative expression. All transconjugants tested produced identical types of ESBL as did the donor strains of K. pneumoniae. This transfer of an identical pattern of ESBL production was confirmed also in the second cycle of transfers. Cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam were actively hydrolysed (as shown by the relative rate of hydrolysis [Vmax]) by strains of K. pneumoniae as well as by transconjugant colonies and clavulanate inhibited the hydrolysis of these beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. Urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the HPLC assay. The total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. The mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. The antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (UBT), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (E. coli ATCC 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). For the E. coli ATCC 25,922, the organism with the lowest MIC, median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. For the five uropathogens (with increasing MICs: K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis), the UBTs decreased in general, according to MICs, demonstrating the same relations of UBTs for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (P. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher UBTs than enoxacin. The minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (MUBC), as derived from urinary concentrations, and UBTs showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding MBCs as determined in Mueller Hinton broth. In conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as UBTs, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting UBTs followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). A dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. Only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. Therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated UTI could be worth testing.
TI  - beta-Lactamases responsible for resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis isolates recovered in South Africa.
AB  - Although resistance to the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins among members of the  family Enterobacteriaceae lacking inducible beta-lactamases occurs virtually worldwide, little is known about this problem among isolates recovered in South Africa. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins recovered from patients in various parts of South Africa over a 3-month period were investigated for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was evaluated by using the double-disk test, and the beta-lactamases were characterized by spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays and an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points and general substrate or inhibitor characteristics. DNA amplification and sequencing were performed to confirm the identities of these enzymes. The P. mirabilis and E. coli isolates were found to produce TEM-26-type, SHV-2, and SHV-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. An AmpC-related enzyme which had a pI of 8.0 and which conferred resistance to cefoxitin as well as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was found in a strain of K. pneumoniae. This is the first study which has identified organisms producing different extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from South Africa and the first report describing strains of P. mirabilis producing a TEM-26-type enzyme. The variety of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases found among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from major medical centers in South Africa is troubling and adds to the growing list of countries where these enzymes pose a serious problem for antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - An in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - One hundred clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x MIC for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin release determined. Ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for P. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. There was a relationship between morphology and the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. Of all the species investigated, P. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. P. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (P=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). In all strains except P. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (P < 0.05).
TI  - [Risk factors and pathogenic microorganisms in patients with insufficient esophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy].
AB  - It was the aim of the study to find by retrospective analysis of data from totally gastrectomized patients risk factors for the development of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leakage, that may be avoidable or influenced therapeutically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was retrospective involving 838 patients with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the years 1973-1993. In 134 cases leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy occurred. The relative risk for the development of leakage associated with individual parameters was determined by comparing the data from 704 patients without leakage to the data from 134 patients presenting with this complication. For a subgroup of 86 patients with anastomotic leakage microbiological data of swabs taken from the anastomoses were available, which were evaluated with respect to potentially pathogenic bacilli. RESULTS: The overall leakage rate of esophago-jejunal anastomoses was 15.9% (n = 134). The mortality rate during this time period amounted to 14.3%. Leakage was a most highly significant factor for mortality (p = 0.0001). Significant risk factors for leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy were tumors of the cardia, splenectomy, a duration of operating time of more than 5 hours and manual suture technique compared to stapler anastomoses. Tumor unrelated associated disease, tumor stage and a history of other preexisting gastric diseases were not associated with an increased relative risk. At the time of the initial clinical manifestation of leakage the following pathogenic bacilli could be isolated from leaking anastomoses with decreasing incidence: E. coli, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae a.o. The bacterial spectrum has not changed during the observation period of 20 years. SUMMARY: With the exception of the choice of suture techniques the identified clinical risk factors cannot be avoided or influenced therapeutically due to a lack of potentially curative treatment alternatives. In contrast potentially pathogenic bacilli associated with leakage can be prevented from coming in contact with anastomoses thereby preventing infection and leakage.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded ampC-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis (CF09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated MIC of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. Two beta-lactamases with apparent pIs of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. Substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0. Amplification by PCR with primers for ampC genes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii) of a 756-bp DNA fragment from strain CF09 was obtained only with C. freundii-specific primers. Hybridization results showed that the ampC gene is only chromosomally located while the TEM gene is plasmid located. After cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that this ampC gene is close to blaCMY-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions Glu --> Gly at position 22, Trp --> Arg at position 201, and Ser --> Asn at position 343. AmpC beta-lactamases derived from that of C. freundii (LAT-1, LAT-2, BIL-1, and CMY-2) have been found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. This is the first example of a chromosomally encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase observed in P. mirabilis. We suggest that it be designated CMY-3.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae in Dutch patients with ankylosing spondylitis and acute anterior uveitis and to Proteus mirabilis in rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the association between increased humoral reactivity against Klebsiella and HLA-B27 associated diseases could be confirmed in Dutch patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and acute anterior uveitis (AAU). METHODS: Under coded conditions sera from Dutch patients with AS, AAU, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and from HLA-B27 positive and negative healthy controls were studied for IgA anti-Klebsiella (K54) and IgG anti-Proteus antibodies with the indirect immunofluorescence assay on whole bacteria fixed in suspension with paraformaldehyde. Each group consisted of at least 17 sera. RESULTS: IgA anti-Klebsiella antibody titers were elevated in AS and HLA-B27 negative AAU compared to the HLA-B27 positive and negative controls or patients with active RA (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with active RA had elevated levels of IgG antibodies against P. mirabilis compared to every other test or control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the AS and RA patients in terms of serum C-reactive protein levels, although these were significantly elevated in both compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), suggesting that the antibody elevations were not due to a nonspecific inflammatory effect. The same sera were blindly tested with negative results by 2 other centers. The discrepancies are probably the result of differences in the methods used. CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that Klebsiella are involved in the pathogenesis of AS and AAU and that the same might be true for Proteus in RA.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - In vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a Spanish multicenter study.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. More than 90.0% of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. In general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated UTIs. More than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from UTIs, except for P. aeruginosa (31.8%) and Acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. The results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated UTIs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - IgM, IgG and IgA class enterobacterial antibodies in serum and synovial fluid in  patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class antibodies against three Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular types, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, as well as total immunoglobulin concentrations, were measured by enzyme immunoassay and radial immunodiffusion technique, respectively, in paired serum and synovial fluid samples from eight patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis. No clear evidence for intra-articular antibody production against any of the studied microbes was found.
TI  - Ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of Cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.
TI  - Concentrations of prophylactic ceftriaxone in abdominal tissues during pancreatic surgery.
AB  - Ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated after administration as antibiotic prophylaxis for pancreatic surgery. Ten patients were given ceftriaxone (1 g i.v.) 30 min before surgery. Ceftriaxone concentrations in fatty tissues ranged from 2.5 to 6.2 microg/g. Ceftriaxone concentrations were 6.0 +/- 8.6 microg/g in pancreatic tissues, 2.1 +/- 2.5 mg/L in pancreatic fluid, 1179 +/- 1271 mg/L in pancreatic bile, and 18 +/- 16 microg/g in the liver. In fatty tissues, 8-10 patients had tissue levels greater than the MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the 10 patients had tissue levels greater than the MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In other tissues, penetration was greater than the MIC90 for potential pathogens in 50-100% of the patients.
TI  - Multicenter laboratory evaluation of the bioMerieux Vitek antimicrobial susceptibility testing system with 11 antimicrobial agents versus members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A four-center study in which a total of 1,082 recent clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined versus 11 antimicrobial agents with the bioMerieux Vitek susceptibility test system (Hazelwood, Mo.) and the GNS-F6 card was conducted. In addition, a challenge set consisting of the same 200 organisms was examined in each of the four participating laboratories. Results obtained with the Vitek system were compared to MICs determined by a standardized broth microdilution method. For purposes of comparison, susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) were assigned on the basis of the results of both methods. The result of the broth microdilution test was considered definitive. The total category error rate with the Vitek system and the recent clinical isolates (11,902 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 4.5%, i.e., 1.7% very major errors, 0.9% major errors, and 1.9% minor errors. The total category error rate calculated from tests performed with the challenge set (i.e., 8,800 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 5.9%, i.e., 2.2% very major errors, 1.1% major errors, and 2.6% minor errors. Very major error rates higher than the totals were noted with Enterobacter cloacae versus ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate and with P. aeruginosa versus mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. Major error rates higher than the averages were observed with Proteus mirabilis versus imipenem and with Klebsiella pneumoniae versus ofloxacin. Excellent overall interlaboratory reproducibility was observed with the Vitek system. The importance of inoculum size as a primary determinant in the accuracy of susceptibility test results with the Vitek system was clearly demonstrated in this study. Specifically, when an inoculum density fourfold higher than that recommended by the manufacturer was used, high rates of false resistance results were obtained with cell wall-active antimicrobial agents versus both the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Enhanced jejunal production of antibodies to Klebsiella and other Enterobacteria  in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure gut immunity directly in jejunal fluid in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Antibodies against three different Enterobacterias were measured in jejunal perfusion fluids (collected by a double balloon perfusion device) of 19 patients with AS, 14 patients with RA, and 22 healthy controls using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The AS patients had significantly increased jejunal fluid concentrations of IgM, IgG, and IgA class antibodies against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and IgM and IgA class antibodies against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis compared with healthy controls. When compared with the patients with RA, the AS patients had higher concentrations of IgA and IgG class antibodies only against K pneumoniae. The RA patients had higher IgM class antibody concentrations against all three studied Enterobacterias, when compared with the healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced mucosal immune response in these patients. A three month treatment with sulphasalazine did not decrease enterobacterial antibody concentrations in the 10 patients with AS. CONCLUSION: There is strong direct evidence for an abnormal mucosal humoral immune response particularly to K pneumoniae in patients with AS.
TI  - Inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases.
AB  
TI  - [Characterization of plasmids which mediate resistance to multiple antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria of nosocomial origin].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance of 10 strains of gramnegative bacilli (1 Serratia marcescens; 2 Escherichia coli; 1 Proteus mirabilis; 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae; 1 Enterobacter cloacae y 1 Alcaligenes faecalis), isolated from adult patients with nosocomial pulmonary infection at the in-patient facilities of the University Hospital of Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela, have been studied. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations using the dilution method in agar. The study of extrachromosomal genes was carried out by conjugation, bacterial infection with the bacteriophage M13 and curing of plasmid by acridine orange. The plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and analysis of restriction endonuclease digestion was carried out separately using the enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. A DNA probe, derived from the region which encodes the TEM-1 beta-lactamase of the plasmid pBR322 was used for dot-blot hybridization tests. RESULTS: All of the gramnegative bacilli showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin (> 128 micrograms/ml) and 3 strains also showed resistance to gentamicin (> 64 micrograms/ml). Genetic and molecular procedures showed the presence of conjugative plasmids of approximately 54 kb in all the 10 strains. The restriction patterns obtained by using EcoRI and HindIII indicated common DNA fragments in most of the plasmids studied. The dot-blot hybridization tests confirmed homology between the plasmids and the DNA probe used (TEM-1 beta-lactamase). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the gramnegative bacteria of nosocomial origin harbored self-transferable plasmids of approximately 54 kb, which mediate resistance to gentamicin and encode a beta-lactamase of the TEM group.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - [Study of in vitro activity of 3 cephalosporins and their combination with 2 beta-lactamase inhibitors against 4 enterobacteria strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime, cefepime and cefpirome was evaluated alone and in association with two beta-lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid and sulbactam against 65 extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae strains [Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Proteus mirabilis (9), Escherichia coli (11), Enterobacter aerogenes (10)]. The lowest MICs were observed for cefepime and cefpirome used alone. In association with inhibitors cefotaxime was less effective against E. aerogenes. Most isolates of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli were susceptible to all the different tested associations.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at Sao Paulo Hospital--UNIFESP/EPM in June and July of 1992. The species distribution was as follows: Enterobacter sp. (62), Escherichia coli (308), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27), Klebsiella sp. (9), Proteus mirabilis (23), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), Pseudomonas sp. (4), Serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives (7). Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. The antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, DU 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, FK 037, imipenem, meropenem and biapenem. RESULTS: DU 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. It was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. The potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than they were to cefetazidime or FK 037. When testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active than imipenem or biapenem. In addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. CONCLUSION: The new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. However, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Association of gut inflammation with increased serum IgA class Klebsiella antibody concentrations in patients with axial ankylosing spondylitis (AS): implication for different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for axial and peripheral AS?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A role for Klebsiella pneumoniae in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been suggested because faecal carriage of Klebsiella and serum Klebsiella specific antibodies may be increased in this disease. This study has extended the earlier findings by comparing Klebsiella specific serum IgA class antibodies with inflammatory changes in the gut. METHODS: IgA antibodies to K pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis in serum samples of 25 patients with AS, of eight control patients, and of 100 healthy blood donors were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Gut inflammation of the patients was studied by ileocolonoscopy. RESULTS: Increased IgA antibody concentrations to K pneumoniae associated with gut inflammation in patients with axial form of AS. Such association was not seen in patients with peripheral form of AS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide further evidence for the role of K pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of AS. However, at least some of the patients with axial AS without gut inflammation, as well as patients with peripheral AS did not have increased K pneumoniae antibody concentrations, which may be regarded as evidence against the direct role of K pneumoniae in the pathogenesis. The aetiopathogenetic mechanisms in the axial and peripheral form of AS may be different.
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - [Experimental bladder stone production by human uropathogenic bacteria].
AB  - To investigate the formation of infection stones by 5 bacterial species isolated  from patients with urinary calculi, such as Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, a zinc disc was implanted and 10(6) bacteria were surgically inoculated at the same time into the bladder of male Wistar rats (10 rats per group). Urinary pH was measured on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. The rats were killed on day 7 and the bladder examined for the formation of infection stones. Infection stones were formed in all rats inoculated with P. mirabilis (mean stone weight 29.7 mg), and in 60% of those inoculated with S. saprophyticus (9.7 mg). Small bladder stones were formed in 30% of the rats inoculated with K. pneumoniae and 25% of those inoculated with P. aeruginosa. No bladder stones were formed in the rats inoculated with E. coli. Urinary pH was increased by P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus but was unaffected by the other species. In conclusion, P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus play a significant role in the formation of infection stones.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of blood culture isolates obtained before and after the introduction of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of 1658 blood culture isolates to ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents were determined, and compared with the results for isolates obtained before and after the availability of ciprofloxacin in 1989. Only six (0.6%) of 995 Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested; all of the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were isolated after 1989 (P = 0.04). No significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance was found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 124 Staphylococcus aureus isolates prior to 1989, but five (2.4%) of 208 S. aureus strains recovered after 1989 were ciprofloxacin-resistant (P = 0.16). Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat bacteraemic infections have remained relatively low in this Canadian teaching hospital over the past 16 years.
TI  - A national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (LY 163892). Australian Group for the Study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
AB  - A national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 Australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. Loracarbef was the most active agent against Escherichia coli (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of Enterobacter and Serratia. beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 8 mg/l for both species). Streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.
TI  - Antibody responses to gut bacteria in ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Specific immunoreactive anti-Klebsiella antibodies are found in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a significant proportion of whom have occult inflammatory bowel disease. Molecular mimicry between Klebsiella or other bacterial antigens and HLA-B27 has been suggested in the pathogenesis of AS. The specificity of increased immunoreactivity against Klebsiella remains to be assessed against the abundant anaerobic bacterial flora, present either in healthy controls or in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Total immunoglobulin (Ig; IgG, IgA, IgM) immunoreactivity was measured by ELISA against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and ten anaerobic isolates of the predominant normal bowel flora in 35 patients with active AS, 60 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (30 CD, 30 UC), 60 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 60 healthy controls. Ig immunoreactivity to K. pneumoniae was significantly elevated in AS (P < 0.001), CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) patients compared with RA patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, Ig immunoreactivity to P. mirabilis was significantly elevated only in RA patients, compared with the other inflammatory groups (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001). There was no significant antibody response against E. coli or the ten obligate anaerobes in any of the test groups. The data suggested an increased immune response to Klebsiella in patients with AS, UC, CD and to Proteus in patients with RA. The specificity of these responses in some patients supported a possible role for enteric Klebsiella in the pathogenesis of AS and Proteus in RA. The role of Klebsiella in inflammatory bowel disease requires further study.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella, Proteus, and HLA-B27 peptides in Japanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from Japan have antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis and to assess whether such antibodies are activated against peptides sharing sequences with HLA-B27. METHODS: Serum samples from 152 Japanese patients, 52 with AS, 50 with RA, and 50 healthy controls, were tested against 3 bacteria (K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and Escherichia coli) and 3 synthetic peptides (HLA-B27, pullulanase-D, and scrambled pullulanase-D control peptide) by ELISA under coded conditions. Samples were tested for elevations in IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody classes in patients with active AS or RA, in patients with RA with probable disease, and in patients with inactive AS. Disease activity was determined by an elevated serum C-reactive protein (> 10 mg/l) level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 20 mm/h). RESULTS: Patients with active AS showed specific elevations in serum IgA antibody levels against K. pneumoniae compared to patients with RA and controls (p < 0.001). No such elevation was seen in the IgG and IgM antibody classes. Patients with inactive AS showed no elevation in any class of antibody against K. pneumoniae compared to controls or patients with RA. Patients with active or probably active RA showed significant elevations in IgG antibody levels against P. mirabilis compared to AS and controls (p < 0.001). Patients with AS (active or inactive), RA (active or probably active), and controls showed no elevations in any antibody class to E. coli. Both active and inactive AS patients had specific autoantibodies against HLA-B27 peptide compared to patients with RA and controls (active AS: IgG, IgA, IgM, p < 0.001; inactive AS: IgG and IgA, p < 0.001). Patients with active AS had IgG and IgA antibodies against pullulanase-D peptide, which contains a sequence that cross reacts with HLA-B27 compared to controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of AS and RA patients in Japan having specific elevations of antibody to K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, respectively. This suggests that K. pneumoniae in AS and P. mirabilis in RA may play a role in triggering and/or exacerbating these diseases.
TI  - Risk of microbial contamination with multiple use of 5-fluorouracil vials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. METHODS: Ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-FU were determined for each organism. Organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-FU (50 mg/ml) and, after timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C. Plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. RESULTS: The MICs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-FU used by some clinics. After incubation in 5-FU for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis-were still viable. CONCLUSION: 5-FU has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-FU vials are used in multiple dose fashion.
TI  - A bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Morganella morganii at low pH.
AB  - To infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach. In this study, we showed that Y. enterocolitica serotype O8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as pH 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. Acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-pH conditions. Acid tolerance of Helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was not specifically activated by low-pH conditions. A ure mutant strain of Y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea was the sole nitrogen source. Examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that Morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but Escherichia coli 1021, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. Consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases were activated in vitro by low pH with an unusually low activity optimum of pH 5.5. In whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below pH 3.0 for Y. enterocolitica and pH 5.5 for M. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. DNA sequence analysis of portions of the M. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of Y. enterocolitica urease. One region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of Lactobacillus fermentum. This region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases since the L. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low pH optimum for activity.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - Evaluation of 500 gram negative isolates to determine the number of major susceptibility interpretation discrepancies between the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway for 9 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Although the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. In this study, 500 Gram negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. The 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter species. Each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. Eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. The reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48 of 4500 (1.06%). The rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. Of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were Vitek resistant, MicroScan susceptible. Fifteen (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. Disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results. Twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. The broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with MicroScan. However, there was less very major error comparing the Vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. Overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in patients with short-term indwelling.
AB  - Seventy patients (44(62.9%) females) requiring short-term urinary bladder catheterisation at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi formed the study population. Their mean ages +/- SD was 41+/- 26 years (range 13-100 years). The common indications and objectives for catheterisation included keeping the environment dry (41.1%), relieving urinary retention (27.0%) and urinary incontinence (24.3%). Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) was documented in 48 (68.6%) of the patients. The commonest infection organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, the three accounting for 78.6% of the infections. Female gender and increasing age increased the risk of catheter-associated UTI. The risk of having catheter-associated UTI was higher in patients with medical and surgical conditions than in those with obstetric and gynaecology conditions. Patients who were on systemic antibiotics for other conditions acquired UTI less often (27%) than those who were not undergoing antibiotic therapy. The organisms isolated showed marked resistance to commonly available antibiotics. We conclude that UTI, due to resistant organisms, is common in patients undergoing acute urinary bladder catheterisation in our setting and recommend that urinary bladder catheterisation should be avoided whenever possible. In a situation where this is inevitable, closed drainage systems should be used for the shortest duration possible.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - Survey of prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - During the first six months of 1990 and 1994 respectively, 3179 and 2721 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated at the teaching hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were found in 147 isolates, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 37) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 15). TEM-3/CTX-1, SHV-4/CAZ-5 and TEM-24/CAZ-6 were the prevalent enzymes. However, the most frequently involved enzyme in 1990 was TEM-3 (48.6%) whereas in 1994 it was SHV-4 (56.0%). Two salient features emerged from this study: the high frequency of TEM-3 production in P. mirabilis and the production of SHV-4 enzyme, heretofore observed solely in K. pneumoniae, in two other species, E. aerogenes and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) in abdominal tissues during open prostatectomy.
AB  - Ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated at different stages of open prostatectomy. Ceftriaxone was administered as antibiotic prophylaxis, and 15 consecutive patients were given a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg intravenously in 1 min) 30 min before surgery. Ceftriaxone concentrations in tissue were determined at three stages of the surgical procedure; upon the opening of the abdominal cavity, during the prostatectomy, and upon the closure of the abdominal cavity. Samples of the following tissues or sample were assayed: epiploic and abdominal-wall fat; Retzius' space, bladder, and prostate tissue; and urine. During the different stages of the surgical procedure, for all patients, and in the different tested tissues, ceftriaxone concentrations greater than or equal to the cutoff point (4 micrograms/g of tissue) were measured. The highest concentrations were obtained in the bladder (43 +/- 18 micrograms/g) and in the prostate (35 +/- 18 micrograms/g). In fatty tissues, concentrations were between 13 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 8 micrograms/g. All patients (15 of 15) had ceftriaxone levels in tissue greater than the MICs for the potential pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). In conclusion, during open prostatectomy and after the use of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg), high antibiotic levels were obtained throughout the surgical procedure in the tissues potentially involved in postoperative infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - Bacterial reduction of N-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA).
AB  - 1. Contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of NNK metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) than their N-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of N-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. To verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of NNK-N-oxide and NNAL-N-oxide to their respective parent compounds, NNK and NNAL, in smokers with urinary tract infection (UTI), the N-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats treated with [5-3H]NNK and individually incubated at 37 degrees C with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different pH regimens. After incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with radiochemical detection. 3. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. This result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant UTI, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial.
AB  - The aim of this multicentered, prospective and open study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 79 adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) requiring hospitalization. Forty-seven women and 32 men (mean age 54.2 years, and range 21-91) from 4 Argentinean and 6 Mexican hospitals were enrolled. Sixty-one clinically and bacteriologically evaluable patients were treated for a mean of 9.1 days (range 5-15). A favorable clinical response was seen in 83.6% and 80% at early and late assessment, respectively. Bacteriological eradication was achieved in 85.3% and 80% at early and late estimation, respectively. Escherichia coli was isolated in 33 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8, Enterococcus spp. in 7, Proteus mirabilis in 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii in 2. While 21% of all the clinical isolates were resistant to piperacillin, none of them was initially resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, one female patient with a persistent UTI caused by E. coli developed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam during treatment. A 64-year-old man with frontal meningioma developed purulent meningitis due to Enterobacter cloacae after neurosurgery. He was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin and amikacin and because of persistence of fever, he was moved to piperacillin/tazobactam. After 5 days of therapy, he developed coma secondary to intracranial hemorrhage and died. By then, the platelet count was normal (220,000/microliters), but the prothrombin time (19.5 seconds) and the partial thromboplastin time (63 seconds) were significantly prolonged. Our data suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a reliable therapy for complicated, non-complicated, community or hospital-acquired UTI.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Screening of in vitro antibacterial activity from Syzygium Guineense (Willd) hydrosoluble dry extract.
AB  - Diarrhoea is one of the most important causes of infant mortality in the world. As modern drugs are expensive or unavailable in developing countries, many people use traditional medicines in Africa for the treatment of several diseases. In our study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of Syzygium Guineense extract in order to assess its activity on some bacterial strains involved in diarrhoeal diseases and to justify its use. The aqueous dry extract was prepared by decoction followed by evaporating to dryness and tested according to dilution method. This extract showed an antibacterial activity against some bacterial strains: Salmonella E., Shigella D., Shigella F., E. Coli., Enterobacter A. It did not show any activity against Citrobacter F., Proteus M., Klebsiella P. Storage conditions (27 degrees C, glass flask) did not affect antibacterial properties of the extract.
TI  - IgA antibodies in HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are, like reactive arthritis (ReA), strongly associated with HLA-B27. Mucosal infections play a role in the pathogenesis of ReA. To investigate whether these microorganisms are also involved in the pathogenesis of AAU and AS, we examined blood samples from patients with AAU, AS or both, and healthy controls for presence of antibodies against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K 30), Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Proteus mirabilis and Borrelia burgdorferi. The IgA, IgG and IgM classes of these antibodies were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No significant differences were found in the frequency in which these antibodies occurred in HLA-B27 positive patients with AAU or AS and healthy controls. However, IgA antibodies against K. pneumoniae (p < 0.01) and IgA and IgG antibodies against P. mirabilis (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) were detected more frequently in HLA-B27 negative patients with AAU than in healthy controls. The results of this study are in contrast with various earlier reports in which antibodies against Klebsiella strains were more frequently found in patients with HLA-B27 associated ankylosing spondylitis than in healthy controls.
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Changing patterns of susceptibilities of blood, urinary and respiratory pathogens in Hong Kong.
AB  - The incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from blood,  urine and respiratory specimens at a teaching hospital in Hong Kong were studied retrospectively from 1986-1993. The incidence of Gram-positive bacteraemia, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), increased significantly from 33.6 to 47.3% (P < 0.001) while that of Gram-negative bacteraemia fell from 60.0 to 47.0% (P < 0.001). Among blood isolates, methicillin resistance of CNS increased from 17.0 to 58.0% (P < 0.001) and cefuroxime resistance of Enterobacter spp. increased from 21.0 to over 50% (P < 0.01). Among urinary isolates, cefuroxime resistance of Klebsiella spp. (11.0 to 24.0%, P < 0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (32.0 to 75.0%, P < 0.001) increased. Nalidixic acid resistance among Gram-negative urinary isolates, except Proteus mirabilis, rose by three- to sixfold. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated from the respiratory tract, penicillin resistance increased dramatically (2 to 18%, P < 0.001). For respiratory isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin resistance increased from 17.0 to 29.0% (P < 0.001). These data are useful in guiding empirical treatment of nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

TI  - In-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  - Driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation or suspension of driving privileges. The accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. Under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of DUI. In this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. Samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees C for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. Ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. Results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. The rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees C or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. Many of these species were also able to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by fermentation.
TI  - The effect of iontophoresis on bacterial growth in urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. Pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. The effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. RESULTS: When iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [CFU]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. However, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) CFU/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. Iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. It does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1991). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 751 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1991 to May 1992. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.6% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 71.4% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml.

TI  - The detection of raised levels of IgM to Proteus mirabilis in sera from patients  with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - An analysis by ELISA of 100 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive sera selected at random from a collection of sera from patients with various auto-immune diseases and joint pains, and 100 RF-negative sera from the same collection matched by patient age and gender, showed that the RF-positive sera had highly significantly (p < 0.0001) raised levels of IgM antibody, but not IgG antibody, to Proteus mirabilis over those of the RF-negative sera. This response was subsequently found to be associated with sera from patients who clinically had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Sera from the RA patients had significantly greater amounts (p = 0.026) of IgM antibody to P. mirabilis than to the other organisms tested and these values were also highly significantly different (p < 0.0001) from P. mirabilis IgM antibody levels in matched RF-negative sera. Sera from RA patients also had significantly greater amounts of IgA to P. mirabilis (p < 0.0001) and greater amounts of IgM to Escherichia coli (p < 0.0001) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p < 0.0001) than those in matched RF-negative sera. Other classes of antibody to these organisms and all classes of antibody to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not raised in the sera of RA patients over those of RF-negative controls. The IgM response in RA patients was not specific for only one O serotype of P. mirabilis but was associated with all 11 different O serotypes of P. mirabilis tested and those of other Proteus spp. Moreover, the IgM antibodies to Proteus spp. appeared to be independent from C-reactive protein and RF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  - Craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. However, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. One such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. As part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. The results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. The significance of the findings is reviewed.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Conserved amino acid residues in the primary structure of ribosomal protein S20 from selected gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Partial DNA sequences encoding ribosomal protein S20 have been determined for a number of Gram-negative bacteria including three species of Aeromonas, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium and compared to the known sequence from Escherichia coli. The derived amino acid sequence is well conserved, particularly in the C-terminal one-third of S20. In contrast, there is much less conservation of the nucleotide sequence or potential secondary structure in the corresponding mRNA.
TI  - Inhibitory action of metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - Fifty clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against S. infantis, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. The pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. Pyocyanin, the major metabolite of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit Escherichia coli, Proteus spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of P. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. However, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of P. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella spp., up to now. For this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of E. coli, 30 of K. pneumoniae, 30 of S. infantis, 6 of Enterobacter cloacae and 9 of Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - Experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  - The immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator Urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. The preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. It consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: Escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, Rc mutant of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, BALB/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with Urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. A stimulatory effect of Urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. An increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. Lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. At the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. An active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by Gram-negative bacteria was obtained. In conclusion, the results obtained characterize Urostim as an effective immunostimulator. Its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in the sera of ankylosing spondylitis patients with/without iritis and enthesitis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class serum antibodies against the whole Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against K. pneumoniae and E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were studied earlier in the sera of 98 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. In this study the patients were divided into groups according to the clinical picture, i.e. presence or absence of iritis and enthesitis. The previous major finding of increased IgA class antibody levels against the whole K. pneumoniae bacteria in AS patients when compared to the healthy controls was not specifically associated with any single patient group in the present study. However, the patients with iritis had higher levels of IgA class antibodies to LPS of K. pneumoniae and E. coli when compared to the patients without iritis. In addition, the patients without enthesitis had higher level of IgG class antibodies against whole K. pneumoniae bacteria compared to the patients with enthesitis. The increased IgA class antibody levels against K. pneumoniae and E. coli LPS in AS patients with iritis may reflect an inflammatory process in the gut area. Furthermore, there were certain other differences in the immunological parameters between the AS patients with and without iritis or enthesitis and the possibility that they reflect different mechanisms involved in the disease processes cannot be excluded.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in the sera of patients with axial and peripheral form of ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - IgM, IgG and IgA class serum antibodies against the whole Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis bacteria, as well as against K. pneumoniae and E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were studied earlier in two separate patient populations of 99 and 85 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and in 102 healthy blood donors by enzyme immunoassay. In this study the patients were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of peripheral arthritis. The patients with peripheral type AS had increased levels of IgM and IgA class antibodies against K. pneumoniae, whereas the patients with axial type AS had increased levels of IgG and IgA class antibodies to K. pneumoniae, as well as IgA class antibodies against E. coli and P. mirabilis bacteria. Sulphasalazine treatment decreased the IgM and IgA class antibodies in peripheral AS and IgA class antibodies in axial AS against K. pneumoniae LPS. The antibody levels were also decreased against E. coli and P. mirabilis bacteria in the sera of patients with axial AS. The immunological findings in patients with peripheral and axial form of AS were different from each other and thus may reflect different aetiopathogenetic mechanisms for these two types of AS.
TI  - Nosocomial infections caused by selected gram-negative bacteria at the Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit of the Teaching Hospital in Brno.
AB  - In the course of 13 months we monitored the occurrence of strains of P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Kl. pneumoniae, including its indole-positive variant and S. marcescens in patients of the Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit (AICU) of the Teaching Hospital (TH) in Brno. Out of 436 patients hospitalized at that time, 95 (21.8%) were colonized or infected by one or all of the bacterial species studied. Out of those 95 patients, 48 (50.5%) came to the AICU already colonized or infected by one of the studied agents mostly from other wards of the TH or from other hospitals. At the AICU, 32 of them were reinfected or superinfected by one, two or all of the bacterial species studied. Of the 436 hospitalized patients, 79 (18.1%) were newly infected, reinfected or superinfected. By serotyping, proticine production and proticine sensitivity (P-S) typing and phage typing we demonstrated the endemization of some P-S types and phage types of the bacterial species studied and their spreading among the contemporaneously hospitalized patients. The endemic strains of P. mirabilis included P-S types P5/S6, S7, S9 and P5/S6, S7; P0/S9; P1/S2, S11 and P1/S11. The two biotypes of Klebsiella, i.e. K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, were identically sensitive to some of the phages 1, 2, 3, 8 and 106, particularly to phages 2 and 3, or 2, 3 and 106. The isolated strains of Serratia were absolutely resistant to the 26 bacteriophages used.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  - Using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. The bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Rhodococcus equi (n = 4), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and Escherichia coli (n = 3). In addition, two isolates of Enterobacter spp. and one isolate of Streptococcus equisimilis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens were examined. For determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were fixed as limiting values: Trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. As expected, Rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. However, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. According to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. The relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. For strains of E. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. Antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. The radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.
TI  - Antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis in ankylosing spondylitis: effect of sulfasalazine treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make a longitudinal study of antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to assess treatment effects. As a comparison we measured antibodies of 2 other gut associated bacteria, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: In a double blind study in 84 Finnish outpatients with AS before and after 26 weeks' treatment with sulfasalazine or placebo we measured serum antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli and Proteus mirabilis with ELISA: Serum samples of 100 healthy blood donors served as controls. RESULTS: The levels of IgA class antibodies to all 3 bacteria were statistically significantly higher in the sera of the patients compared to the controls. During sulfasalazine treatment significant decreases were observed in concentrations of the IgA class antibodies to Klebsiella and E. coli whereas only a slight decrease was observed in the concentrations of IgA antibodies to Proteus mirabilis. There were no correlations between the clinical and laboratory results observed with sulfasalazine and decrease in concentrations of IgA class antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our results agree with the role of gut associated lymphoid tissue in the pathogenesis of AS, but do not totally exclude Klebsiella pneumoniae as a specific agent contributing to the development of AS.
TI  - Analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable peptidoglycan autolysins of select  gram-negative pathogens by using renaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - For the first time, peptidoglycan autolysins from cellular fractions derived from sonicated cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli W7, Klebsiella pneumoniae CWK2, and Proteus mirabilis 19 were detected and partially characterized by zymogram analysis. Purified murein sacculi from P. aeruginosa PAO1 were incorporated into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel at a concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) to serve as a substrate for the separated autolysins. At least 11 autolysin bands of various intensities with M(r)s ranging between 17,000 and 122,000 were detected in each of the homogenated cultures. Some of the autolysins of the four bacteria had similar M(r)s. The zymogram analysis was used to show that a number of the autolysins from E. coli were inhibited by the heavy metals Hg2+ and Cu2+, at 1 and 10 mM, respectively, high ionic strengths, and reagents known to affect the packing of lipopolysaccharides. The activity of an autolysin with an M(r) of 65,000 was also impaired by penicillin G, whereas it was enhanced by gentamicin. A preliminary screen to determine the relationship between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and autolysins was carried out by using a dual assay in which radiolabelled penicillin V bands were visualized on an autolysin zymogram. Radiolabelled bands corresponding to PBPs 3, 4, 5, and 6 from E. coli and P. aeruginosa; PBPs 3, 4, and 6 from Proteus mirabilis; and PBP 6 from K. pneumoniae degraded the murein sacculi in the gels and were presumed to have autolytic activity, although the possibility of two distinct enzymes, each with one of the activities, comigrating in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels could not be excluded. Some radiolabelled bands possessed an Mr of <34,000 and coincided with similar low-Mr autolysin bands.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - [Multicenter evaluation of oral antibiotics: resistance behavior in 5 Swiss centers].
AB  - The susceptibility of 2196 fresh clinical isolates to twelve different oral compounds was assessed in five Swiss microbiology institutions during summer 1992. A standardized microdilution system including all other material necessary was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. The aminopenicillins (including the beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) were highly active against the streptococci, in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor they covered the majority of the bla+ E. coli and Proteus mirabilis and between 60 to 80% of the Klebsiella spp. and Proteus vulgaris isolates. All the cephalosporins exhibited good activity against the streptococci, they were active against Gram-negative fermentative rods to a varying degree. Cefetamet was also active against many cefaclor and cefuroxime-resistant isolates. A considerable part of the species studied exhibited resistance to doxycycline; the observed resistance of S. agalactia, P. mirabilis, and Morganella morganii agreed with previous findings. Most of the Streptococcus spp. were inhibited by erythromycin and clindamycin. There were only single penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in the five Swiss centers. Taking account of the above particulars the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in Switzerland can be considered satisfactory.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against common intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - The activity of ceftriaxone plus metronidazole against pathogens usually involved in intra-abdominal infections was studied. Metronidazole 1 g and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) were simultaneously administered i.v. over 30 minutes every 24 hours to 12 healthy volunteers for three doses. Serum samples were collected at baseline, just before the last dose, and 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 hours after the start of infusion of the last dose. Serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) were performed in duplicate for each serum sample from 12 hours on. Serum ceftriaxone and metronidazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the elimination rate and half-life were calculated for each antimicrobial in each volunteer. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibiotic for two strains each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis were determined by microdilution. Eleven volunteers completed the study. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole maintained SBTs of at least 1:4. Serum ceftriaxone concentrations remained above the MICs for E. coli, P. mirabilis, and K. pneumoniae, and serum metronidazole concentrations remained above the MIC for B. fragilis throughout the study. Ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole resulted in intense and prolonged activity against E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and B. fragilis.
TI  - Proteolytic activity and fatal gram-negative sepsis in burned mice: effect of exogenous proteinase inhibition.
AB  - Circulating proteolytic activity (PA) increases following burn or surgical trauma. Challenging traumatized mice with the yeast Candida albicans further increases PA. Once a PA threshold has been passed, mortality increases as PA increases. The purposes of this study were to determine (i) if gram-negative bacterial challenge affects circulating PA and mortality as Candida challenge does and (ii) if proteinase inhibitor treatment with aprotinin, antithrombin III, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor decreases circulating PA and increases the survival of burned mice infected with a bacterium. For all bacteria tested (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), burn plus challenge significantly elevated PA and mortality above levels in mice that were only burned or only challenged. Quantitative culture counts indicated that the mice died of sepsis. Proteinase inhibitor treatment of mice burned and challenged with K. pneumoniae significantly decreased circulating PA, decreased the hepatic microbial load, and increased survival. Hence, in traumatized mice challenged with either C. albicans or gram-negative bacteria, a relationship exists between proteolytic load and subsequent septic death. Parallels between these animal studies and human studies are discussed.
TI  - Pre-formed urease activity of Helicobacter pylori as determined by a viable cell  count technique--clinical implications.
AB  - The pre-formed urease activity of three NCTC reference strains and five clinical  isolates of Helicobacter pylori was determined at room temperature (21 degrees C) and 37 degrees C by a viable cell count technique with a conventional urea slope test (Christensen's agar) as well as the commercial CLO-test. The urease activity of two gastroduodenal commensals, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was also tested. H. pylori strains produced positive reactions with viable cell counts of 10(6)-10(8) cfu within 30 min and with counts of 10(3)-10(6) cfu within 2 h. For some strains, smaller numbers of organisms were needed with the CLO-test than with the conventional test, and incubation of the CLO-test strips at 37 degrees C slightly decreased the number of organisms required for positive results. P. mirabilis produced a positive result on urea slopes with an initial inoculum of 10(7)-10(8) cfu at 2 h, but no positive reaction occurred for K. pneumoniae at 12 h, even with an initial inoculum of 10(11) cfu. However, both P. mirabilis and K. pneumoniae gave a positive result after incubation for 24 h with initial inocula of < 10(1) cfu and 10(3)-10(4) cfu respectively. Incubation at 37 degrees C significantly reduced the inoculum size of these organisms required for a positive result after incubation for 4 h when tested with the slopes, but not with the CLO-test. These findings indicate that H. pylori possesses much greater pre-formed urease activity than P. mirabilis and K. pneumoniae. False negative results for clinical detection of H. pylori in gastroduodenal biopsies may be due to small numbers of organisms, especially after treatment with antimicrobial agents, and false positive results may arise from gastroduodenal commensals or contaminants.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.
AB  - Eight episodes of gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in seven patients with hepatic cirrhosis are reported. The patients comprised five women and two men (mean age 59.6 years). The diagnosis was based on a positive culture of specimens obtained by needle aspiration from cutaneous lesions. All patients had grade C cirrhosis according to Pugh's classification. Cellulitis involved the lower extremities in all cases. Five patients developed bullous lesions, three ulcers, two abscesses and two extensive cutaneous necrosis. A single bacterial species was found in seven cases. Organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), Proteus mirabilis (1 case) and Aeromonas hydrophila (1 case). Bacteremia was documented in six cases. Four patients died, death being related to sepsis in three of them. It is concluded that gram-negative bacilli should be considered as possible pathogens in severe infectious cellulitis in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Microbiological study of cutaneous specimens obtained by needle aspiration may be of high diagnostic value in these cases.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in multiresistant gram-negative intensive  care unit isolates.
AB  - Of 107 gram-negative isolates obtained from intensive care units examined for patterns of multiresistance to 16 antimicrobial agents, 54.2% were multiresistant, defined as resistant to three or more test antimicrobials. Ciprofloxacin had excellent activity against all isolates with 93.4% susceptibility. Ciprofloxacin also performed well on multiresistant isolates with 89.7% susceptibility, which included 42.2% inducible Enterobacteriaceae. All six multiresistant ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were resistant to five or more of the tested antimicrobials (mean 9.0), including a highly resistant Proteus mirabilis urine isolate resistant to 14 of 16 agents. The only antimicrobial to which all of the ciprofloxacin-multi-resistant isolates were resistant, was ampicillin, indicating an absence of cross resistance. In addition, ciprofloxacin had excellent activity (100% susceptibility) against Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, two organisms frequently associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.
TI  - [Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) associated with strong alkaline urine].
AB  - Mechanisms for purple discoloration of the plastic urine bag in purple urine bag  syndrome (PUBS) were investigated. Activities of bacterial indoxyl sulfatase catalyzing the conversion of indoxyl sulfate to indigo (or indirubin) were detected in strong alkaline liquid media but not in normal ones. These enzyme activities were particularly high in simple and combined cultures of Proteus mirabilis and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae. These results suggest that occurrence of PUBS is associated with strong alkaline urine as well as urinary tract infections induced by some species of bacteria with indoxyl sulfatase.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. After a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of 17.8 mg/L was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean Tmax). The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) was 1.3 h. In the inflammatory exudate the mean Cmax was 8.9 mg/L at a mean Tmax of 2.0 h and with a mean T1/2 of 1.7 h. The mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. The in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 of 2 mg/L). Loracarbef was also active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s of < or = 2 mg/L). The in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - The effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  - The effect of a direct electric current (10 microA) on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was investigated. When the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. Zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. Bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were similarly affected by the application of a 10 microA electric current. A negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. The results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. This may offer a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Cefepime was active at low concentrations (MIC50 values < or = 0.06 mg/L and MIC90 values < or = 0.12 mg/L) against non-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs were between 0.016 and 16 mg/L; the highest MIC values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, MICs were < or = 0.5 mg/L, but MICs against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. Ticarcillin-sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/L, while cefepime MICs were 8-64 mg/L for strains resistant to ticarcillin. The cefepime MIC50 value for Haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/L. Against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime MICs were 0.5-16 mg/L; MICs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/L). Against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime MIC values were 0.03-16 mg/L; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/L. Streptococci (Groups A, C and G) were sensitive to cefepime with MICs ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/L (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L; MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). The activity of cefepime against Group B streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with MIC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Most enterococci and all Listeria monocytogenes strains had MICs > or = 32 mg/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - Iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  - Fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. Iontophoresis did not depend on electrode type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. All organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. Effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). The data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.
TI  - Characterization of ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae: a multicentre study in 26 French hospitals. Vigil'Roc Study Group.
AB  - During a multicentre study performed in 26 French hospitals, 287 (3.2%) of 9038 Enterobacteriaceae isolated, mainly Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. were classified as ceftriaxone resistant on the basis of an MIC > 4 mg/L or the presence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was present mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae (65 strains, 10.2%) and very rarely in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases conferred low-level resistance to ceftriaxone in nearly 60% of the strains harbouring them, emphasizing the need for routine testing for the presence of these enzymes. Among transconjugants three types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were identified. Those resembling TEM-3 were the most common, but TEM-21, and SHV-4 were also found. Clavulanate and to a lesser extent sulbactam inhibited all the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases encountered in this study.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  - Twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), University of California, Davis, between 1984 and 1989. Characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13 foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. Laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dL), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microL), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microL). Thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. In 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. Microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (TBA) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. Microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. Tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. Cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or postmortem. Virologic examination of TBA, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. Viral culture of TBA from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type II (EHV-II). In addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. Pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. The predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. Many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. The peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. Type II cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  - In order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (CFTM), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from July 1990 to June 1991 and from July 1992 to February 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. The obtained results are summarized below. 1. No CFTM-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. It appeared that Streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were increasing. The former included benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "Extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. The MIC's of beta-lactams against the above PISP or PRSP, and against cephems-resistant E. coli tended to be high, but those of CFTM were relatively low (in most cases). 3. Proportions of strains resistant to cephems, including CFTM among Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri were high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. As mentioned above, CFTM is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. Except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of MIC90's, and as far as MIC80's are concerned, CFTM still is as active as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of crude leaf extracts of Acalypha wilkesiana.
AB  - Water, ethanol, chloroform and hexane extracts of Acalypha wilkesiana leaves were investigated for in vitro antimicrobial activities by agar-diffusion and tube-dilution techniques. The water and ethanol extracts inhibited the growth of standard and local strains of bacteria and fungi including Staphylococcus aureus, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus. The aqueous extract did not exert any inhibitory action on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis while the ethanol extract was active. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts ranged between 0.25 and 32 mg/ml, while the minimum cidal concentrations were between 1.0 and 64 mg/ml. The aqueous extract was found to be static in action while the ethanolic extract was uniformly cidal in effect.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of two different dosage regimens of imipenem in an in-vitro dynamic model.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of imipenem was tested in an in-vitro model mimicking  human serum pharmacokinetics after either 1000 mg im once daily or 500 mg im twice daily. Six recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella group B were used as test strains. Our results suggest that a single daily dose of imipenem 1000 mg im exerts an antibacterial action comparable to that obtained with two divided doses of 500 mg.
TI  - [Histamine release from mast cell induced by main pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infections in Guangzhou area].
AB  - The methodology for isolating rat peritoneal mast cell was established. The main  pathogenic bacterial ultrasonicates of respiratory infection in GuangZhou area have been examined for their ability to release histamine from purified rat peritoneal mast cells. The results were as following: (1) 7 pathogenic bacteria can cause direct release of histamine from rat mast cells. The most effective histamine releasers were P. mira (histamine release percent is 26.89% +/- 6.70%), Strep. Pneu (24.16% +/- 3.71%), E. Coli (20.40% +/- 4.83%) and K. Pneu (17.91% +/- 4.60%). (2) Histamine release initiated by bacterial ultrasonicates was completed within 30 minutes E. Coli differed from K. Pneu induced histamine release was independent of its dose. (3) The products of K. Pneu did not induce histamine release directly and bacterial hemolysin may play a potent role in bacteria-induced release of histamine. Our findings provide some evidence for mechanism by which respiratory bacterial infection can precipitate or exacerbate attacks of bronchial asthma.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  - Bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. Adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. In E. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. On the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as S. epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of the aminothiazolyl cephalosporin RU 29,246.
AB  - A total of 1,007 clinical isolates from a tertiary care center were tested against RU 29,246, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, Augmentin, oxacillin, piperacillin, gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin. Bacteria tested consisted of 479 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 64 pseudomonads, 18 Xanthomonas, 42 other gram-negative bacilli, 56 enterococci and 348 isolates of staphylococci. RU 29,246 showed excellent in vitro activity inhibiting > 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia, Morganella, Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophila, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at an MIC of 0.5-1.0 mg/l. Seventy-seven percent coagulase-negative staphylococci had an MIC of 1.0-4.0 mg/l. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and X. maltophilia were resistant to RU 29,246. Fifty-six percent of the enterococcal isolates were inhibited by 1.0-16.0 mg/l of RU 29,246.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Bacteriology of necrotizing fasciitis: a review of 58 cases.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a relatively rare soft tissue infection that is characterized by rapidly widespread necrosis of the fascia and subcutaneous tissue. Fifty-eight cases were reviewed over a 5.5-year period. The majority of wound cultures were polymicrobial and single culture rate was 18.6%. The facultative organisms were most frequently recovered. The most frequently discovered bacteria were E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group D enterococcus. The overall mortality rate was 48.3%. Early recognition, serial radical surgical debridement and strong and appropriate antibiotics were essential for survival.
TI  - [Phage and serological types of bacteria infecting patients in anesthesiology and intensive therapy (1988-1990)].
AB  - 1736 of biological materials, being taken from 264 patients, were investigated since 1988 to 1990. 1410 kinds of microorganisms were cultured from 999 biological materials, in which the growth of bacterial flora was noticed. Following species were isolated most frequently: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15.39%, Proteus mirabilis 12.91%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10.43% and Staphylococcus aureus 10.43%. The most frequent serological type according to Fisher's scheme was Pseudomonas aeruginosa--immunotype T 3.7 and according to Habs scheme--immunotype P 16. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently sensitive to phages the group II. In case of Klebsiella sp. bacilli, the most predominant strains were not typed either by basic or extended phage sets.

AB  - Proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infection in hospitalized and  catheterized patients, produces mannose-resistant/klebsiella-like (MR/K) and mannose-resistant/proteus-like (MR/P) hemagglutinins. The gene encoding the major structural subunit of a fimbria, possibly MR/K, was identified in two strains. A degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on the N terminus of the Proteus uroepithelial cell adhesin and antiserum raised against the denatured polypeptide were used to screen a cosmid gene bank of strain HU1069. A cosmid clone that reacted with the probe and antiserum was identified, and a fimbria-like open reading frame was determined by nucleotide sequencing. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence of the processed polypeptide, ENETPAPKVSSTKGEIQLKG (residues 23 to 42), did not match the uroepithelial cell adhesin N terminus but, rather, matched exactly the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular size of 19.5 kDa isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a fimbrial preparation from strain HI4320 expressing MR/K hemagglutinin. By using an oligonucleotide from the HU1069 open reading frame, the fimbrial gene was isolated and sequenced from a cosmid gene bank clone of strain HI4320. A 552-bp open reading frame predicts a 184-amino-acid polypeptide including a 22-amino-acid hydrophobic leader sequence. The unprocessed polypeptide is predicted to be 18,921 Da; the processed polypeptide is predicted to be 16,749 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the gene, designated pmfA, displayed 36% exact matches with the mannose-resistant fimbrial subunit encoded by smfA of Serratia marcescens but only 15% exact matches with the predicted sequence encoded by mrkA of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - [Nose and throat carriage in "food handlers"].
AB  - From December 1991 to February 1992, 450 personnel have been investigated for pathogen microorganisms in their nose and throat. The study was performed in the Infectious Diseases Section of Gulhane Military Medical Academy. Pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from 54 nose culture (12%) and 6 throat culture (1.33%). In one person pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from his nose and throat. The difference between the two groups (The nose and throat cultures) was significant at p = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test (t = 6.414). In the nose cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (85.2%), Proteus vulgaris (5.6%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.8%), Citrobacter freundii (1.8%), Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (1.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%). Only one (1.85%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris) in his nasal culture. In the throat cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (50%). Only one (16.6%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) in his throat culture. The same pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus) has been isolated in an only one person's nasal and throat cultures (0.22%). We treated 60 personnel who were nasal and throat carriers according to the results of antibiograms. After treatment, two still had previous pathogen microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus). These two carriers were eradicated by repeating the treatment.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Bacteriologic examinations of patients with burns].
AB  - Bacteriological studies were performed on 189 patients treated during 1985-1989.  800 samples were tested which were taken from various sites of burn wound (3-5 smears from a patient). Surface of burn amounted to 15-86% and degree of burn was IIb/III. In 772 samples, 2073 bacterial strains were found. Most frequent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31%) and Staphylococcus aureus (29%). Remaining strains consisted chiefly of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Serological typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried according to Fisher demonstrated dominance of immunotype T3.7 (43%). Staphylococcal strains were most frequently sensitive to group III phages and/or supplementary phages.
TI  - [Etiologic bacterial factors of infections in patients treated at the clinical anesthesiology ward and with intensive therapy].
AB  - Bacteriological investigations were carried on 264 patients treated in 1988-1990. 1736 samples of biological materials were taken and it amounts to 6-7 samples from each patient. Most frequently isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Proteus mirabilis (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). Serological typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed according to Habs and domination of immunotype P16 (30%) was detected. Majority of isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae were not typable with basic and broadened phage set. One strain was susceptible to phages KI12 and KI27. This phage type was not isolated in Poland before. Staphylococci were most frequently susceptible to group II phages (29%), additional phages (19%) and 15% were not typable with the phage set used. Isolated bacteria were in majority resistant to numerous antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  - Preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. METHOD--The hospital courses of fifty such patients admitted to our Rehabilitation Department from August 1989 to August 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. RESULTS--Forty-five men and ten women were studied. Mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. The commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. Fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. Seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. Upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. There were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. All positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 CFU/ml. The commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION--For bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. The indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. Impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. Hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. Although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
TI  - Brain abscess in infants.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare in infants and their clinical presentation is specific for this age group. Seven cases of brain abscess in infants aged 2-11 months are reported. The underlying cause was meningitis in four, sepsis in two, and unknown in one. Gram-negative organisms were cultured in 6 patients. The abscess size was 5 cm or more in five cases; in four there were multiple lesions. Two abscesses were aspirated and irrigated; four particularly large lesions were drained and repeatedly aspirated and irrigated. One craniotomy was done. There were two deaths, one in the postoperative period and the other 6 months after discharge. Follow-up information is available for four children, showing a good result in only one of them. Formation of an abscess should be diagnosed early, and close ultrasound monitoring or CT scanning in infants with bacterial meningitis and sepsis is essential. The prognosis in cases in which large/multiple abscesses develop is poor.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Klebsiella aerogenes urease gene cluster: sequence of ureD and demonstration that four accessory genes (ureD, ureE, ureF, and ureG) are involved in nickel metallocenter biosynthesis.
AB  - The region located immediately upstream from the Klebsiella aerogenes urease structural genes was sequenced and shown to possess an open reading frame capable of encoding a 29.8-kDa peptide. Deletions were generated in this gene, denoted ureD, and in each of the genes (ureE, ureF, and ureG) located immediately downstream of the three structural genes. Transformation of the mutated plasmids into Escherichia coli resulted in high levels of urease expression, but the enzyme was inactive (deletions in ureD, ureF, or ureG) or only partially active (deletions in ureE). Ureases were purified from the recombinant cells and shown to be identical to control enzyme when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, in every case the activity levels correlated to nickel contents as analyzed by atomic absorption analysis. UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG peptides were tentatively identified by gel electrophoretic comparison of mutant and control cell extracts, by in vivo expression of separately cloned genes, or by in vitro transcription-translation analyses; the assignments were confirmed for UreE and UreG by amino-terminal sequencing. The latter peptides (apparent M(r)s, 23,900 and 28,500) were present at high levels comparable to those of the urease subunits, whereas the amounts of UreF (apparent M(r), 27,000) and UreD (apparent M(r), 29,300) were greatly reduced, perhaps because of the lack of good ribosome binding sites in the regions upstream of these open reading frames. These results demonstrate that all four accessory genes are necessary for the functional incorporation of the urease metallocenter.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/mL; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/mL; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/mL) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. Among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. For anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including Clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Eubacterium. The activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. In these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and C. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of uncomplicated  urinary tract infection.
AB  - A multicenter randomized study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin with that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adults. Patients were randomized to receive either oral ofloxacin 200 mg daily for three days (102 patients), or oral TMP/SMX 160 mg/800 mg twice daily for seven days (100 patients). The pathogen was eradicated in 73 (97.3%) of the 75 evaluable patients receiving ofloxacin and in 66 (97.1%) of the 68 evaluable patients receiving TMP/SMX. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. More urinary pathogens were susceptible to ofloxacin than to TMP/SMX, although this difference was not statistically significant. The clinical cure rate for patients receiving ofloxacin was 93.3%, with 4% improved and 2.7% failed. For patients receiving TMP/SMX, the clinical cure rate was 86.4%, with 12.1% improved and 1.5% failed. Side effects were reported by 29.7% of the patients receiving ofloxacin and by 40.4% of the patients receiving TMP/SMX. Drug-related adverse experiences, as determined by the investigators, occurred in 5% of the ofloxacin patients and in 15.2% of the TMP/SMX patients, a statistically significant difference. No patients receiving ofloxacin, compared with three patients receiving TMP/SMX, discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. These results indicate that short-course ofloxacin is as effective as TMP/SMX in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Ofloxacin therapy is also better tolerated than TMP/SMX.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases by the rapid ATB E technique. Value of the API V2.1.1 expert system].
AB  - Twenty-two extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing strains of enterobacteriaceae recovered in the authors' hospital were tested using the Rapid ATB E coupled with the API V2.1.1. expert system. The expert system detected 90.9% of ESBL-producing strains. Two strains producing a SHV2 and a CTX1, respectively, escaped detection by the expert system despite concomitant resistance to aminoglycosides.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - Effectiveness of cefetamet pivoxil in the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil was investigated in an open, randomized comparative study involving a total of 37 children with acute pyelonephritis, whose ages ranged from 2 to 14 years. The patients received either 10 mg/kg (n = 18) or 20 mg/kg (n = 8) cefetamet pivoxil twice daily, or 30-50 mg/kg amoxycillin/clavulanic acid three times daily (n = 11) for a period of 7-10 days. Escherichia coli was the main causative agent isolated in 28 (75.7%) of the patients; other pathogens included Proteus mirabilis (three patients). Proteus species (one patient), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two patients), Pseudomonas diminuta (one patient) and mixed infections (three patients). No differences in the overall treatment outcome could be observed between the treatment regimens used and, at the end of treatment, all pathogens were eradicated with neither relapse, nor persistence of the isolated pathogen, nor reinfection occurring. The clinical signs and symptoms had subsided in all patients at treatment end and the tolerability of the trial drugs was found to be satisfactory with no premature treatment withdrawal required. It is concluded that cefetamet pivoxil in the standard twice-daily dose of 10 mg/kg was equally effective and as well tolerated as 20 mg/kg cefetamet pivoxil given twice daily or 30-50 mg/kg amoxycillin/clavulanic acid given three times daily.
TI  - IgA antibody response to klebsiella in ankylosing spondylitis measured by immunoblotting.
AB  - IgA antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae var oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis were measured in 66 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 31 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in 51 healthy control subjects, using an immunoblotting technique. The number of antigenic bands to klebsiella on nitrocellulose membrane was higher in 28 patients with active AS than in 38 patients with inactive AS, 31 patients with RA, and 51 healthy control subjects; comparatively smaller increases were found against proteus. In two patients with AS the synovial fluid and the corresponding serum sample showed an identical antibody pattern. Increases in IgA antibodies to klebsiella in patients with AS confirm previous studies using other techniques.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin BK-218.
AB  - BK-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. BK-218 was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher MICs. BK-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. Moderate BK-218 activity was observed against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (MIC90, 1 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 2 mg/l), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC90, 2 mg/l). The following organisms were generally BK-218-resistant (MIC90, greater than 16 mg/l): Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus, Serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - [Evaluation of the ATB 32 E system for automated identification of Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - A new automated system ensuring identification of Enterobacteriaceae within four  hours was evaluated using 269 routine isolates, comparatively with the techniques routinely used in the laboratory. The ATB 32 E system correctly identified 96% (258/270) of strains and yielded incorrect results for 4% (11/269) of strains. ATB 32 E is a reliable system which is easy to use in everyday laboratory work.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Acute anterior uveitis, arthritides and enteric antigens.
AB  - One hundred and fourteen patients with acute anterior uveitis were studied for the presence of the HLA-B27 tissue type, the prevalence of spondylitis and arthritis and the occurrence of gastro-intestinal and urogenital infections or diarrhoeal illness in the history. Eighty-seven (76%) were B27+ and 27 (24%) B27-. Forty-two (48%) of the B27+ group had ankylosing spondylitis (AS); 13 (30%) of them were females. Sacroilitis (SI) with no spinal involvement was present in 21 patients (24%), 13 (61%) males and 8 (38%) females. Peripheral arthritis occurred in 6 patients. Thus, 68 (78%) of the HLA-B27+ positive patients had inflammatory spinal and/or joint disease, compared with 1 (4%) of the HLA-B27- group (p less than 0.001). The AS diagnosis was unknown previous to our examination in 31% of the males and 54% of the females, and SI was undiscovered in 61% of the males and 62% of the females. The occurrence of acute enteric infections was significantly increased in the B27+ AAU group, compared with the B27- patients and the patients reported exacerbation of AAU in connection with episodes of diarrhoea. An increased occurrence of urogenital infections was shown only in co-comparison with the males of the B-27+ AAU group. Thirty-three out of 47 AAU patients assayed by enzyme immuno-assay (EIA) for the quantification of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against Klebsiella pneumoniae, E coli, and Proteus mirabilis had significantly raised antibody titres against one or more of the antibodies studied, as compared to 62 healthy controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Microbiological exploitation of cardiac glycosides and alkaloids from Garcinia kola, Borreria ocymoides, Kola nitida and Citrus aurantifolia.
AB  - The four medicinal plants, Garcinia kola (roots), Borreria ocymoides (leaves), Kola nitida (bark) and Citrus aurantifolia (roots) were screened for phytochemical components. They were found to contain tannins, phlobatannins, polyphenols, hydroxymethyl anthraquinones, glucides, saponins, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavanoids and reducing compounds. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts as well as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides of the medicinal plants were tested on various pathogenic bacteria. They were found to inhibit such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The usefulness of the phytochemical bases of these plants as potential sources of pharmaceutical drug preparation is discussed.
TI  - [Panophthalmitis as a nosocomial infection].
AB  - The submitted paper deals with an epidemic of severe postoperative panophthalmitis, its development, course, causes and sequelae incl. epidemiological characteristics. The disease developed in four patients 40 hours after operation of cataract. Despite treatment all four patients developed septicaemia and therefore the affected eyeballs were eviscerated. From smears of the conjunctival sac of the affected patients and from the contents of the eviscerated eyeball Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloaceae were cultivated. The authors draw attention to the epidemiological association with the eye lotion BSS which was used from which Proteus mirabilis and E. coli were cultivated and with the Ringer solution from which Enterobacter cloaceae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were cultivated. An epidemiological analysis of the epidemic was made and provisions were defined to rule out its recurrence.
TI  - Long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - In most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (BM) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. The search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. In this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of BM was done in two hospitals in Mali and Niger, between March, 1989, and May, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48 h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). The cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). No outbreak occurred during the study period. The hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. Main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. The case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for Neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133) for Haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for Streptococcus pneumoniae. In a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference between treatment groups. Our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for BM in high-incidence countries.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The characteristics of the contact of proteolytic strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae with enterocytes in vivo].
AB  - The relationships of opportunistic P. mirabilis and K. pneumoniae, both having proteolytic properties, with enteric cells in white mice have been studied on a ligated intestinal loop, used as an experimental model, by electron microscopy. This investigation has shown that the strains under study are capable of damaging the membrane of the jagged edge of enteric cells at the distance of the spread of proteolytic metabolites. This damage is reversible, presenting as compensatory protective reaction of the cells.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [An experimental study of a lactoglobulin preparation against opportunistic bacteria and salmonellae].
AB  - A preclinical study of seven batches of lactoglobulin, a new biological preparation against opportunistic bacteria and salmonellae, has been carried out. High antibacterial activity of the preparation with respect to the virulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis has been established. The preparation has been shown to be safe and nontoxic. The 4-year term of its storage at a temperature of 6 degrees +/- 4 degrees C has been substantiated.
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei and Edwardsiella tarda. Different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. For the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses by E. coli indigenous strains M-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. This observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Chlamydia trachomatis were measured by ELISA in the sera of 99 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased prevalence of IgA and IgG class antibodies against K. pneumoniae and of IgA class against E. coli was observed in ankylosing spondylitis. No clear correlation between the disease activity and occurrence of antibodies was revealed. The results are in line with the previously published findings suggesting that K. pneumoniae may have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.
TI  - Activity of some antiseptics against urinary tract pathogens growing as biofilms  on silicone surfaces.
AB  - The activity of chlorhexidine, mandelic acid and a mandelic/lactic mixture were tested against biofilms of four species of gram-negative nosocomial organisms that commonly infect the catheterized urinary tract. Cells growing on silicone discs were exposed to concentrations of agents used in bladder instillation. Citrobacter diversus biofilms proved to be sensitive to all three agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae all survived well in chlorhexidine but their viability was significantly reduced by the mandelic acid formulations. These results suggest that bladder instillations of mandelic acid or mandelic/lactic acids would be more effective than chlorhexidine in eliminating biofilms from catheter surfaces.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of oral cefixime therapy in common infectious diseases in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. Patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. The diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. Most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. All 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. None of them was microbiologically evaluable. Four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to Salmonella group B, one due to Shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. However, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). Seven Escherichia coli and 4 Proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these two cases had a complicated course. The overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. Although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. In summary, oral cefixime given twice daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  - Amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. Antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. No such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. We have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of such a factor. Amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 X 10(6) and 3 X 10(8) colony forming units/ml. However, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. These results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides and Haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  - The accuracy of examination of the Gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively Gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) Enteric bacteria, (b) Pseudomonas, and (c) Bacteroides or Haemophilus, was evaluated. Randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa, B. fragilis, and H. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. A Gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. The direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. The percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. The assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. To test this hypothesis, we prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. Examination of the Gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, H. influenzae, or B. fragilis. Electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of Ps. aeruginosa. The higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing Ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  - The MIC of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. Some of the more resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. The model simulated, in Mueller-Hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. Bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. The first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. On re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. Drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. These occurred at a high frequency in P. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in K. pneumoniae (10(-3)). P. mirabilis (10(-5)), and E. coli (10(-6)). The number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. The results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: MIC ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Characterization of the Helicobacter pylori urease and purification of its subunits.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (formerly Campylobacter pylori) is the causative agent of gastritis in man. Helicobacter pylori cells contain a large amount of an extremely active urease (E.C.3.5.1.5). This enzyme is suspected to be a virulence factor since the ammonium ion produced from urea may be responsible for tissue injury and/or survival of H. pylori in the gastric environment. Helicobacter pylori urease, native relative molecular mass approximately 600,000, was purified by agarose gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. DEAE-purified urease is highly active and has a Km of 0.48 mM for urea. The enzyme has a pI of 5.93 and is active from pH 4.0 to 10.0, with an optimum at pH 8.0. The purified urease contains nickel and is composed of two protein subunits, with relative molecular masses of 66,000 and 31,000. The subunits were separated and purified and the first 30 N-terminal amino acid residues were determined. A remarkably close relationship was found between both H. pylori urease subunits and jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease, the subunit of which is a single 840 amino acid polypeptide. This subunit is also largely identical to the high molecular mass subunits of the ureases of Klebsiella aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis, evidence that these four ureases are derived from a common ancestral protein.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - Aztreonam for treating meningitis caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - 10 patients with meningitis due to unusual gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas,  Proteus, Salmonella and Klebsiella) were effectively treated with aztreonam. A detailed history and a thorough physical examination combined with careful laboratory testing resulted in accurate diagnosis and cure of all patients.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) versus multiple-dose norfloxacin: results of a multicenter study in females with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - The results of an open, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of Fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril), 3-gram single dose, and Norfloxacin (Noroxine 400), 400 mg twice daily for 5 days, are reported. Clinical and bacteriological assessments were performed before and 3-4 (short-term) and 25-30 days (long-term) after treatment. Only female patients with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection were eligible for inclusion in the study: 33 cases were given Fosfomycin trometamol and 30 cases Norfloxacin. In the overall etiology, Escherichia coli (74% of the strains found), Proteus mirabilis (6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) are highly predominant. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, the percentages of eradication in the two groups were similar: after the short-term test, 93.9% (31 of 33 patients) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 86.6% (26 of 30) in the Norfloxacin group, and after the long-term tests, 73.3% (22 of 30) in the Fosfomycin trometamol group and 77.89% (21 of 27) in the Norfloxacin group. There are no statistically significant differences. The duration of the reported side effects was significantly lower in the Fosfomycin trometamol group. The simplified dosage regimen (single dose) and its favorable benefit/risk ratio justifies the use of Fosfomycin trometamol as a treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in female patients.
TI  - Rhythmic bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics at a large hospital.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility response of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. Four out of the five species (P. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. The species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. Through this analysis it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. The longest period of oscillation was detected for S. aureus (38 months). K. pneumoniae and E. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and P. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). Species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. Although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, bacterial adhesion and polymorphonuclear leucocyte function.
AB  - Culturing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations (1/4 MIC) of trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole or their combination, resulted in reduced adherence of all the above strains. The number of phagocytosed bacteria pre-exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the above antibiotics was not significantly changed, but a significant increase of bactericidal activity of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes was observed. Furthermore, filtrates of K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis grown in the presence of trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulphamethoxazole induced an increased chemotactic response of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
TI  - [Studies on the sub-MIC of beta-lactam antibiotics--bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum].
AB  - Bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum i.e. patients with cancer, the  elderly, diabetes, was stronger than that in normal serum against Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) but was weaker against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Against Escherichia coli (E. coli), bactericidal activity on serum of patients with cancer was weaker in the following order, that in elderly serum, that in diabetic serum. Against Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), bactericidal activity in elderly serum was similar to that in normal serum but was stronger than that in serum of patients with cancer. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), bactericidal activity in elderly serum and diabetic serum was similar to that in normal serum but was weaker than that in serum of patients with cancer. Piperacillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, normal serum and compromised host's serum at a concentration of 1/4 MIC against E. coli, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa. Aspoxicillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, and bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity in normal serum and serum of patients with cancer against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. While cefazolin and cefmetazole slightly inhibited the growth of bacteria in nutrient broth, they showed hardly any bactericidal activity in normal serum and compromised host's serum.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Severe infections treated with intravenous ofloxacin: a prospective clinical multicentre Swiss study.
AB  - In this open prospective clinical trial of iv ofloxacin, 87 patients were treated for severe bacterial infections. Overall results showed a clinical cure rate of 75% and 79/87 87 patients improved. 86% of causative organisms (all sensitive to ofloxacin) were eliminated. The best results were obtained in urinary tract infections where all 30 patients were clinically cured and 27 organisms (Escherichia coli, group D streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were eliminated. Rapid clinical cure was observed in five patients with prostatitis. Good results were seen in arthritis and osteomyelitis. Less than three days of parenteral therapy were required before improvement was seen in patients presenting with severe enterocolitis. Ofloxacin treatment was used for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 35 patients. Clinical improvement was noted in 28 patients. Five patients had unsatisfactory responses, mainly due to underlying diseases. There were two failures, both in pneumococcal pneumonia. Three minor side effects were recorded. Ofloxacin can be given for severe bacterial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negative rods and other sensitive organisms. It can be given in penicillin allergic patients but it should not be used in pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis: observations on its etiology, mortality and sequelae].
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out on all cases diagnosed with neonatal meningitis at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. A rate of 9.6 cases per 1,000 discharged patients was found as well as 6.7% association with sepsis. In 50 of the cases analyzed, an etiologic agent was identified in 23 children; the main bacteria identified were Escherichia coli (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterobacter (4%), Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas sp (2%), respectively. The mortality rate was 60% and sequelae were seen in 13 of the surviving 20 patients. The unfavorable prognosis of neonates with meningitis forces us to establish an early diagnosis, make every effort to identify the causing agent and try new medications as well as co-adjuvant treatments.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Colobronchial fistula: a rare complication of Crohn's colitis.
AB  - A 29-yr-old white woman presented with chronic pneumonia in the left lower lobe and with left pleural effusion. She was known to have inflammatory bowel disease, but she was asymptomatic under maintenance treatment with 5-ASA. She received numerous antibiotic regimens according to susceptibility testing of microorganisms cultured from sputum and bronchial lavage and on an empiric basis was also given antituberculosis treatment, but there was no clinical improvement or change in the chest radiographic findings. Sputum was repeatedly examined and yielded, among other organisms, Clostridium inocuum, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. On one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. A subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. Segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. Histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with Crohn's disease. After a long period of postoperative recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. To our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by Crohn's colitis has not been previously reported.
TI  - [Cooperation between the urologist and microbiologist in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. II. The most common microbial species and their sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs in sepsis at the Urologic Clinic of the Medical School Hospital].
AB  - The authors investigated the spectrum of aetiological agents and their sensitivity to antimicrobial substances in 52 patients with septicaemia at the Urological Clinic in Hradec Kralove during 1984-1987. They found a predominating number of Gram-negative bacteria (82%). The most frequent agent producing sepsis was Klebsiella pneumoniae (19X), its source were in 52% the urinary pathways and 16% the cannula in the subclavian vein. In nine instances the aetiological agent was Escherichia coli and 5 times Proteus mirabilis. The above microorganisms are the most important pathogenic organisms of the urinary pathways. In all cases of bacteriaemia urosepsis was involved. The source of sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7X) was in 43% the urinary tract, in particular in conjunction with instrumental procedures and in 14% a cannula in the subclavian vein. The most effective antimicrobial substance in Gram-negative bacteraemia in the investigated group was amicacin (100%); high sensitivity was recorded also in colistin. In Gram-positive bacteriaemia, where most frequently enterococci were isolated (6X), ampicillin and vancomycin were most effective.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Homology among bacterial catalase genes.
AB  - Catalase activities in crude extracts of exponential and stationary phase cultures of various bacteria were visualized following gel electrophoresis for comparison with the enzymes from Escherichia coli. Citrobacter freundii, Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium exhibited patterns of catalase activity similar to E. coli, including bifunctional HPI-like bands and a monofunctional HPII-like band. Proteus mirabilis, Erwinia carotovora, and Serratia marcescens contained a single band of monofunctional catalase with a mobility intermediate between the HPI-like and HPII-like bands. The cloned genes for catalases HPI (katG) and HPII (katE) from E. coli were used as probes in Southern hybridization analyses for homologous sequences in genomic DNA of the same bacteria. katG was found to hybridize with fragments from C. freudii, Ent. aerogenes, Sal. typhimurium, and K. pneumoniae but not at all with Ed. tarda, P. mirabilis, S. marcesens, or Er. carotovora. katE hybridized with C. freundii and K. pneumoniae DNAs and not with the other bacterial DNAs.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (GM), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (AGs) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of July-December 1989. 1. GM-resistant strains were noted in 24% of Staphylococcus aureus, 12% of Enterobacter spp., 24% of Serratia marcescens, 7% of Morganella morganii and 26% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no GM-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. 2. A majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and a large number of GM-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. GM showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of S. marcescens, M. morganii and P. aeruginosa. 3. Among all the isolates tested of S. marcescens, 24% were GM-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (TOB)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (DKB)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (AMK)-resistant, hence the incidence of GM-resistant strains was the lowest. This tendency was also observed with P. vulgaris. However, among P. aeruginosa, 26% were GM-resistant, 14% TOB-resistant, 18% DKB-resistant and 22% AMK-resistant, thus the incidence rate for GM-resistance was somewhat higher. These results suggest that different AGs-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. Comparing the ratio of GM-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among S. aureus, while decreases were observed among Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in GM-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins).
AB  - A novel direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins) was achieved by treatment of 7 beta (6 beta)-[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1- ylidene)methylimino]cephem (penam) esters with N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)formamide, followed by deblocking with Girard reagent T to give the corresponding 7 alpha (6 alpha)-formamido-7 beta (6 beta)-amino derivatives. Three 7 alpha-formamidocephalosporins were prepared by the conventional N-acylation of 7 alpha-formamidocephem. All of them were resistant to beta-lactamases, showing similar MIC values against both of a pair of a beta-lactamase-producing strain and the corresponding non or low-producing strain of the same species of bacteria, when tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - Purification and characterization of urease from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Urease was purified 112-fold to homogeneity from the microaerophilic human gastric bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. The urease isolation procedure included a water extraction step, size exclusion chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a Km of 0.3 +/- 0.1 mM and a Vmax of 1,100 +/- 200 mumols of urea hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein at 22 degrees C in 31 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The isoelectric point was 5.99 +/- 0.03. Molecular mass estimated for the native enzyme was 380,000 +/- 30,000 daltons, whereas subunit values of 62,000 +/- 2,000 and 30,000 +/- 1,000 were determined. The partial amino-terminal sequence (17 residues) of the large subunit of H. pylori urease (Mr = 62,000) was 76% homologous with an internal sequence of the homohexameric jack bean urease subunit (Mr = 90,770; Takashima, K., Suga, T., and Mamiya, G. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 175, 151-165) and was 65% homologous with amino-terminal sequences of the large subunits of heteropolymeric ureases from Proteus mirabilis (Mr = 73,000) and from Klebsiella aerogenes (Mr = 72,000; Mobley, H. L. T., and Hausinger, R. P. (1989) Microbiol. Rev. 53, 85-108). The amino-terminal sequence (20 residues) of the small subunit of H. pylori urease (Mr = 30,000) was 65 and 60% homologous with the amino-terminal sequences of the subunit of jack bean urease and with the Mr = 11,000 subunit of P. mirabilis urease (Jones, B. D., and Mobley, H. L. T. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 6414-6422), respectively. Thus, the urease of H. pylori shows similarities to ureases found in plants and other bacteria. When used as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, neither purified urease nor an Mr = 54,000 protein that co-purified with urease by size exclusion chromatography was as effective as crude preparations of H. pylori proteins at distinguishing sera from persons known either to be infected with H. pylori or not.
TI  - [The pathogenicity factors of the opportunistic bacteria that cause diarrhea].
AB  
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - 6-(substituted methylene)penems, potent broad spectrum inhibitors of bacterial beta-lactamase. II. Racemic furyl and thienyl derivatives.
AB  - A series of racemic 6-(substituted methylene)penems have been prepared. These compounds contain a 5-membered monoheteroaromatic ring at C-8. The antibacterial/synergistic and beta-lactamase inhibitory activities of both E- and Z-isomers and 2-substituted derivatives are compared.
TI  - Nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan in experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan on experimental bacterial (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus) infections was investigated. Zymosan, being of very low toxicity, significantly enhanced nonspecific resistance to the above bacteria. The enhancement was the most pronounced 2 to 5 days after zymosan treatment.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Correlation between disc potency and zone size in temafloxacin activity in vitro.
AB  - A multi-test disc potency evaluation of a new fluoroquinolone, temafloxacin, has  been prepared in order to evaluate the variation of the zone dimension with the disc antibiotic concentration. A direct correlation between these parameters has been demonstrated. All pathogens have been isolated in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - [Effectiveness and tolerance of cefixime in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis].
AB  - In a prospective, open clinical study, 50 urological patients with acute pyelonephritis were treated with the oral cephalosporin cefixime. The medication (2 x 200 mg/day) was given for seven to ten days. Clinical, bacteriological as well as hematological examinations were carried out prior to, during and immediately after therapy. A late check-up was performed five to nine days after the end of therapy. 46 of the 50 cases were evaluable for efficacy, and all 50 patients were included in safety evaluation. The most frequent pathogens isolated prior to therapy were Escherichia coli (34 times), Proteus mirabilis (six times), Klebsiella pneumoniae (twice) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (twice). Immediately after the end of therapy the pathogens were eradicated in 44 (97.5%) patients. At the late check-up the urine was sterile in 29 (63%) patients. A relapse was observed in 11 patients, a reinfection in four and the initially isolated pathogens had persisted in two. Immediately after the end of therapy 44 (95.7%) patients were clinically cured and two patients had improved. At the late check-up 41 patients were classified as clinically cured, three showed improvement, and two improvement with relapse. Adverse reactions (one case nausea and exanthem, and one case of meteorism) occurred in two patients. No changes in the blood counts or in the liver and kidney functions were observed. In the study described here cefixime proved to be an effective and well tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of upper urinary tract infections; it is of particular interest that 16 of the 50 patients presented with underlying disease favoring infection.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - [Antibacterial action of some saturated and unsaturated long-chain carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters in vitro].
AB  - Using the method of twofold serial dilution of substances in liquid nutrient medium with subsequent reseeding on solid nutrient medium a comparative study has been carried out of the antibacterial action in vitro of long chain saturated (C10-C18) and unsaturated (C11-C22) carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus 101+ and Proteus mirabilis 56. The compounds studied have an inhibitory effect upon the development of the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranges from 1.8 to 19.3 mumol/ml. There exists a linear correlation between the length of the carbon chain (the number of C atoms) of the compounds and the minimum inhibitory concentration in the following cases: esters of saturated acids (C16-C24) and unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph; esters of unsaturated acids (C17-C28) against Staphylococcus aureus 101+. This correlation has not been found in all other compounds against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Proteus mirabilis 56.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of KT3777, a new orally active carbacephem.
AB  - KT3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (CCL), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. KT3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with CCL, cephalexin (CEX) and amoxicillin. The MIC50 of KT3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. KT3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of CCL. However, against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, KT3777 was about twice as active as CCL. KT3777 was more active than CEX against all strains tested. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of KT3777 at concentrations above the MIC. KT3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1A, 1Bs, 3 and 4 of E. coli NIHJ JC-2. The protective effect of KT3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of CCL with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of CEX. KT3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR-830H), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. Piperacillin MICs were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2 or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. The higher concentration was generally more effective. Tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. Although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. MICs were reduced to the susceptible range for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against Morganella spp. Some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. The inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. Combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. In particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 enzymes. In vitro activity was reflected in vivo. Tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the Morganella infection. Tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.
TI  - Outpatient antimicrobial susceptibility: comparison with inpatient susceptibility patterns.
AB  - Because specific outpatient epidemiologic data on the susceptibility of organisms are not readily available to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the ambulatory setting, we reviewed all positive culture reports of clinical specimens (n = 935) isolated exclusively from outpatients of the Eastern Carolina Family Practice Center over a 1-year period. Eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. An antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported elsewhere. More than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species. Susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. Further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. Whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Hygienic status of food handlers.
AB  - The study demonstrated bacterial species on hands and nails of food-handlers before and after hand-washing. Those were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Diphtheroid, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Citrobacter freundii. Before hand washing, each food-handler harboured one to eight bacterial species. After hand-washing (eight with water from plastic boxes, 97 from pipe water, 57 out of 97 (58.8%) used soap or detergent with water), disappearance of one to four bacterial strains from hands and nails were found in 47.6 per cent of food-handlers. Cultures of water used for washing from eight plastic boxes yielded Staph. spp., Strep. spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Kleb.pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae. From pipe water, Diphtheroid in 4, 4.1 per cent Micrococcus in 1, 1.03 per cent were shown. Comparing bacterial species found in food-handlers with long nails and short nails, 4-8 more species were revealed in the former than the latter for 35.7 per cent. After hand-washing, there was recontamination of bacterial species in 17 food-handlers. This was probably due to dirty napkins or dresses during hand-drying or from water in plastic boxes.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - In bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (CPDX-PR, CS-807), the following results were obtained: 1. Antibacteriological activity Antibacteriological activity of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, cefroxadine (CXD), cefazolin (CEZ), cephalothin (CET) and amoxicillin (AMPC) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: Staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), Escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Antibacterial activities of CXD and CET, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. R-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except S. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than AMPC. Most frequent MIC values of R-3746 to S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. Against isolated strains of MRSA, MICs of R-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to MIC values of CCL and AMPC against these organisms. MIC values of R-3746 against CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were superior to MICs of other antibiotics, and the MIC50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. Against many isolated strains of E. cloacae MIC values of R-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC50 of R-3746 against E. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. Absorption and excretion Serum concentration and urinary excretion of CPDX (the active form of CPDX-PR) were studied upon single oral administration of CPDX-PR at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). The peak of serum concentration of CPDX was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of CPDX for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. As the average AUC's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates of CPDX for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
TI  - T-mod pathway, a reduced sequence for identification of gram-negative urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - In this paper, we describe a reduced sequence of identification that includes T-mod medium, a selective and differential isolation medium which allows accurate presumptive identification of the most common gram-negative bacteria encountered in urine samples. The present study, performed on bacteria isolated from 1,762 independent urine samples, has shown that a few selected tests (lysine and ornithine decarboxylase, urease and trehalose fermentation tests) improve the identification accuracy of T-mod, making it possible both to identify the less frequent species and to prevent some misidentifications of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The proposed work flow agreed with conventional identification protocols to a 99.3% extent and allowed identification of 87.4% of the isolates directly from the primary plate, 11.4% after 1 to 3 additional tests, and 1.2% after an identification gallery.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. In the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. The more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml) of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). Cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. Due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). As a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin, was evaluated against various strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined on three consecutive days with an inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or a culture in the logarithmic growth phase. The results found tigemonam to be rapidly bactericidal against most Enterobacteriaceae isolated. In addition, the killing curves indicated a synergism between tigemonam and subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - Postpartum bacteriuria. A multicenter evaluation of different screening procedures and a controlled short-course treatment trial with amoxycillin.
AB  - A total of 10,909 puerperal women from 6 different hospitals were screened for bacteriuria by culture of voided midstream urine (MSU), and a significant growth was found in 881 patients (8.1%). In 731 cases the urine was reexamined by using suprapubic aspiration (SPA), and in only 354 (48%) of the samples the diagnosis of bacteriuria was confirmed. The contamination rate of the MSU samples varied from 46 to 69% between the different hospitals, indicating that in the postpartum period positive MSU findings would necessitate more thorough examination in order to confirm the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. In our study, suprapubic aspiration was found to be a simple and acceptable method without any side effects. Confirmed bacteriuria occurred in 3.2% of the women. Operative delivery (Cesarean section, forceps and vacuum extractor delivery), epidural anesthesia and bladder catheterization increased the risk of bacteriuria in the postpartum period. Only 27% of the women with positive bladder urine complained of dysuria and this symptom was significantly more common in women who had been catheterized. 230 patients with confirmed bacteriuria with amoxycillin-sensitive bacterias participated in a randomized short-course treatment trial: 114 women received 3 days treatment with amoxycillin (1.5 g/day), 116 received the traditional 10 days therapy (750 mg amoxycillin/day). Both antibiotic regimens were observed to be effective with a cure rate of 96 and 98%, respectively. Short-course antibiotic treatment should thus be recommended to puerperal women with urinary tract infections since this avoids prolonged drug exposure to the lactating mother.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  - We have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). Two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. In most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. Only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. Seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. The isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: E. coli (9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). There were only two gram positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The overall clinical response rate was 91%. Gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. Colonization by Candida or Enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. Four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. Ciprofloxacin appears as an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including severe enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - Effects of microamperage, medium, and bacterial concentration on iontophoretic killing of bacteria in fluid.
AB  - Prevention of nosocomial urinary tract infections by iontophoresis is addressed.  An iontophoretic generator was used to provide microamperage (10 to 400 microA) to vials containing either synthetic urine or supplemented synthetic urine. Bacteria were added to vials, and parameters of growth, bacterial killing, and multiple electrode materials were examined. Escherichia coli and Proteus species were both inhibited and killed at various microamperages and with several electrode types, the most efficient being gold-gold as the anode-cathode combination. Klebsiella pneumoniae in supplemented synthetic urine was least inhibited in growth, and higher microamperage (200 to 400 microA) was most effective in killing the bacteria. Bacterial growth reduction and killing were directly related to increasing microamperage and were inversely related to bacterial concentration.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in primary care: predominant microbes and their antibiotic sensitivity].
AB  - We have prospectively evaluated 227 episodes of community-acquired urinary tract  infection (UTI) from October 1st to December, 15th, 1987. The urine samples, adequately collected, were processed in the Bacteriology Laboratory of the Albacete General Hospital. E. coli was the most commonly isolated organism (62%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.6%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.6%), Serratia marcescens (6.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.2%). As regards the sensitivity of E. coli to the most commonly used antibiotics, there was a 56% resistance to ampicillin, 37% to cotrimoxazole, 40% to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, and 46% to cephalothin. These are in contrast with the small number of resistance, at least in vitro, to urinary chemotherapeuticals and phosphomycin. We emphasize the importance of the knowledge of the organisms more commonly involved in UTI and their updated sensitivity to antimicrobials for the best management of these infections.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Purification of cross-reacting protein antigen shared by Yersinia enterocolitica  and other gram-negative bacteria with monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the Yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (CRPA), was obtained by cell fusion. The CRPA common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from Y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (IgG1) thus obtained. The purified CRPA showed a single band of 60 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reacted with rabbit antisera against Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei in Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kDa peptide from Y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such as V. cholerae, E. coli, S. sonnei, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. The results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on a CRPA molecule.
TI  - Blockage of urinary catheters: role of microorganisms and constituents of the urine on formation of encrustations.
AB  - Long-term indwelling urinary catheters may become blocked in some patients by formation of encrustations made up of aggregated struvite crystals while other patients rarely develop blocked catheters. We have designated these groups as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers". To further understand this phenomenon we followed 32 catheterized elderly women in a nursing home. Catheters were changed six times at 2 week intervals. Patients tended to remain as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers" consistently over time. There were no significant differences in use of antibiotics, clinical manifestations of urinary infection or fever among the groups. "Blockers" were significantly more often colonized with Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii than "non-blockers", and significantly less often with Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, there was no evidence of interference among the organisms. "Blockers" excreted a significantly more alkaline urine, and lesser amounts of magnesium, urea and phosphate in their urine. Two "blockers" in whom Proteus sp. were eliminated by coincidental antimicrobial therapy converted to "non-blockers". These findings support the concept that "blockers" are patients who have prolonged colonization with urease producing Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Potencies of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in a single chamber pharmacokinetic system simulating their in vivo half-lives.
AB  - Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are third-generation cephalosporins with similar in vitro potencies and spectra. However, previous studies have shown that ceftriaxone had superior in vivo activity (mouse PD50 values greater than or equal to 2-fold lower) compared to cefotaxime in 23 of 46 tested enterobacteriaceae. This superior activity was thought to be due to ceftriaxone's 5- to 8-fold longer half-life. The relationship between half-life (ceftriax-one 6 h, cefotaxime 1 h) and potency was examined by following bacterial kill curves in a single chamber, open-ended perfusion model over an 8-hour period. Both antibiotics were compared for efficacy at both half-lives against four gram-negative bacteria. For two of the bacterial strains antibiotic potency differences in the perfusion model were determined largely by pharmacokinetics. For the other two strains intrinsic bacterial and antibiotic properties were of prime importance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - High resolution deuterium NMR studies of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - High resolution deuterium NMR spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Deuterium-labeled D-glucose at C-1, C-2, and C-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. The flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance of the major end products in the 2H NMR spectrum. The presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1H NMR spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. The 1H-1H scalar coupling observed in both the 2H and 1H NMR spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. An increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. The steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2H NMR spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Studies of metabolites in diarrheal stool specimens positive for Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. by frequency-pulsed electron-capture gas chromatography.
AB  - Diarrheal stools from infants from which Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, and Proteus mirabilis were isolated as possible causative agents of diarrhea were studied. These stools, along with control stool specimens which were collected from infants in the same village of Tamooh (near Cairo, Egypt), were analyzed by frequency-pulsed electron-capture gas chromatography (FPEC-GC). Watery stools and formed stools, to which distilled water was added, were centrifuged, and the supernatant was extracted with organic solvents and derivatized with specific functional group reagents to form electron-absorbing derivatives of carboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, alcohols, and amines. Results from the study showed distinct differences in FPEC-GC profiles of stools positive for K. pneumoniae, S. liquefaciens, and P. mirabilis. The major differences found were that diarrheal stools from which K. pneumoniae was isolated contained acetoin, a hydroxy acid-labeled peak F, and an unidentified amine, peak A. S. liquefaciens diarrheal stools had FPEC-GC profiles like the controls with the exception that an amine, peak A, was detected. The diarrhel stools containing P. mirabilis produced a distinct amine profile.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the University Hospital in 1987 to six beta-Lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. Results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. Most of the strains belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. They were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Most strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. More than half of the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in Pseudomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against clinical isolates in pediatrics].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of gentamicin (GM), along with activities of other aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, was studied against clinical isolates collected from pediatric patients during a period of May 1986-April 1987. 1. GM-resistance was noted in 22% of Staphylococcus aureus, 6% of Proteus vulgaris, 8% of Morganella morganii, 40% of Providencia spp., 6% of Enterobacter spp., 14% of Serratia marcescens, and 14% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. No GM-resistance was observed with isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. 2. The antibacterial activity of GM against clinical isolates from pediatric patients was found to be comparable to its activity against clinical isolates from adults studied at the same time. 3. The majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were MCRSA, and the GM-resistant strains of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found also to be resistant to multiple drugs. 4. GM-resistant strains were found at relatively high rates (14-22%) in S. aureus, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. These rates did not increase compared to the rates observed in the first half of the 1980's. 5. GM was considered to have poor antibacterial activity against genus Providencia. It is concluded from above results that GM still maintains effective antibacterial activity against many of causative organisms of infections in both adults and children.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of cefotetan-aminoside combinations].
AB  - Bactericidal activity of cefotetan-gentamicin combinations was studied on 6 bacterial strains: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. vulgaris, P. stuarti. Time kille curves technic was performed with final concentrations of cefotetan: 4 at 32 mg/l, and of gentamicin: 0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; 8 mg/l and with an 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum. Cefotetan at 4 mg/l was not able to obtain a 0.01% (percentage of survivors) bactericidal activity before 24 h. The combination cefotetan-gentamicin (0.25 to 2 mg/l according to the strains) were bactericidal (0.01% of survivors) before 24 h: 1 to 6 h according to the strains, more rapidly than with gentamicin alone at the same concentration. This more rapid bactericidal activity obtained by cefotetan-gentamicin combination seems to indicate this combination in the treatment of severe infections in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - New plate medium for screening and presumptive identification of gram-negative urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - A new selective, differential plating medium to screen the common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens is described. The medium combines adonitol fermentation, phenylalanine deaminase, and beta-glucuronidase tests and allows the indole and cytochrome oxidase tests to be performed directly from the plates. High-level agreement with individual conventional tests was recorded in comparative studies with 504 cultures of gram-negative rods. There was 100% agreement, except for the Providencia spp. indole spot test (61.6% agreement). Adonitol fermentation by Providencia species could not be determined. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified with a high efficiency (100, 85.7, 83.5, and 100% agreement, respectively) without further testing. There was 96% overall agreement for the 267 infected urine samples tested.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol.
AB  - The therapeutic effectiveness of a single oral dose (60 and 200 mg/kg body weight) of fosfomycin trometamol (FT), norfloxacin, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) and pipemidic acid against experimental cystitis in the rat were compared. Infections were produced with clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in a total of 135 Sprague-Dawley albino rats. Oral treatment with all four drugs consistently lowered the numbers of CFU in bladder tissue, especially E. coli and P. mirabilis. Fosfomycin trometamol appeared to be as effective as norfloxacin for treatment of E. coli cystitis even thoughs its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in vitro is 100 times greater than that of the quinolonic antibiotic. Fosfomycin trometamol, pipemidic acid and Bactrim were equally effective against P. mirabilis infection, but FT was less active than norfloxacin or Bactrim for treatment of K. pneumonia cystitis. In conclusion, single dose treatment with fosfomycin trometamol was effective for treatment of experimental cystitis in the rat and might, by extrapolation, be of use in clinical practice for single dose treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in human urine of fosfomycin trometamol in an in vitro model of the urinary bladder.
AB  - The urinary concentrations of fosfomycin trometamol, norfloxacin, pipemidic acid  and cotrimoxazole were studied at various times after oral administration of drugs in healthy volunteers. Using the same urine, the bactericidal activity of four antimicrobial agents against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in an in vitro model simulating the treatment of bacterial cystitis was also evaluated. The results obtained show that very high concentrations of the drugs were achieved in urine particularly after the oral administration of the fosfomycin trometamol. In the bladder model bactericidal activity of fosfomycin trometamol, norfloxacin and pipemidic acid were higher than that of cotrimoxazole; no resistant mutants to drugs were selected over a period of 24 h.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli to cefotaxime, over a period of 3 years.
AB  
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing of broad-spectrum antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. Ten isolates each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. The isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. The most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and 61%, respectively. The highest synergistic activity was against Enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the S. aureus isolates. A relatively low synergistic activity was noted against P. aeruginosa. No case of antagonism was observed. Subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to MIC concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. Netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - A regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  - From 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the Netherlands. Each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. The susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml in ISO-Sensitest broth (Oxoid). No significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. There was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. In contrast, there was a general tendency to an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.
TI  - Variable in vitro activity of cefaclor, cephalothin and cefadroxil against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefaclor, cephalothin and cefadroxil to 50 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 20 Proteus mirabilis strains was tested with the disc diffusion and microdilution plate techniques. Cefaclor was more active than cefadroxil, while cephalothin was intermediate. The differences seriously affected the classification into the routine SIR system. For susceptibility testing we question the use of cephalothin as a class representative of oral cephalosporins.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (SISO) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (AGs) (gentamicin (GM), tobramycin (TOB), dibekacin (DKB), amikacin (AMK] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in Japan. 1. The incidence of SISO-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence of SISO resistant strains remains on the stable level. The incidence of SISO-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2. SISO-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant indole(+) Proteus varied depending on strains. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant P. vulgaris and Morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of Providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. Refering to an American study reporting that the Genus Providencia including P. rettgeri showed high incidence of resistance to SISO as well as to GM or TOB, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of AGs against Genus Providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) Proteus strains. 4. No SISO-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or P. mirabilis were found. 5. SISO had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and SISO may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful AGs.
TI  - Assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  - A simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. The activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with EDTA + Tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. Comparison with other new cephems].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of CPZ, Cefotiam (CTM), Cefotaxime (CTX) and Latamoxef (LMOX). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of SBT and CPZ mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by the dilution method using Mueller-Hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of CPZ. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/CPZ against principally penicillinase (PCase) producing bacteria, i.e., S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, were superior to those of CPZ alone. The presence of SBT in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced CPZ's antimicrobial activities against these PCase producing strains. The synergistic antimicrobial effects of SBT in combination with CPZ were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (CEPase) producing bacteria, i.e., C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa, and exerted with SBT at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. Comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by MIC80's of tested agents showed that SBT/CPZ had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria than CTM, CTX and LMOX. MIC's of SBT/CPZ were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of S. aureus, 18% of C. freundii, 10% of Enterobacter spp., 26% of S. marcescens, 2% of P. vulgaris, and 18% of P. aeruginosa. These resistant strains against which the addition of SBT showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. It is concluded that the presence of CPZ resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from CPZ is increasing. When these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of SBT/CPZ in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates in a hospital  with long-term use of gentamicin.
AB  - Between 1977 and 1985, gentamicin was the only formulary aminoglycoside at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Medical Center. During this time, there was a significant increase in the amount of gentamicin purchased. Amikacin represented 11% or less of the total aminoglycoside purchased in the same period, but purchases of this agent also significantly increased. Because of this long-term use of gentamicin, a retrospective analysis of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates was performed. The results of this review revealed no significant change in the overall incidence of gram-negative bacteremia; approximately 75% of these bacteremic episodes were hospital acquired. The mean yearly gentamicin-resistance rate of gram-negative blood isolates was 13.2% (range, 6% to 18%) with no significant change in the rate for the period reviewed. However, for certain strains there were fluctuations in the percentage of resistance from year to year, suggesting that clusters of infections due to these organisms had occurred. Bacteremic infection due to resistant organisms was a major contributor to the overall level of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates. Amikacin resistance among gram-negative blood isolates was rare. In conclusion, despite the predominant use of gentamicin there was no change in the gentamicin resistance rate among gram-negative bacillary blood isolates during a nine-year period. The rate of gentamicin resistance among blood isolates appeared to be related to outbreaks/clusters of infections due to resistant strains rather than the frequency of use of gentamicin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - A new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. BMY-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. BMY-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more active than cephalexin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to BMY-28100 and cefaclor. The bactericidal activity of BMY-28100 against S. aureus, E. coli and P. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as MIC value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. The stability of BMY-28100 against penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. BMY-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three Gram-positive bacterial infections. BMY-28100 was also more potent against infections of H. influenzae and P. mirabilis, but slightly less active against E. coli Juhl than cefaclor. Blood level parameters of BMY-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. The urinary recovery of BMY-28100 was somewhat higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees C.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the nickel-containing multicomponent urease  from Klebsiella aerogenes.
AB  - Klebsiella aerogenes urease was purified 1,070-fold with a 25% yield by a simple  procedure involving DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superose 6 chromatographies. The enzyme preparation was comprised of three polypeptides with estimated Mr = 72,000, 11,000, and 9,000 in a alpha 2 beta 4 gamma 4 quaternary structure. The three components remained associated during native gel electrophoresis, Mono Q chromatography, and Superose 6 chromatography despite the presence of thiols, glycols, detergents, and varied buffer conditions. The apparent compositional complexity of K. aerogenes urease contrasts with the simple well-characterized homohexameric structure for jack bean urease (Dixon, N. E., Hinds, J. A., Fihelly, A. K., Gazzola, C., Winzor, D. J., Blakeley, R. L., and Zerner, B. (1980) Can. J. Biochem. 58, 1323-1334); however, heteromeric subunit compositions were also observed for the enzymes from Proteus mirabilis, Sporosarcina ureae, and Selemonomas ruminantium. K. aerogenes urease exhibited a Km for urea of 2.8 +/- 0.6 mM and a Vmax of 2,800 +/- 200 mumol of urea min-1 mg-1 at 37 degrees C in 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazineN'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 5.0 mM EDTA buffer, pH 7.75. The enzyme activity was stable in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, and over a pH range from 5 to 10.5, with maximum activity observed at pH 7.75. Two active site groups were defined by their pKa values of 6.55 and 8.85. The amino acid composition of K. aerogenes urease more closely resembled that for the enzyme from Brevibacter ammoniagenes (Nakano, H., Takenishi, S., and Watanabe, Y. (1984) Agric. Biol. Chem. 48, 1495-1502) than those for plant ureases. Atomic absorption analysis was used to establish the presence of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mol of nickel per mol of 72,000-dalton subunit in K. aerogenes urease.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - [Study of the sensitivity to pipemidic acid, pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacterial strains isolated at a general hospital].
AB  - After one year of use of pefloxacin in the intensive care unit, medicine unit and surgery unit and the following recent commercialization without prescription of norfloxacin, we studied for a period of two months (april and may 1986) the susceptibility to pipemidic acid, to pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacteria strains isolated obtained from clinical specimens. The antibiotic susceptibility is determined by disk diffusion test. We obtained the following results: susceptible methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (SMSA 63 strains): 85.7% PEFS, 11.1% PEFI, 79.4% NORS, 15.9% NORI, resistant methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (RMSA 36 strains): 33.3% PEFS, 2.9% PEFI, 41.6% NORS, 0% NORI; Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (252 strains): 94% PIPS, 94.8% PEFS, 97.2% NORS; Enterobacter, Proteus indol (+), Providencia and Citrobacter (33 strains): 72.7% PIPS, 72.7% PEFS, 84.8% NORS; Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53 strains): 32% PEFS, 47.2% PEFI, 90.6% NORS, 5.6% NORI; Acinetobacter (7 strains): 57.2% PEFS, 42.8% PEFI, 42.8% NORS, 28.6% NORI. Norfloxacin in active in vitro against the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolated. We found an important methicillin and pefloxacin resistance among the Staphylococcus aureus isolated: 36 strains RMSA (36.4% out of Staphylococcus aureus) and 23 strains RMSA PEFR (63.8% out of RMSA). These later strains were isolated in eight different units mainly in visceral surgery unit and geriatric units but not in intensive care unit. After an epidemiologic study and the following recommendations to physicians and nurses: treatment by pefloxacin should be used only after bacteriological results and associated with an other antibiotic, the handwashing should be frequent and regular to prevent the spread of infection, four months later we isolated 26 strains of RMSA with 7 RMSA PEF (26.9%).2$
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  - The efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. The aerobic gram-negative bacilli were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Serratia marcescens (five isolates), Escherichia coli (three isolates), Enterobacter species (three isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. Nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. Peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the MBCs in 20 of 24 patients. Twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. A sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks of therapy with a newly resistant S. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive P. aeruginosa strain. Toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). Two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. Overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzoname in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzoname (CZON) one of the aminothiazolyloxyiminoacetamido cephalosporins, was  studied for its antibacterial activity, absorption and excretion, concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the penetration, and clinical efficacy. The following are a summary of the results: 1. Antibacterial activity; The antibacterial activity of CZON was studied on clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus (cefazolin (CEZ)-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis. Compared with CZON were cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone, cefmetazol (CMZ), cefotiam and CEZ, but for S. aureus cefamandole (CMD) was replaced for CPZ. Activities of CZON against S. aureus, both CEZ-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains, were superior to those of 6 control drugs. The distribution of MICs for the CEZ-susceptible strains was 0.10-12.5 micrograms/ml, and for the CEZ-tolerant strains 0.20-greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC peaks were 0.39 micrograms/ml and 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml for CEZ-susceptible and CEZ-tolerant strains, respectively. Against both susceptible and tolerant strains, CZON showed superiority to CMZ and CMD, which are used prevalently and used for Methicillin-resistant S. aureus also. Distributions of MICs of CZON (and the peak of MICs) on E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were less than or equal to 0.025-1.56 (less than or equal to 0.025), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025-0.05), less than or equal to 0.025-25 (less than or equal to 0.025) micrograms/ml, respectively, showing CZON's similar antibacterial activity to those of cephalosporins, CMX and LMOX, which are 5th group. 2. Absorption and excretion: Eight patients, aged 10 months to 15 years, were administered with CZON 20 mg/kg, one shot intravenously. Serum concentrations somewhat varied from patient to patient, but the mean value was 48.7 micrograms/ml after 30 minutes of administration which decreased rapidly to 13.3 micrograms/ml after 1 hour, to 3.4 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, to 1.14 micrograms/ml after 4 hours, and to 0.15 microgram/ml after 6 hours. Half-lives were 0.67-1.47 hours, with the mean of 0.87 hour. Urinary recovery rates were 24.7-55.9%, with the mean of 45.1%, in 6 hours after administration. 3. CSF concentration and penetration rate: To 4 pediatric patients with purulent meningitis, CZON 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg was administered and the concentration in CSF was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Studies were carried out on the penetration of cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, into cerebrospinal fluid, and on the clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. The results are summarized as follows: Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in cases of furunculosis of the external canal, encephalitis and mumps meningitis were 0.56 micrograms/ml, 1.44 micrograms/ml and 0.33 micrograms/ml, respectively. Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in 3 cases of purulent meningitis were 2.80-6.40 micrograms/ml at the acute stage and 0.56-1.45 micrograms/ml even at the recovering stage. Sensitivities of clinically isolated strains to CZON were determined and expressed as MIC. MICs of CZON on Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae were similar to MIC's of cefmenoxime (CMX), and lower than those of cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefatiam (CTM) and Cefazolin (CEZ). The MIC of CZON on Staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of CEZ, CMZ and CTM, and lower than those of CMX and CPZ. Clinical responses of CZON were good in 2 cases of purulent meningitis, good in 2 cases of pyothorax, excellent in 1 case of septicemia, excellent in 3 cases of urinary tract infections, excellent in 7 cases and good in 3 cases out of 10 cases of pneumonia. Clinical responses of other diseases were excellent in 4 cases of bronchitis, good in 1 case of furunculosis of the external canal, excellent in 1 case of tonsillitis. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 2 cases of mild diarrhea out of 24 cases.
TI  - In-vitro anti-microbial susceptibility of clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria to ten antibiotics including phosphomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ten antibiotics was determined for  various bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in a Lagos hospital. The in-vitro activity of penicillin and tetracycline was not very impressive and a similarity was noticed in the resistance patterns of these two antibiotics, while the activity in vitro of the relatively more toxic aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol was high for Gram-negative rods. Ceftazidime demonstrated the highest activity in vitro against all pathogens studied. Cefoxitin, cefuroxime and phosphomycin demonstrated an impressive activity in vitro. Clindamycin was very active against strains of Staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase production amongst these strains was studied and the clinical significance of this and their MIC results are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Treatment of urinary tract infections with SolcoUrovac].
AB  - Urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. If  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. Immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens offers a possibility of managing these infections. In clinical trials we tested SolcoUrovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. A urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. Two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. The rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. After one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.
TI  - N-nitrosamine formation in urinary-tract infections.
AB  - Urine samples from 31 patients with urinary-tract infections and from 31 controls were analysed for volatile nitrosamines, N-nitrosamino acids, total N-nitroso compounds as a group, and nitrite/nitrate. The concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine was significantly elevated in urines infected with Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The levels of nitrite, N-nitrosoproline and total N-nitroso compounds, when expressed as the amount per mol creatinine, were also significantly increased in patients with bacteriuria. Several bacterial strains were capable of catalysing nitrosation of morpholine at neutral pH. These results suggest that N-nitroso compounds can be formed in vivo in the infected bladder, which could explain the association between urinary-tract infections and increased risk for bladder cancer.
TI  - A comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. Human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. In contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
TI  - Worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in Japan, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, and Hungary. Standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. Susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. Minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. The susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for Escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for Enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin for pediatric infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - One hundred and four children who were hospitalized for documented or suspected non-CNS bacterial infections (56 males/48 females, 22 days to 15 years old) were treated with intravenous imipenem/cilastatin for 9.4 days (range 3 to 28 days). Children up to three years of age received 100 mg/kg/day and older children 60 mg/kg/day, administered in four divided doses. Bacterial pathogens were isolated before therapy in 85%. Diagnoses in the 74 evaluable patients included bronchopneumonia with or without empyema (20%), peritonitis complicating appendicitis (16%), skin/soft tissue abscesses (14%), septicemia (11%) and miscellaneous other infections (39%). Among evaluable patients, 95% were clinically cured or improved. One patients, a marasmic child with pneumonitis due to pseudomonas, died during therapy. One evaluable patient each with shigellosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae empyema and streptococcal pneumonia had bacteriologic eradication or suppression but, due partly to noninfectious complications, had no overall clinical improvement. Most bacterial isolates (101/108) were eradicated, including many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes; three pathogens persisted (one Proteus mirabilis and one Salmonella typhi, one Staphylococcus aureus); and one Escherichia coli pyelonephritis recurred after therapy ended too early. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated by 91% of children. Clinical adverse experiences (AEs), none serious except for the one death, occurred in 19%; 12% were judged possibly related to imipenem/cilastatin, but none probably or definitely related. No serious laboratory AEs occurred; the most common AEs were eosinophilia (11%), urine discoloration, and infusion site pain. Imipenem/cilastatin is well tolerated and has excellent clinical efficacy in a wide variety of pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ro 23-6240 was assessed and compared with  those of ciprofloxacin and beta-lactam antibiotics including several oral compounds against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (n = 130) and Pseudomonas spp. (n = 31). In general, Ro 23-6240 was 2 dilution steps less active than ciprofloxacin. For the Pseudomonas spp. the MICs for 90% inhibition were 2 and 0.5 mg/1 for Ro 23-6240 and ciprofloxacin, respectively. For the other species tested, the MIC90 values for Ro 23-6240 ranged from 0.031 to 1 mg/1 and for ciprofloxacin from 0.016 to 0.25 mg/1. Spontaneous Ro 23-6240-resistant mutants were only isolated from Enterobacter cloacae with a frequency similar to that of ciprofloxacin (4.8 X 10(-8) and 2.4 X 10(-8), respectively). No resistant mutants were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 4 and 8 times the MIC of Ro 23-6240 or ciprofloxacin (frequency less than 10(-9).
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics at medical centres in different parts of the world.
AB  - The diameters of the zones of inhibition of consecutive clinical isolates around  antibiotic susceptibility test discs at medical centres in different parts of the world were computer filed and analysed by a series of programs that evaluate test quality and compare results. Percentages of isolates resistant to ampicillin at 18 centres ranged from 16 to 73 for Escherichia coli and from 3 to 56 for Proteus mirabilis. Percentages resistant to chloramphenicol ranged from 2 to 48 for E. coli, from 5 to 52 for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and from 8 to 67 for Serratia marcescens. Gentamicin resistance did not exceed 4% at any of 18 centres and was less than 1 at 14 of them for isolates of E. coli, while K. pneumoniae showed less than 2% resistance at six centres but averaged 22% at another eight. Multi-resistant isolates were ten-fold more frequent at eight centres than at the remaining six. Too few centres were sampled to characterize individual countries except in the United States where resistance seemed generally less prevalent.
TI  - Use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. Duration of therapy was 2-8 days. Bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: Escherichia coli (60%); Proteus mirabilis (10%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp. (7%); Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas species (3%). At completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. No significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. It is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  - Bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in U.S. medical care facilities. This bacteriuria is polymicrobial and dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. We compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. The commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) CFU/ml of urine specimen. Organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. However, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like Providencia stuartii and Morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. More complete reporting may lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. This, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of severe urinary tract infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Aztreonam was administered to 30 patients, ages 0.03 to 15.4 years, with severe and in 21 cases complicated urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to the study drug in vitro. A mean dose of 47.7 mg/kg was given intramuscularly every 12 h to 26 patients. In four patients with renal insufficiency, the dose was reduced according to pharmacokinetic data. Permanent urine sterilization and clinical cure were achieved in 22 patients, 13 of whom had urological malformations. In two patients with P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis infections, the treatment failed. Another patient had an Escherichia coli reinfection 21 days after the end of therapy. Four patients with various urological abnormalities had gram-positive superinfections, and two patients had gram-negative superinfections during and at the end of therapy: all six had indwelling ureteric splints or pyelostomy as predisposing conditions. No adverse clinical effects were observed. Some transient and slight or moderate alterations were observed at the end of treatment: eosinophilia (nine cases), elevation of hepatic enzymes (eight cases), prolongation of prothrombin time (three cases), and neutropenia (one case). A pharmacokinetic study was performed in six patients with normal renal function and in seven patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. The elimination half-life of the drug was inversely correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. At the dosage used, aztreonam proved effective for severe urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to bladder uroepithelial cells in catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - To assess the role of bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the pathogenesis of nosocomial urinary tract infection, we prospectively studied 55 patients with indwelling urinary catheters. We obtained uroepithelial cells from the bladder and urine for culture on the patients' entry into the study and every two to four days during catheterization. In all, 235 collections of uroepithelial cells from these patients were used in an in vitro adherence assay with six gram-negative bacterial strains. With uroepithelial cells from patients who did not have bacterial infections, the adherence of the bacteria used in the assay differed significantly according to species. The least adherence occurred with Escherichia coli GR12; the adherence increased with (in order) Proteus mirabilis, E. coli J96, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With cells collected just before the onset of bacteriuria, adherence of these gram-negative strains was higher in patients in whom gram-negative rod infections developed than in those with gram-positive coccal infections (P = 0.005). Analysis with the Cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that a significant increase in bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the bladder occurred two to four days before the onset of bacteriuria, but that adherence returned to base-line values with the onset of bacteriuria. These results suggest that a transient increase in the adherence of gram-negative bacteria to bladder epithelial cells may be an important early event in the development of catheter-associated bacteriuria.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for Streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. CI-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to CI-934. CI-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii. The medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of CI-934. Magnesium at a concentration of 9 mM increased MICs and MBCs four- to eightfold, and testing at pH 6 increased MICs as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with MICs at pH 7. The frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.
TI  - Characterization of pathogenic bacteria by automated headspace concentration-gas  chromatography.
AB  - Automated headspace concentration-gas chromatography (AHC-GC) was used to profile the volatile metabolites produced by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial cultures were incubated in trypticase soy broth and examined at 24 h. The profiles were consistent for each genus examined and variation observed among the different strains of each species was chiefly quantitative. The volatiles were identified by concurrent headspace concentration-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and consisted mainly of isobutanol, isopentanol, isopentyl acetate, 1-undecene and methyl ketones. There were sufficient differences in the profiles in the 4-6 min elution period to distinguish P. aeruginosa and S. aureus from each other and from the other two bacteria. P. mirabilis and K. pneumoniae typically showed three intense peaks which corresponded to isobutanol, isopentyl acetate and isopentanol. The determination of volatiles by AHC-GC is sensitive, rapid and offers a possible alternative for automatic detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - The efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. Pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. A 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. Within three days 40% of the animals receiving pefloxacin died. Animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5% of these animals died. Thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - Comparative activity of ofloxacin and seven other antimicrobials against urea-splitting microorganisms.
AB  - Urinary tract infections caused by urea-splitting bacteria are severe clinical conditions and very difficult to treat due to their association with calculi, and because such bacteria form ammonium hydroxide raising the urinary pH and thereby creating an unfavourable condition for the action of most antimicrobials. We tested ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin against 143 gram-negative and 99 gram-positive bacteria, all urea-splitting, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. All drugs were tested using media at two different pHs (pH 7.4 and PH 8.5) and two inoculum sizes (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Although ofloxacin and norfloxacin had a similar spectrum of activity, ofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against gram-positive organisms. MICs of ofloxacin for 90% of Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and the Corynebacterium group D2 were greater than or equal to 4 mg/l. The activity of the other drugs varied, but there were many strains resistant to these antimicrobials. The pH and inoculum size did not significantly affect the activity of ofloxacin so that this drug should be useful for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the commonest urea-splitting bacteria involved in such infections.
TI  - Comparison of effectiveness of aminoglycosides and cephalosporins in gram-negative rods.
AB  - Aminoglycosides and cephalosporins belong among antimicrobials with a pronounced  effect on most gram-negative rods. In vitro susceptibility and resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested by the quantitative dilution micromethod. Selected, highly susceptible strains of the above species were furthermore compared for minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Aminoglycosides tended to be the most effective drugs for susceptible strains. In view of their relative toxicity possibly optimal combinations of individual aminoglycosides with individual cephalosporins are discussed.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), the product of the malE gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. It is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer Tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). In studies of the maltose system in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, we found that MBP is produced by Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Serratia marcescens. MBP from all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the E. coli protein and had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). The Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize MBP. The isoelectric points of MBP from different species varied from the acid extreme of E. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of E. aerogenes (8.9). All species with MBP transported maltose with high affinity, although the Vmax for K. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. Maltose chemotaxis was observed only in E. coli and E. aerogenes. In S. typhimurium LT2, Tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. MBP isolated from all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta malE strain of E. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - Role of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in endometritis after cesarean section.
AB  - Endometritis is considered to be a polymicrobial infection, involving aerobes, anaerobes, and genital mycoplasmas. Aerobic gram-negative rods make up 7%-25% of all genital isolates, but findings from studies in which special collection techniques were used suggest that many of these may be contaminants from the lower genital tract. Bacteremia occurs in 4%-30% of patients with endometritis, and aerobic gram-negative rods account for approximately 25% of blood isolates. Both selected therapy studies and studies of intrauterine cultures collected at surgery from patients at risk for endometritis suggest the significant role of aerobic gram-negative rods. Among them Escherichia coli is the most common isolate in both genital and blood cultures. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis rank next, followed by Enterobacter species. Pseudomonas species account for fewer than 0.6% of genital isolates. Overall, aerobic gram-negative rods are causally involved in 10%-20% of cases of endometritis following cesarean section.
TI  - [Carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  - Of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (Amp-R) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between July and December 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (Carb-R). This particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive Proteus (23%), Enterobacter cloacae (64%), Citrobacter freundii (67%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), Proteus mirabilis (75%), Serratia marcescens (90%), Escherichia coli (91%), Providencia stuartii (96%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). The biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. A constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. These enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. Two types of enzymes were predominant: TEM-1 (20 strains) and TEM-2 (7 strains); two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae produced both SHV-1 and TEM-1. The transfer by conjugation to E. coli K12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (E. coli: 9, C. freundii: 1, K. pneumoniae: 1, E. cloacae: 2, P. stuartii: 1). In all strains but one E. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Effects of antimicrobial agents fed to chickens on some gram-negative enteric bacilli.
AB  - Total and antimicrobial agent-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in fecal samples of broiler chickens fed growth-promotional levels of antimicrobial agents were determined quantitatively. Two 8-week studies were conducted utilizing groups of chickens fed antimicrobial-supplemented rations; the second study involved feed "pasteurization" as a means of minimizing colonization from the feed. Dilution/spread-plating/replica-plating techniques on selective media were used to obtain counts of total organisms and those resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, ampicillin, or kanamycin. The predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative organism was Escherichia coli, which was detected in all samples at levels ranging from 10(5) to over 10(10) CFU/g of feces. Less common were Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas sp., which varied in occurrence and levels from group to group (range, less than 10(3) to 10(8) CFU/g). Resistance to all antimicrobials (except chloramphenicol in E. coli) was commonly observed at incidences exceeding 10(3) CFU/g in the total populations. Colonization of the chickens' intestinal tracts by susceptible and resistant strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas sp. appeared to result from their presence in the environment of the newly hatched chickens. Ration pasteurization did affect P. mirabilis, which appeared to colonize from the feed. The results suggest that colonization by, and proliferation of, antimicrobial-resistant aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative enteric bacilli in chicken intestinal tracts may be less dependent on selection through antimicrobial supplementation of the ration than on their prevalence in environments from which they can colonize newborns.
TI  - Antibodies to proteus in rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - Antibodies to proteus species were measured in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and in healthy controls by a Coombs agglutination method. The titres to Proteus mirabilis were higher in 30 RA patients being treated with gold than in 24 patients with active AS (p less than 0.001), 28 patients with inactive AS (p less than 0.001), and 41 healthy control subjects (p less than 0.001). Control studies with Klebsiella pneumoniae var oxytoca showed high antibody titres only in active AS patients.
TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of amikacin in dogs.
AB  - After IV, IM, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. The pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. Amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. Intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- SD, n = 4). Within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. For isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. Cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. Widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. For dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (IM or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
TI  - Expression of Klebsiella pneumoniae nif genes in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Self-transmissible plasmids carrying his and nif genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae have been introduced into three his mutants of Proteus mirabilis: strains 5006-1, WR19 and WR20. Expression of his by the transconjugants was unequivocal, if slightly temperature-sensitive, but none was Nif+ when tested for acetylene reduction in anaerobic glucose medium using inocula from rich or glucose-minimal aerobic agar cultures. Succinate or pyruvate in place of glucose, low glucose, lower temperature or elevated Na2MoO4 did not allow nif expression and no nitrogenase MoFe-protein peptide was detected immunologically after exposure to conditions in which diazotrophic enterobacteria, normal or genetically constructed, derepress nif. One strain, P. mirabilis WR19, carrying the his nif Kmr plasmid pMF250 was examined in detail. The nif activator gene nifA was introduced on the plasmid pCK1. Such derivatives remained Nif- when tested, after aerobic growth on rich agar media, with normal or low glucose, with succinate or with elevated Mo. However, pre-conditioning by aerobic growth on glucose-minimal agar led to subsequent anaerobic expression of nif in glucose medium from pMF250 in WR19 carrying pCK1. NH+4 or proline could serve as N-source in the glucose-minimal agar. Maximum activity was about 5% of that of K. pneumoniae in our assay conditions. Material cross-reacting with anti-serum to the nitrogenase MoFe protein was formed. Nitrogenase activity was not 'switched off' by NH+4. P. mirabilis WR19 (pCK1) showed NH+4-constitutive temperature-sensitive kanamycin resistance (a nif-related phenotype of this plasmid) in aerobic glucose minimal medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - In vitro comparative antimicrobial activity of cefpimizole against clinical isolates from five medical centers.
AB  - Cefpimizole was compared with cefoperazone and cefotaxime against 6,599 clinical  bacterial isolates from five medical centers. Cefoperazone and cefotaxime were both more active and provided a greater spectrum of antimicrobial coverage than cefpimizole. Some of the cefpimizole minimum concentrations inhibiting 50% of tested strains were as follows: Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, 16 micrograms/ml; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.0 micrograms/ml; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus spp., 32 micrograms/ml; and the enterococci, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Screening of microorganisms for nitrosation catalysis at pH 7 and kinetic studies on nitrosamine formation from secondary amines by E. coli strains.
AB  - Thirty-eight strains of microorganisms isolated from infected human trachea, urine, blood and faeces were examined for their ability to form N-nitrosomorpholine from morpholine and nitrite at pH 7.25. Twenty-five bacterial strains exhibited nitrosation activity, including 18 out of 19 strains of Escherichia coli and three out of nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria strains; E. coli A10 strain showed the highest activity. Formation of N-nitrosomorpholine was proportional to the incubation time up to 2 h and to the number of resting E. coli A10 cells; the reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Nitrosation rate appeared to be dependent on the pKa value of several amines studied. As the nitrosation catalysis was heat-labile, our data suggest that N-nitrosation is catalysed by a bacterial enzyme(s). This reaction may lead to enhanced endogenous nitrosation in subjects suffering from an achlorhydric stomach or from chronic urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, Sch 34343.
AB  - Sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. Its in-vitro activity was determined against Gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp, Citrobacter spp. and Shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. Ninety per cent of strains of Enterobacter, Morganella and Providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. Sch 34343 did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against Enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. Sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. Sch 34343 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. Sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of Richmond-Sykes type Ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. It induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin) combination on strains of hospital isolates].
AB  - All strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). Augmentin is active against penicillinase-producing Staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. According to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, Enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "RSR" and "RRR" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are chiefly found among Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and indole + Proteus; in these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of Proteus vulgaris strains. "RRS" and "RRI" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. Augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some Acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.
TI  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (HR 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefpirome inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Haemophilus and Neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. It had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. Only a few Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens had MICs above 3.1 mg/l. The activity of cefpirome against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% MIC of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. The 90% MIC against Staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. Cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV-1, PSE, OXA) nor by chromosomal enzymes (P99, Branhamella catarrhalis, K1). Cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. Mice systemically infected with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for K. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Bronchial diffusion of piperacillin in 18 intensive care patients].
AB  - Eighteen patients (13 under mechanical ventilation) in an intensive care unit received piperacillin for pneumonia (7 cases) or bronchial infection (11 cases), related to Haemophilus influenzae (7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) or miscellaneous pathogens (7) including Staphylococcus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Each patient was given 2g piperacillin intravenously every six hours. Concentrations in serum and bronchial secretion samples were assayed by the agar diffusion technique using a susceptible strain of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Maximum concentrations were 157 micrograms/ml in serum and 3.60 micrograms/ml in bronchial secretions. These results are similar to those obtained with the same dosage by 0. Cars in serum (150 micrograms/ml) and by G.E. Marlin in the bronchial secretions (3.78 micrograms/ml). They approximate those published for other penicillins with the same dosage.
TI  - Interaction of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gram-negative aerobic organisms: effects on adhesion and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub MICs) of clindamycin on the adherence of these organisms was studied. Culturing these organisms in the presence of clindamycin (4 mg/l) resulted in significant enhancement of adherence for Ps. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis and decreased adherence for K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, the effect of pre-exposure to clindamycin on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNLs) function against these organisms was determined. Filtrates of Pr. mirabilis pre-exposed to clindamycin promoted PMNL chemotaxis. No effect on chemotaxis was noted with the filtrates of clindamycin treated Ps. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. PMNL phagocytosis for all the organisms was increased after they were pre-exposed to clindamycin.
TI  - Aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. Twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day I.V. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. Average length of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Proteus mirabilis (2), Proteus vulgaris (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Serratia marcescens (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). In 5 patients (25%) a mixed infection was observed. Sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. No adverse reactions were observed. Aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Comparison of the exoproducts of gram-negative bacteria by SDS-Page.
AB  - The protein exoproducts released during exponential growth of Gram-negative bacteria were analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-Page). The following bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia rubidaea, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella minnesota, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is demonstrated by SDS-Page that members of one species show identical protein pattern, whereas different species show besides comparable protein bands a species characteristic pattern. All members of Enterobacteriaceae were shown to release proteins whose molecular weights fell into the following size regions: Each strain was shown to synthesize a polypeptide of molecular weight 34,000 and one or more polypeptides within the molecular weight range 25,000-29,000. This profile was shown to be clearly different from that of Pseudomonas strains where 20 or more distinct polypeptides ranging from 12,500 to 160,000 Mr were detectable.
TI  - Detection of gram-negative bacteremia by limulus amebocyte lysate assay: evaluation in a rat model of peritonitis.
AB  - A spectrophotometric Limulus amebocyte lysate assay using lysis filtration and centrifugation has been developed for the detection of gram-negative bacteria in blood. The assay is directed at detection of endotoxin in viable and nonviable bacteria present in the blood-stream and not detection of free endotoxin in plasma. The assay was evaluated in a model of peritonitis in which rats were challenged with an inoculum consisting of sterilized human feces, barium sulfate, and one of eight species of bacteria. This assay was able to detect gram-negative bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the rat model when compared with sham-inoculated uninfected rats. The assay failed to detect bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus, nor was there a significant rise in absorbance when a pellet containing sterilized feces was implanted in the rat.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime against clinical isolates. Comparative study].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinically isolated organisms was examined in comparison with that of 4 other antibiotics and concluded as follows: Antibacterial activity of CMX was markedly stronger than those of cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole, latamoxef and ampicillin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, H. influenzae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus. But the MIC level of CMX against S. aureus was higher than that of CEZ.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of current disinfectants for leg bags.
AB  - An in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary tract infection in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. Individual disposable Uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. The organisms used were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Herellea, and Enterococcus. Each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. The tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, Sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. The results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. Sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. In the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. In practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in SCI patients.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - In vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of  norfloxacin in urine.
AB  - The in vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was studied. Norfloxacin effectively inhibited the growth of four gram-negative pathogens in urine in vitro at pH values of 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. The antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was reduced severalfold at pH 6, but minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at this pH remained clinically significant. Glucose at concentrations of 200 mg/dl and 400 mg/dl (simulating glucosuria of diabetes) did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin when tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin appears to be a highly effective antibiotic in vitro under conditions which simulate normal and diabetic states.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin in experimentally-infected normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
AB  - Systemic bacterial infections due to Escherichia coli MB 2884, Proteus mirabilis  MB 3125 and Klebsiella pneumoniae MB 4005 were well controlled by treatment with norfloxacin both in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. similar observations were made when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used against susceptible pathogens. Systemic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa MB 4700 was well controlled by norfloxacin and gentamicin in normal mice; this infection was more refractory to treatment by both drugs in diabetic animals. These observations suggest that norfloxacin may be an effective drug in the treatment of bacterial infections which may occur under diabetic conditions, and further investigation is warranted.
TI  - [Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerance of ceftriaxone in childhood].
AB  - Between the years 1981 and 1983 we treated with Ceftriaxone (Cx) 34 children--aged 15 days to 13 years--affected with serious infections: 18 infections of lower respiratory tract, 1 sepsis caused by E. Coli, 1 meningitis with cloudy cerebrospinal fluid, 1 submandibular adenitis with otitis, 1 otitis, 12 infections of the urinary tract caused by Proteus mirabilis, E. Coli, Klebsiella oxitocica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Whenever bacteria were isolated by cultures, sensibility in vitro to Cx was tested. Cx was given i.m. or i.v. at a dose ranging from 50 to 135 mg/Kg/die according to the age and the seriousness of the infections; in 17 children Cx was administered once daily, in the other patients in two divided doses. The following laboratory measurements were obtained before, during and after treatment: complete blood cell count, platelet count, total bilirubin, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and urinalysis. Patients were also monitored daily for clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, general conditions, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure. Twenty children showed a good clinical response (1 sepsis, 1 otitis, 1 adenitis, 1 meningitis, 12 infections of the urinary tract, 4 infections of the lower respiratory tract); urine sterilization was achieved after three days of therapy in all patients with infections of the urinary tract. Remarkable clinical and radiological improvement in 9 patients with infections of lower respiratory tract was observed while in only 4 children with bronchopneumonia therapy was ineffective although the dosage of Cx was adeguate; in these patients a further antibiotic treatment was necessary for a complete recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adhesion and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function with gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubation of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae with subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adherence and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms was studied. Culturing the above organisms in the presence of cefotaxime (1/4 MIC) resulted in reduced adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Furthermore pre-incubation of all organisms with sub MICs of cefotaxime resulted in significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Canine urinary tract infections: a comparison of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results and response to oral therapy with ampicillin or with trimethoprim-sulfa.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of ampicillin therapy in all 56 urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and S intermedius), in all 26 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 38 of 44 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 29 of 31 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 8 of 10 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 16 of 20 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 173 of 187 (92.5%) isolates responded to ampicillin therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results. In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa in 119 of 138 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 33 of 45 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, in 38 of 43 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 21 of 25 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 9 of 11 UTI caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci, and in 19 of 21 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 239 of 283 (84%) isolates responded to trimethoprim-sulfa therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - Synergistic effect of bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, anaerobic cocci, and aerobic bacteria on mortality and induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice.
AB  - The potential for synergy between aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria was studied by subcutaneous inoculation of mixtures of these organisms into mice and observation of subsequent mortality and abscess formation. The anaerobic bacteria tested included 12 strains of gram-positive cocci and two strains each of Bacteroides species, Clostridium species, and Fusobacterium species. The facultative and aerobic bacteria included one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Mortality increased significantly when each aerobic organism was inoculated along with either of the Bacteroides species. A similar increase occurred when the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were inoculated along with P. aeruginosa (four of six combinations) or S. aureus (four of six). The rate of abscess induction increased significantly when 10 of the 12 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were injected along with B. fragilis and when nine of these strains were inoculated along with Bacteroides asaccharolyticus . The results demonstrate synergistic potential between Bacteroides species and all aerobic bacteria tested, between Bacteroides species and most anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and between most anaerobic gram-positive cocci and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. The susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. The strains included representatives of Escherichia coli with different O- and K-antigens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Salmonella typhimurium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. In contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin B nonapeptide.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Volatile products from acetylcholine as markers in the rapid urine test using head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Head-space gas--liquid chromatographic analyses of cultures of all Proteus spp. showed that the production of trimethylamine from acetylcholine could be the marker for the detection in 3.5 h of significant numbers of P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans A in the rapid test for Escherichia and Klebsiella spp. in urine specimens. Trimethylamine was not detected in cultures of five other urinary pathogens. Six of fifteen strains of K. aerogenes produced trimethylamine from acetylcholine but were distinguished from Proteus spp. by ethanol production from arabinose. Ethyl acetate was produced from acetylcholine by P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, P. inconstans A, P. inconstans B, E. coli, K. aerogenes and Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - A comparison of the Api-10M commercial microdilution system with the tube dilution and standard microdilution methods.
AB  - The susceptibilities of urinary isolates of Escherichia coli (50 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15 strains) and Proteus mirabilis (15 strains) to gentamicin and ampicillin were determined and compared using the following methods: standard tube dilution, standard microdilution, commercial microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests. Results of susceptibility testing performed with the Api- 10M commercial microdilution method agreed with those of the tube dilution method in 93% of the tests, but in only 70% of those obtained with the standard microdilution method; tube dilution and standard microdilution agreed in 85.6% of the cases. All three methods of MIC susceptibility testing agreed with the disk diffusion method in 100% of the tests. There was a definite tendency for the Api- 10M system to give higher MICs than the tube dilution method; the standard microdilution method tended to give lower MICs than those obtained by tube dilution and the commercial microdilution system. The Api- 10M system is a reliable, simple and accurate method since it correlates very will with the tube dilution method.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil against clinical isolates of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared by agar dilution method. All drugs had comparable antistaphylococcal activity. Cefatrizine and cefaclor were more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. All four drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of Enterobacter species and indole-positive Proteus. However, cefatrizine demonstrated the greatest activity of the four oral cephems against these organisms. None of these oral cephems was active against Serratia marcescens or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  - We examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (Ig). For this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with Ig preparations. These were obtained from infected urine either by removal of Ig from ACB (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 M glycine-HCl, or 3 M NaSCN) or by staphylococcal protein A affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. Coincubation of either Ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, several Escherichia coli strains, enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with Ig. Coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. Adsorption of Ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. Coating was observed both with intact IgG and with F(ab)2 fragments. We further examined the proportion of bacteria coated with IgA, IgG, and IgM in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. The frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. Consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. It is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with Ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. A major problem of the ACB test is definition of the normal range.
TI  - Endotoxemia induced by antibiotic therapy: a mechanism for adrenal corticosteroid protection in gram-negative sepsis.
AB  - The following have been demonstrated: With a standardized model of P. mirabilis peritonitis in ICR mice, when optimal doses of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin) are given so as to reduce mortality maximally, abrupt and significant increments occur in endotoxemia, which cannot be attributed to impairment of clearance of endotoxin. Within the antibiotic-treated groups, these increments in endotoxemia correlate with mortality. The level of endotoxemia in the antibiotic-treated survivors is significantly greater than in animals dying without antibiotic therapy. MP, although unable to reduce mortality from P. mirabilis peritonitis in the absence of antibiotic therapy, does so when endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum. It is concluded from these observations that aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment can shift the lethal mechanisms during P. mirabilis peritonitis from those involving bacterial proliferation and low levels of endotoxemia to those involving bacterial death and release of large amounts of endotoxin. It is postulated that this shift in lethal mechanisms could account for the ability of MP to reduce mortality when used in conjunction with antibiotics. Finally, since animals surviving after antibiotic treatment have significantly greater endotoxemia than those dying without such treatment and since MP does not reduce mortality in the absence of antibiotic therapy but does so if endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum, it appears that endotoxin may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mortality from untreated P. mirabilis peritonitis. Whether the present correlation observed between the significant rises in endotoxemia produced by antibiotics and the protection afforded by MP extends to other models of gram-negative sepsis, or to human gram-negative sepsis, is under study.
TI  - Complications of maternal spina bifida.
AB  
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Evidence for clustering of RNA polymerase and ribosomal protein genes in six species of Enterobacteria.
AB  - 32P-labelled DNA fragments from the E. coli beta operon were used as hybridisation probes for homologous DNA sequences in chromosomal digests of six species of Enterobacteria. In all species the hybridisation pattern suggested clustering of the genes comprising the beta operon.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - In conjugational crosses, three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to newer types of cephalosporins. While Klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole and cefuroxime resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipients, the genetic analysis of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from Serratia strains to Proteus or Salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance determinant was also co-transferred. In subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin resistance determinants segregated in contrast to the relative stability of plasmids derived from Klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. From results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  - Since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. Addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. However, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. Growth in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). Addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. The results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.
TI  - Routine use of BACTEC 16B bottles to remove antibacterial and antitumor agents from blood cultures of cancer patients.
AB  - A total of 1,764 paired sets of BACTEC 6B and 16B blood culture bottles were collected from patients for analysis. The majority of the patients were receiving antibiotic therapy at the time the blood specimens were collected. A total of 126 isolates were considered clinically significant. Of these, 58 grew in both 6B and 16B bottles, 25 grew only in 6B bottles, and 43 grew only in 16B bottles. In both bottles, the same amount of time was required to detect a positive culture. In 18 patients, septicemias were detected in the 16B bottles that were not detected in the 6B bottles. In seven patients, microorganisms were detected in the 6B bottles that were not detected in the 16B bottles. Interestingly, the antibiotic therapy was changed for only 4 of the 18 patients whose septicemias were detected only in the 16B bottles. Finally, an in vitro study showed that certain chemotherapeutic agents can cause the inhibition of growth of several microorganisms when tested in 6B bottles. These inhibitory effects were reduced or eliminated when the same organism-drug combinations were tested in 16B bottles.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. The compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. It was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens). The MIC95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. The drug was less active against Staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (MIC95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. Levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. Due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the MIC95 of all strains tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
TI  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine and the antimicrobial agents gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cefalothin, cefotiam and cefsulodin.
AB  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, cefotiam or cefsulodin, used against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was determined by measuring the effect of the drugs and combination of drugs on growth of the bacteria in an automated turbidimeter. The combination of drugs was considered to be synergistic when the growth inhibiting effect of the combination was greater than that of the combined action of each of the drugs separately. Deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid together with either gentamicin or cefsulodin showed synergy in 10 out of 10, and 5 out of 6 cultures respectively, whereas deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid with chloramphenicol, cephalothin or cefotiam was synergistic in 6 out of 14, 5 out of 11, and 3 out of 6 cultures. This synergistic effect was much lower when microorganisms were incubated with deferoxamine combined with the various antibiotics but without ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid alone had no synergistic effect. When deferoxamine was saturated with iron, its antibacterial effect was completely abolished.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Studies on beta-lactam antibiotics. VII. Effect on antibacterial activity of the  oxime O-substituents with various functional groups in the 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and in vitro activity of the 7-[O-substituted oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins (I) without substitution at 3-position of a cephem nucleus are described. Effect of changing the oxime O-substituents (R1) with various functional groups in the 7-acyl residue on antibacterial activity was examined. Against Gram-positive bacteria, cephems with hydrophilic functions in the R1 moiety such as hydroxyethyl, aminoethyl and carboxymethyl groups showed decrease of the activity, while cephems with lipophilic functions such as cyanomethyl, methylthiomethyl and halogenoethyl groups exhibited increase of the activity. However, influence of the substituents (R1) on activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed to be relatively independent of the nature of their functional groups.
TI  - Evaluation of the updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system in comparison with the API 20E system.
AB  - The recently updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system software (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostic Division, Irving, Tex.) was compared with the original MS-2 Bacterial Identification software and the API 20E, using 968 strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The updated MS-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. API 20E and the original MS-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. MS-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. The percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. Organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic groups were tested. Direct comparison of the two MS-2 programs showed that the updated MS-2 software increased the identification accuracy of Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia stuartii, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. A decrease in accuracy was seen with Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. The remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. The updated MS-2 software appears to significantly improve the identification accuracy of the MS-2 Bacterial Identification system.
TI  - Norfloxacin versus cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - In a randomised prospective study 61 patients with lower urinary tract infection  received either 200 mg norfloxacin (33 patients) or 480 mg cotrimoxazole (28 patients) twice daily for ten days. Pathogens included Escherichia coli in 48 patients, Proteus mirabilis in ten patients, and Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in one patient each. The MICs of norfloxacin and cotrimoxazole were less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l and less than or equal to 1 mg/l respectively. On the tenth day of treatment 94% of the patients receiving norfloxacin and 89% of the patients receiving cotrimoxazole were clinically cured, and the pathogens were eradicated in 94% and 96% of the patients respectively. At six week follow-up one patient given cotrimoxazole and two given norfloxacin had a reinfection. No side-effects or toxicity were observed with the exception of a diffuse rash in one patient receiving cotrimoxazole in whom treatment was discontinued. It is concluded that norfloxacin is safe and as effective as cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower UTI and should have an important role to play whenever multiresistant organisms are implicated.
TI  - Susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
AB  - Of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in Hong Kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were Gram-negative aerobes mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were Gram-positive aerobes mainly Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1% were anaerobes mainly Bacteroides spp. The susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. Ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other Gram-positive organisms while most isolates of Staph. aureus and the Gram-negative bacteria were resistant. In contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against Gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against Staph. aureus and other Gram-positive isolates. The three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, but amikacin had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other Gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of Staph. aureus. The third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the Gram-negative but a reduced activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the Gram-negative isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative blood isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new 7 alpha-methoxycephem antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied, and the following results were obtained. The antibacterial activities of T-1982 against clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were determined in comparison with those of CER, CEZ, CMZ and CTT. Against S. aureus, CER and CEZ exhibited excellent activity, whereas T-1982 was less active with the peak MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml even with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The activity of T-1982 was equal to that of CTT and by far superior to that of CER, CEZ and CMZ against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, the peak MICs with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml being less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2-0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. Against S. marcescens, T-1982 was superior to CMZ and CTT and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml or less, whereas all the strains were resistant to CER and CEZ. The MIC of T-1982 against most strains of P. aeruginosa was more than 100 micrograms/ml. 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of T-1982 was administered by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion to 23 pediatric patients to measure serum levels and urinary recovery. At 30 minutes after one shot injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the highest serum levels of 22.0-38.8 micrograms/ml and 52.4-80 micrograms/ml were observed, the half-lives being 1.32 hours and 1.76 hours. When given by 1 hour drip infusion, the serum levels attained the peaks of 29.2-42.6 micrograms/ml and 49.0-75.6 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, the half-lives being 1.24 hours and 1.19 hours. The urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 74.2-92.5% and 50.2-66.5% by one shot injection and 63.4-84.2% and 53.9-79.0% by drip infusion. T-1982 was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg by 30 minutes drip infusion to a child with purulent meningitis. The levels of T-1982 in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after administration were 4.8-6.7 micrograms/ml with the CSF/serum ratios of 4.4-8.4%. A total of 36 pediatric patients (21 cases of respiratory tract infection, 9 cases of urinary tract infection and each 1 case of purulent cervical lymphadenitis, scarlet fever, purulent meningitis, acute colitis, peritonitis and sinusitis) was treated with 40-80 mg/kg/day of T-1982 (252.6 mg/kg/day in purulent meningitis). The response was excellent in 27 patients and good in 7 patients, the efficacy rate being 94.4%. Diarrhea or eruption were observed in each 1 case. No abnormal laboratory findings were noted in any cases.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in a general hospital: a two year survey.
AB  - For two years transferable antibiotic resistance (TAR) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. Transfer to an Escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 Enterobacteriaceae. It was most common in Klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least in Acinetobacter (6%). The mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (RMs) transferred was higher from Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter cloacae than from E. coli or P. mirabilis. K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more RMs much more often than other species. Some RMs were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with E. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with E. cloacae and kanamycin with P. mirabilis. The same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. Ap-Km and P. mirabilis, Ap-Sm and E. coli, Ap-Km-Gm-Tm-Cm and K. pneumoniae. However, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. Resistance patterns transferred from E. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Proteus were found only for a limited time.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone in pediatric field].
AB  - The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone). The results were as follows: The sensitivity was estimated by the plate dilution method on 28 strains of S. aureus 26 strains of E. coli, 27 strains of K. pneumoniae, 25 strains of S. marcescens and 14 strains of Proteus sp. isolated from patients. The distribution of susceptibility of S. aureus was 1.25-25 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 12.5 micrograms/ml. The strains of 84.6% of E. coli were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. The strains of 77.8% of K. pneumoniae were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.2 microgram/ml. The strains of 96% of S. marcescens was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. The distribution of susceptibility of Proteus sp. was 0.39-25 micrograms/ml. T-1982 was given to intravenous administration for 5 minutes and drip infusion for 30 minutes a single dose of 20 mg/kg of T-1982 to 2 and 2 children respectively. After intravenous administration of T-1982, the mean serum level was peak 88.4 +/- 8.7 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 52.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.6 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml at 6 hours respectively. Half-life was 89 minutes. And after drip infusion of T-1982, the mean serum level was 75.5 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes and 3.1 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml at 6.5 hours respectively. Half-life was 82 minutes. The mean urinary excretion rate was 94.7%, 57.4 +/- 11.0% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. T-1982 was effective in 13 cases out of 13 cases with bacterial infections. No side effects were observed except for 1 case with elevation of serum GOT, 1 case with elevation of serum GPT and 2 cases with eosinophilia.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - Relationship between cecal population levels of indigenous bacteria and translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
AB  - Translocation is defined as the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and other organs. The extent of translocation of certain indigenous, oxygen-tolerant bacteria from the cecum to the MLN, spleen, liver, kidney, and peritoneal cavity were determined in diassociated or triassociated gnotobiotic mice. Minimal bacterial translocation occurred to the spleen, liver, kidney, or peritoneal cavity. However, most bacterial strains readily translocated to the MLN. The percentage of the total population of each bacterial strain in the ceca was compared with the percentage of the total population of that strain in the MLN. There was a direct relationship between the numbers of a particular bacterial strain populating the ceca of diassociated or triassociated mice and the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain present in the MLN. Thus, the cecal population level of a particular bacterial strain determined the numbers of viable bacteria of this strain translocating to the MLN. The translocation of these bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract is an important first step in the pathogenesis of infection caused by members of the normal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Evolution of complex resistance transposons from an ancestral mercury transposon.
AB  - The molecular interrelationship of a transposon family which confers multiple antibiotic resistance and is assumed to have been generated from an ancestral mercury transposon was analyzed. Initially, the transposons Tn2613 (7.2 kilobases), encoding mercury resistance, and Tn2608 (13.5 kilobases), encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistances, were isolated and their structures were analyzed. Next, the following transposons were compared with respect to their genetic and physical maps: Tn2613 and Tn501, encoding mercury resistance; Tn2608 and Tn21, encoding mercury, streptomycin, and sulfonamide resistance; Tn2607 and Tn4, encoding streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance; and Tn2603, encoding mercury, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and ampicillin resistance. The results suggest that the transposons encoding multiple resistance were evolved from an ancestral mercury transposon.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefotaxime].
AB  - Susceptibilities of 737 strains of 19 species of bacteria to cefotaxime (CTX) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. Four categories were assessed. 1. Susceptibility of clinical isolates to CTX and 6 other antibiotics Against most strains, CTX showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs (CET, ABPC, SBPC, CMZ, GM, AMK), especially for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. Furthermore, CTX was more active than the other antibiotics against E. coli, Indole (+) Proteus, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp., S. marcescens, H. influenzae and E. cloacae. 2. Susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from sputum, urine, pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, CTX was occasionally less than potent AMK and GM against strains isolated from bile. Against P. aeruginosa strains derived from clinical materials, the following results were obtained: AMK greater than CFS, FOM greater than CTX greater than GM greater than SBPC 3. Susceptibility of clinical isolates in 7 different fields CTX was the most active antibiotic tested in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. But in surgery, CTX was less potent than GM and AMK. 4. Susceptibility of clinical isolates of inpatients and outpatients CTX showed excellent activity against many beta-lactamase resistant strains isolated from patients.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan, other beta-lactams and netilmicin.
AB  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan was compared to that of other cephalosporins netilmicin. Cefotetan at very low concentrations inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Poor activity was seen for all beta-lactams against Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. Activity of cefotetan against Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of ceftazidime and moxalactam. Netilmicin was the only agent equally active against all Gram-negative bacilli and Staph. aureus tested. Under conditions simulating serum levels cefotetan demonstrated rapid and long-acting bactericidal activity and bacteria exposed to these concentrations required up to 10.2 h to recover from the effect of the antibiotic. Six out of 15 strains did not recover fully.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of T-1982, a new semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic.
AB  - The activities of T-1982 (sodium 7 beta-[(2R, 3S)-2-(4-ethyl-2, 3-dioxo-1-piperazine-carboxamido)-3-hydroxybutanamido]-7 alpha-methoxy-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylate) against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were compare with those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, and cefoperazone. T-1982 was active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including genera resistant to the other cephalosporins. T-1982 exhibited greater activity than did cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, or cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens and was also highly active against Bacteroides fragilis. T-1982 was as stable to various beta-lactamases as were cefmetazole and cefoxitin. The therapeutic activities of T-1982 in mice experimentally infected with various gram-negative bacteria were superior to those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, cefazolin, and cefoperazone.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  - Basic and clinical studies were made on cefmenoxime (CMX) in pediatric field, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of CMX against clinically isolated and maintained strains was examined. CMX had stronger antibacterial activity than CEZ against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but CEZ had stronger antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. 2. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a one-shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 33.6, 15.1, 4.5, 2.5 and 0.6 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-life of 1.04 hours. 3. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 32.0, 55.2, 8.4, 4.2 and 1.0 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-lite of 0.96 hour. 4. A complete or partial clinical response to therapy with CMX was obtained in all 10 children with infectious diseases. 5. Bacteriological examination made on 3 patients showed that all bacteria had been eradicated, and that therapy was effective. The bacteria were E. coli in 2 patients and Proteus mirabilis in 1 patient. 6. The side effects produced were neutropenia, eosinophilia and skin eruption in 1 patient, and diarrhea in 1 patient.
TI  - Preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. We compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. A total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. Of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. There were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. Infecting organisms were Escherichia coli 45 per cent, Proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. Enterobacter species 10 per cent, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. Antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. All patients responded clinically. The bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. Three patients who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. No resistance emerged during therapy. Superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to piperacillin. Superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. The over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51 per cent respectively. Side effects in both groups were mild and did not require discontinuation of therapy. There were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.
TI  - Experimental Gram-negative bacterial sepsis: optimal methylprednisolone requirements for prevention of mortality not preventable by antibiotics alone.
AB  
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Histamine-producing bacteria in decomposing skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).
AB  - Spoilage in skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) was studied under controlled conditions by incubating whole, fresh fish in seawater at 38 degrees C, the optimum temperature for histamine formation. Bacterial isolates were obtained from the loin tissue of a decomposing tuna containing 134 mg of histamine per 100 g and a total anaerobic count of 3.5 x 10(5)/g after incubation for 24 h. Over 92% of the 134 isolates obtained were facultatively or obligately anaerobic bacteria. Eighteen isolates produced histamine in culture media containing histidine, and these were identified as Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Histidine decarboxylase activity of several isolates was measured in a tuna broth medium and with resting cells suspended in a buffered histidine solution.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Determination of the range of antibacterial activity by use of viable counts.
AB  - The activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (MACs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. The MICs were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. The MICs on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. The differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to fivefold (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). The MBCs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. For current practice, the MBC of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. The aminoglycosides showed MBCs which were closer to the MICs than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the MIC to show a bactericidal effect. The MBCs of oxacillin and cefamandole for S. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective MICs. The MACs ranged from 1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h MICs. The three endpoints, MIC, MBC, and MAC, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. The data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.
TI  - Clinical value of sensitivity determinations in treating urinary tract infections.
AB  - The results of bacterial susceptibility testing in 2,413 urine specimens obtained from patients with urinary tract infections indicated that in a high percentage clinical response could be predicted without the need for antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Simply identifying the infecting organism will provide the clinician with enough information to treat most urinary tract infections intelligently. The relative effectiveness of antimicrobial agents to enable the proper selection of therapy in patients with urinary tract infections is discussed.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide receptor on rabbit peritoneal macrophages. I. Binding characteristics.
AB  - The Bordetella pertussis endotoxin, labeled with tritium ((3H)-LPS), bound irreversibly and nonspecifically to rabbit lung macrophages, but bound reversibly and specifically to both resident and elicited rabbit peritoneal macrophages. The specific binding capacity of the macrophages was saturated with about 3 X 10(4) LPS molecules per cell. The binding was inhibited with the homologous unlabeled endotoxin, but not at all with endotoxin from Proteus mirabilis, thus assessing ligand specificity. Endotoxins from other bacteria gave intermediate inhibition value. Binding of tritium-labeled pertussis endotoxin was significantly inhibited by one of the two polysaccharides (PS-1) present in this endotoxin, but neither the other polysaccharide (PS-2) nor the Lipid A fragment exhibited such activity. These results strongly suggest the presence of a lectin-like receptor for LPS on the membrane of rabbit peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Laboratory surveillance of synergy between and resistance to trimethoprim and sulfonamides.
AB  - Results of susceptibility tests of Enterobacteriaceae isolated at 14 different centers demonstrate synergy between trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) against sulfonamide-susceptible isolates, which account for between less than 50% and greater than 75% of the isolates at different centers. Only 1%-4% of the isolates of Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis from the five centers in the United States were found to be resistant when tested with a disk containing both TMP and SMZ, but greater than 8% of such isolates from five of the other centers were resistant to the combination disk. A larger percentage of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Serratia marcescens were resistant, but the number varied from center to center. In the United States, resistance of human and animal isolates of Salmonella to the TMP-SMZ combination was almost completely absent, although greater than 50% of the animal isolates were resistant to sulfonamides. At a center that tested TMP and SMZ resistance with separate disks, resistance to TMP was found to be 30 times more common in sulfonamide-resistant than in sulfonamide-susceptible E. coli. This ratio may be useful as a monitor as treatment with TMP alone increases.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - [Curative action of mezlocillin on experimental infections in mice (author's transl)].
AB  - The curative action of mezlocillin on 10 severe experimental infections in mice was determined and expressed as effective dose 50 (ED50). The ED50 against infections produced by 5 strains of Gram-positive bacteria was distinctly lower than the ED50 against infections produced by 5 strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Infections due to Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the least susceptible to mezlocillin. The determination of MICs and MBCs of mezlocillin against the strains used in the experiments showed a linear relationship between MBC and ED50 for Listeria spp., E. coli spp., S. typhimurium and Pr. mirabilis. For strains of 3 species (S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and E. insidiosa) with very low MBCs, the ED50 was related to virulence. The diversity of the results shows that various types of experimental infections should be used when testing an antibiotic.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Biochemistry and action of clavulanic acid.
AB  - The destruction of amoxycillin by beta-lactamase action represents an important mechanism of bacterial resistance to the drug. Data is presented to illustrate that clavulanic acid used in the form of its potassium salt inhibits the amoxycillin destroying action of many different types of beta-lactamase for example: the staphylococcal enzyme, the clinically important plasmid mediated enzymes of the TEM, SHV, OXA and PSE types and the chromosomally controlled enzymes produced by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamases and potentiates the antibacterial action of amoxycillin are discussed.
TI  - [Pathological anatomy and pathogenesis of small intestine lesions due to opportunistic enterobacteria (Proteus and Klebsiella)].
AB  - Infection with opportunistic agents was reproduced in rabbits by introduction of  Proteus and Klebsiella bacteria into a section of the narrowed (but not ligated) small intestine. The presence of infection was documented by clinical signs, isolation of the causative agents, and immunological changes. Light and electron microscopy revealed an inflammatory process of the type of catarrhal enteritis with predominant involvement of the epithelial sheet ("epithelitis") and reactive changes in the base of the mucous membrane and submucous layer. Morphological differences of the infections caused by Proteus and Klebsiella were demonstrated. The level and intensity of pathological changes appear to be associated with the degree of conditionality of the pathogenic properties of enterobacteria.
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  - The adherence of staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3H-thymidine to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. Adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. Enterobacteriaceae adhered to Dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. The addition of velour to the Dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. In contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. The adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. However, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - Complementary activity of mezlocillin and the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid on Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The MICs of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and BRL 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2AM + 1CA), were measured for 331 Enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. The MIC values for mezlocillin and the combination 2AM + 1CA were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. When investigated separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA (Escherichia coli and Shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2AM + 1CA (Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and indole-positive Proteus as well as strains of E. coli and Shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2AM + 1CA than to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant Salmonella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae). This complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA against Enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.
TI  - Chromosome transfer and R-prime formation by an RP4::mini-Mu derivative in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  
TI  - The inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  - The beta-lactamase from Klebsiella pneumoniae E70 behaved in a similar fashion to the TEM-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. Both enzymes produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. In the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for TEM-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for Klebsiella beta-lactamase. Biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. This decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. This cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. A 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of TEM-2 beta-lactamase. Hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. The stoichiometry of the interaction with Klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. The penicillinase from Proteus mirabilis C889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. The major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. The cephalosporinase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C). No irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. The rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with Proteus and Enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid pH.
TI  - [Prerequisites for enhancement of the efficacy of fosfomycin by glucose-6-phosphate in treatment of experimentally infected animals (author's transl)].
AB  - In chemotherapy of otherwise fatally infected mice (intraperitoneally) the effective dose50 (ED50) of fosfomycin (2 single doses, subcutaneous application 1 and 6 h post infect.) was decreased significantly by supplementing the antibiotic solution with 100 mg glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) per kg animal and per injection if also the MIC of the infecting strain (Klebsiella oxytoca and K. aerogenes II) was lowered by addition of G-6-P (25 mg/l) to the nutrient medium (Table 1 and 2). With strains not exhibiting any influence on the MIC no such effect was observed (Table 1). From this it is concluded that the enhancement of antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vivo is based on the same mechanism as in vitro. This mechanism is the initiation of a second route of transportation into the bacterial cell (7), the hexose-6-phosphate transport system that apparently is inducible not only in vitro but also in vivo. Blood levels of G-6-P sufficient or above to induce this system in vitro (5 mg/l) were being held with doses of 100 mg/kg body weight in dogs during 70 to 120 min (Fig. 3) and 45 to 70 min (Fig. 4) when applied subcutaneously or intravenously respectively. These periods of contact area adequate to induce a considerable decrease of the MIC. With the strain used (K. oxytoca) the MIC of 128 mg/l was lowered by contact with G-6-P during 60 or 120 min to 16 or 8 mg/l respectively (Fig. 5). For full induction of the hexose-6-phosphate system resulting in a MIC of 2 mg/l however, 8 h were necessary. From the above findings it is concluded that clinical studies are necessary. As G-6-P is a (short-lived) physiological product of cell metabolism and nontoxic such studies are justifiable in cases where therapeutic use of fosfomycin can be regarded as an indication.

TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus ceftazidime, with MIC90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (MIC90 1-4 mg/l). The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MIC90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin. Against Staphylococcus aureus and Lancefield groups A and B streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. Group D streptococci were resistant. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. There were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and MBCs were within one twofold dilution of MICs. The addition of 50% human serum had no effect on MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Severe facial and cervical infections associated with gas-producing bacteria: report of two cases.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.

AB  
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Effect of combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam.
AB  - The effect of cefsulodin in combination with mecillinam was examined against a wide range of bacterial species. The antibacterial spectrum was widened by the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam in the ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. In overall observations, in the in vitro test, a synergistic effect against clinical isolates was found on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, and an additive effect was found on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In in vivo tests, a synergistic effect was observed on S. marcescens TN 66 and K. pneumoniae DT infections and an additive effect was observed on S. aureus 308 A-1, E. coli O-111 and T-7, C. freundii TN 518, E. cloacae TN 603, P. vulgaris GN 4712, P. morganii Tn 373 and P. aeruginosa U 31 infections.
TI  - Investigation into the antibacterial activity in vitro of cement-antibiotic mixtures.
AB  - An investigation was made into the antibacterial activity in vitro of CMW cement  and antibiotic mixtures. The results of this study are reported and the risk factors are discussed. On the basis of our studies, the use of this mixture in clinical practice would appear to be premature.
TI  - [Utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-KG) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-KG (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. Results of growth on, and acid production from, 2-KG were identical. A total of 990 strains was studied. No strain of Escherichia coli, Shigella (4 species), Salmonella (4 sub-genera), Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Edwardsiella (2 species), Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, Providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-KG. All strains of Citrobacter (2 species), Levinea amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter (5 species), Serratia (6 species) utilize 2-KG as sole carbon source. Different reactions were given by strains of P. rettgeri, Y. enterocolitica and K. rhinoscleromatis.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Hemagglutination of human type O erythrocytes, hemolysin production, and serogrouping of Escherichia coli isolates from patients with acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study potential virulence factors associated with Escherichia coli urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection. These factors were compared with characteristics of normal-flora E. coli isolated from stool specimens of healthy individuals without a history of urinary tract infection. The potential virulence factor focused on in this study was hemagglutination (HA) of human type O erythrocytes by E. coli urinary pathogens. A total of 265 strains of E. coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate human type O erythrocytes; of these, 148 (56%) were HA positive. Only 6 of 36 fecal E. coli strains (17%) isolated from healthy controls were HA positive. This significant association of the presence of hemagglutinin on E. coli that causes urinary tract infections indicates the likelihood that HA is a marker of virulence. Only 12% (5 of 43) of Proteus mirabilis and 3% (3 of 104) of Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary isolates were HA positive. There was a trend for HA-positive E. coli to be isolated from patients with kidney infections and positive tests for antibody-coated bacteria rather than bladder infections and negative tests for antibody-coated bacteria, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation (P < 0.025) between hemolysin production and HA; 67% (69 of 103) of the isolates that produced hemolysin also hemagglutinated human type O erythrocytes. There was no significant correlation between HA and motility, although there was a trend for flagellated organisms to be non-hemagglutinators. There was a marked correlation between the presence of hemagglutinin and the serogroup of the E. coli isolate; serogroups O4, O7, and O50 were almost always HA positive (57 of 63; 90%). In contrast, serogroups O8 and O25 were rarely HA positive (2 of 30; 7%).
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Some observations on the activity of three antiseptics used as bladder irrigants  in the treatment of urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling catheters.
AB  - A comparison has been made of the activity of three antiseptics that are used as  bladder irrigants in the treatment of urinary tract infection in catheterised patients. At the concentrations and exposure times used for bladder irrigation, phenoxyethanol (2:4% v/v) proved to be highly bactericidal against urine-grown cells of all the common urinary pathogens tested. Chlorhexidine (200 microgram/ml) was active against Escherichia coli and produced significant reductions in the viability of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but failed to eradicate Providencia stuartii. Exposure to noxythiolin (2.5% v/v) for 20 min had little effect in any of the bacteria, even though all strains tested had been recorded as noxythiolin-sensitive by conventional plate sensitivity tests. Contact with noxythiolin for periods of at least 1-2 hrs was necessary before extensive bactericidal activity was detected. These results provide an explanation of the poor clinical performance of noxythiolin that we have observed.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.

TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A, a derivative of fortimicin A.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A (ODMF), a derivative of fortimicin A, was compared with those of fortimicin A and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. All three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, with ODMF most active against Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. Activity of each of the antibiotics against group D streptococci was poor. The overall activity of ODMF was superior to that of fortimicin A for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ODMF and fortimicin A were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-N-acetyltransferase-I. ODMF and fortimicin A showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin G. The combination of carbenicillin with ODMF, fortimicin A, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. Inactivation of ODMF and fortimicin A when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. ODMF, fortimicin A, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin was the most active, followed by ODMF and fortimicin A. The superior in vitro activity of ODMF compared with fortimicin A against P. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Antigenic relationships between pore proteins of Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - Antisera were raised against the purified Escherichia coli K12 outer membrane proteins ompA-, ompC- and ompF proteins and protein e. Several immunological methods were used to investigate the specificity of the antisera and the immunological relationship between the major outer membrane proteins. Although the antisera had been raised against highly purified proteins, several of them contained activity against lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein due to minor impurities in the immunogens. The three general porins ompF protein, ompC protein and protein e were shown to be cross-reactive. Anti-(ompA protein) serum only reacted with the homologous protein. None of these antisera reacted with the phage lambda receptor protein or with protein III. Pore protein preparations isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloaceae and Proteus mirabilis were found to be structurally related to the E. coli K12 porins as they reacted with the antisera raised against E. coli K12 porins.
TI  - Expression of Klebsiella his and nif genes in Serratia marcescens, Erwinia herbicola and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Plasmid pRD1, an R plasmid of the P incompatibility group which carries his and nif genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to drug resistance markers derived from RP4, was transferred to His- mutants of Serratia marcescens, Erwinia herbicola and Proteus mirabilis. His+ transconjugants were obtained at low but different frequencies according to recipient genus. Transconjugants all acquired the drug resistance, and were Nif+ in S. marcescens and E. herbicola, having acetylene-reducing activities of the same order of magnitude as the parent K. pneumoniae and fixing 15N2. No evidence for nif expression in P. mirabilis transconjugants was obtained though the nif genes were present.
TI  - [The dispersal of pathogens from infected patients shown by environmental culturing (author's transl)].
AB  - During a two year's period environmental culturing was done to control hygienic measures, for pedagogical reasons or to trace a source of infection in a large university hospital. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus, pyocine typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and resistograms and biotypes of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter were used to compare patient strains with environmental isolates. It could be shown that the infecting organisms can be cultured not only from the site of infection where samples for bacteriological diagnosis usually are taken. But numerous sites of the patients' environment proved to be contaminated with pathogens indistinguishable from the infecting strains. These sites were for example: the patient's hands and other parts of his healthy skin, the outside of wound dressing, bed linen, clothes, floors and nursing utensils. The results convincingly provided reasons for environmental decontamination and for the institution of barrier nursing techniques.
TI  - Experimental infection in rabbits evoked by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae treated with gentamicin, amikacin and sisomicin.
AB  - Rabbits were infected with freshly isolated strains of Ps. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, E. coli or K. pneumoniae and treated with gentamicin, amikacin or sisomicin in a controlled study. Therapeutic results were evaluated by survival of animals and viable counts of etiologic bacteria in several tissues after sacrification of treated animals at the same time. Sisomicin was the drug of choice for Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis infections, when compared with amikacin and gentamicin. Its action is practically equal to that of amikacin in K. pneumoniae infection. Sisomicin appeared less active in E. coli infections than amikacin, but was superior to gentamicin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Combined antibacterial activity of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains.
AB  - Strains of bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics have been increasing in  number and are becoming troublesome in clinical medicine. The in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was determined on selected ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates. Synergistic effects were produced by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Bacteroides fragilis. Inhibition of the beta-lactamases produced by the ampicillin-resistant strains was confirmed, especially against the penicillinases mediated by the R factor and the cephalosporinases produced by P.vulgaris and B. fragilis. The inhibitory effect of clavulanic acid against beta-lactamases was irreversible because of the high affinity of clavulanic acid to the enzymes.
TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.
TI  - Effect of heavy metals on bacterial adherence.
AB  - A preliminary examination has been made of the effects of salts of heavy metals on bacterial adherence. 3H-thymidine labelled strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from sputa were incubated with human buccal cells and metallic salts. 10(-4)M zinc or iron salts significantly increased adherence of Enterobacteriaceae to human bucal cells in an in-vitro system. These effects were not altered by variation of the buffer system used, and seem dependent upon interactions between metals and bacteria that occur within about 5 minutes.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and clinical experiences of the combination sulfadiazine-trimethoprim in the short-term treatment of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (SD) combined in a small dose (250 mg) with  trimethoprim (TMP, 160 mg) and given twice daily were studied in eight healthy subjects. Both drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and their concentrations in serum as well as in urine could be considered high enough for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (UTI). In none of the subjects did the concentration of SD in urine exceed the experimental limit established for crystallization of the drug. Serum half-lives of SD and TMP were 10.8 and 11.8 hrs, respectively. In microbiological assay synergistic interaction was found in human urine with both the combination of SD + TMP and SM (sulfamethoxazole) + TMP on all the tested strains of E. coli, Str. faecalis, Str. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. A double-blind clinical trial was carried out with patients having acute UTI, using either the combination SD + TMP (250 mg + 160 mg) or the combination SM + TMP (800 mg + 160 mg) twice daily for one week. The results of the treatment were equally successful in both groups. Treatment failed in only 4 out of 85 cases, although in 12 cases the causative micro-organism was resistant in vitro to the combination of SM + TMP.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of co-trimoxazole and tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the newly developed combination, tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine, was evaluated and compared with that of the combination, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Tested strains were: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus faecalis. The components in both combinations were assayed in different ratios on a weight basis and activities measured as minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations employing serial dilution tests in Isosensitest bouillon in microtiter plates. It was found that the combination tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine acts synergistically -- as does the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole -- optimal antibacterial activities being achieved with a weight ratio benzylpyrimidine/sulfonamide of 1:1 or 1:5, respectively. In all instances, the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole proved to be of higher antibacterial in vitro activity than that of tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine.
TI  - Cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - The increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by H. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. An antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. Cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. Organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae in 6, E. coli in 3, Proteus mirabilis in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. The Serratia were resistant (MIC greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other MIC's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. Satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. Two patients died from their underlying disease. Adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included SGOT rises in 3 and rash in one. Serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to 12.5 microgram/ml (trough). Sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. Cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  - [Fosfomycin, a new antibiotic: in vitro activity compared with mezlocillin, cefuroxime and gentamicin].
AB  - In vitro investigations with fosfomycin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin  against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae an pseudomonadaceae were carried out by Agar Dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar. The fosfomycin breakpoint for the low dosage of 2-3 times 3 g per infusion daily was defined with 16 micro g/ml and for the high dosage of 2-3 times 5 g fosfomycin per infusion with 64 micro g/ml. At a concentration of 16 micro g/l fosfomycin more than 90% of the cultures of staph. aureus (penicillin-resistant), e. coli, proteus mirabilis an proteus vulgaris examined were inhibited. At a concentration of less than 64 micro g/ml fosfomycin 80 toi 100% of the cultures of serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morgani et rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gentamicin sensitive and resistant) were inhibited. Fosfomycin showed an absolute stability against many Beta-Lactamases of different bacterial species.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, Bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and Bay k 4999) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole positive Proteus sp. and Enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against E. coli, about as active as piperacillin against Pseudomonas, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus, but more active than piperacillin against Enterobacter species.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin, ceftizoxime (FK 749) with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - FK 749 is a distinctive new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum which is more potently active against a wide variety of Gram-negative bacilli, including the opportunistic pathogens such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens, than SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole. The activity of FK 749 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, pyogenes was by far superior to that of the three other antibiotics. These test organisms were not resistant to FK 749. The antibacterial activity of FK 749 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was almost the same as that of ticarcillin but was inferior to that of gentamicin and T 1551. The bactericidal activity of FK 749 against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was more potent than that of the three other antibiotics. FK 749, like cefmetazole, was extremely stable to beta-lactamases. In studies in mice, the therapeutic effect of subcutaneous injection of FK 749 against various infections due to Gram-negative bacilli was by far superior to that of SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole, was almost the same as that of SCE 963 and cefmetazole against Staphylococcus aureus infection and that of ticarcillin against P. aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Specificity of attachment of certain enterobacteriaceae to mammalian cells.
AB  - The specificity of adherence of various Enterobacteriaceae to different mammalian cells was studied in vitro. 3H-Labelled organisms of the same species isolated from various clinical sources differed significantly in their abilities to adhere to the same mammalian cells. Bacteria frequently adhered better to cells derived from sites other than those analogous to their original source. Bacteria did not display consistently 'high' or 'low' attachment to a variety of human and tissue-cultured cells and little selective adherence was demonstrable.
TI  - Incompatibility of R plasmids from clinical material.
AB  - Thirteen R plasmids derived from strains of E Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical material have been characterized. They belonged to many incompatibility groups and differ widely respecting other phenotypic characteristics, even if they come from bacteria isolated from a small geographic area.
TI  - Synthesis of a selective agar medium for Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A new agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. The final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(CIN) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of Y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees C or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. The medium was highly selective, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Colony morphology coupled with a differential reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of Y. enterocolitica from most of those Gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. Recovery and selective characteristics of CIN agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. CIN agar gave a higher recovery of Y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than Salmonella-Shigella (0.0/0.7%) and MacConkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - Effect of long-term tetracycline exposure (drinking water additive) on antibiotic-resistance of aerobic gram-negative intestinal flora of rats.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the effect of 2 years of intermittent administration of tetracycline in drinking water on antibiotic resistance in the aerobic gram-negative enterobacteria of rats in a closed colony. The bacterial isolates examined were resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and streptomycin for intestinal organisms were similar in all of the animals, regardless of whether the animals were sampled while they were given drinking water with added tetracycline or at intervals of 3, 8, and 9 months after the antibiotic was no longer added to the drinking water. Biochemical examination of the isolates from each principal showed that Escherichia coli was the predominant enteric organism. In conjugation experiments, all E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated transferred tetracycline and streptomycin resistance to an E coli K-12 recipient. Four different strains of rats that had not been treated with tetracycline (controls) were examined for tetracycline resistance. Tetracycline-resistant Proteus mirabilis was isolated from the intestines of these animals. Plasmid-mediated resistance could not be demonstrated. The E coli and P vulgaris isolates from these control animals were susceptible to tetracycline.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on the adherence of enterobacteriaceae to human buccal cells.
AB  - Antibiotics at bacteriostatic concentrations (four times the minimal inhibitory concentration) decreased the attachment of Enterobacteriaceae to human buccal cells in vitro and augmented the reversibility of such adherence. These actions of antibiotics may influence colonization by nosocomial bacteria and the subsequent infection that they cause.
TI  - Requirements of immunoglobulin and the classical and alternative complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of multiple strains of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli.
AB  - The requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement  pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were determined. Human sera deficient in immunoglobulin or classical pathway activity, or both, were compared for their ability to promote phagocytosis os and killing of 13 bacterial strains by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Seven of the thirteen microorganisms required immunoglobulin for phagocytosis and killing and utilized only the classical complement pathway. Three required immunoglobulin and utilized both the classical and alternative pathways. The other three microorganisms required minimal immunoglobulin and utilized the alternative or classical pathway, or both. None of the microorganisms utilized the alternative pathway in immunoglobulin-deficient sera or could be forced to utilize this pathway in sera deficient in both immunoglobulin and classical pathway activity. These results demonstrated a heterogeneity in the requirements for immunoglobulin and the alternative and classical complement pathways for phagocytosis and intracellular killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes among various genera of gram-negative aerobic bacilli, as well as among strains of the same species. In addition, the results suggested that a mechanism of classical pathway activation dependent upon minimal immunoglobulin participates in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of certain gram-negative aerobic bacilli.
TI  - Lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - When genetically serum-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter freundii, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin B, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. In constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. Synergy between polymyxin B and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin B to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. Polymyxin B-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, C2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or C6-deficient sera. These findings indicate that polymyxin B-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. However, C3 and C3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant E. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin B. This observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. Polymyxin B may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of C3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The effect of prophylactic tinidazole on the anaerobic vaginal flora in patients  undergoing gynaecological surgery.
AB  - The effects of prophylactic tinidazole on the vaginal carrier state of anaerobic  bacteria and the development of postoperative infections were studied in 50 patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. The results are based on a double-blind trial, using tinidazole (Fasigyn; Pfizer) and placebo. Although no postoperative infections other than urinary tract infections were observed in our series, this study shows conclusively that the isolation of anerobic bacteria from the vagina decreased markedly in the tinidazole group compared with the placebo group.
TI  - Prostaglandin formation in bacteria.
AB  - We report here that intact Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid, produce and release PGE2 and PGF2 alpha into the medium as measured by radioimmunoassay. The seven bacterial strains so far studied release 6.5-50.9 ng PGE2 and less than 0.02-0.51 ng PGF2 alpha per mg bacterial protein during a 1 hour incubation, quantities of the same order of magnitude as those observed in mammalian systems. PGE2 and PGF2 alpha formation in bacteria are inhibited by indomethacin.
TI  - Silver-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from hospital patients.
AB  - The inclusion of agar medium containing 0.5 mM AgNO3 in the hospital laboratory replicating system for routine antibiotic-susceptibility determinations resulted in identification of species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii) with silver resistance. Since the study began in October, 1975, 11 in-hospital patients receiving silver sulfadiazine for burn wound prophylaxis have yielded silver-resistant bacteria from their infected burns. During this treatment routine burn-site cultures from these patients yielded 230 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including 211 which were sulfonamide-resistant, 97 of which were also silver-resistant, and 38 of which were untested for silver resistance. Seven silver-resistant but sulfonamide-sensitive isolates were incidentally recovered from respiratory specimens from four nonburn patients with silver tracheostomy tubes, one silver-resistant sulfonamide-sensitive isolate was recovered from a small infected burn on the foot of an Emergency Room patient. Previous treatment of this burn was unknown. Representative AgNO3-resistant E. coli isolates from four patients were serologically untypable. Serotyping of representative isolates of K. pneumoniae showed a diversity of types except from two patients who had been in the same ward at the same time.
TI  - Experimental gram-negative bacterial sepsis: prevention of mortality not preventable by antibiotics alone.
AB  - Outbred Swiss mice were inoculated intraperitoneally or intravenously with one 90 to 100% lethal dose of Escherichia coli O:18, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. After carefully timed intervals, aminoglycoside antibiotics were begun at dosages nnd intervals predetermined to constitute optimal therapy. With progressive increases in delay of antibiotic therapy, mortality rates increased progressively from 0% to 90 to 100%. Standardized models of infection were developed by selecting delay periods before initiating antibiotic therapy such that 50 to 70% mortalities resulted. Utilizing these models, agents with reputed anti-endotoxin activity were administered concomitantly with the delayed antibiotic therapy to determine if any could prevent gram-negative septic mortality no longer preventable by the antibiotics alone. The following were observed: (i) adrenal corticosteroids prevented mortality that was no longer preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. The following were preventable by optimal aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy alone; (ii) specific antisera also did so, provided anaphylaxis was circumvented; (iii) in one model (P. mirabilis), such protection by adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum could be additive; (iv) adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum acted synergistically with the aminoglycoside antibiotics--no protection was achieved by delayed administration of the steroids or antiserum alone; (v) timing was crucial--the synergistic protective activity of adrenal corticosteroids and of specific antiserum with aminoglycosides declined rapidly as infection progressed; (vi) cyclophosphamide pretreatment markedly impaired the synergistic protective activity of specific antiserum and of adrenal corticosteroids with aminoglycosides; (vii) no reputed anti-endotoxin agents other than adrenal corticosteroids and specific antiserum proved capable of preventing mortality not preventable by aminoglycoside antibiotics alone. These included antisera to rough mutant Enterobacteriaceae of Rc, Rd, and Re chemotypes, anticoagulants (heparin), ascorbic acid, antiproteolytic agents (aprotinin), alpha adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate, indomethacin), nicotinamide, glucose, and insulin-glucose-potassium mixtures.
TI  - [Effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin (author's transl)].
AB  - With the investigations of the effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin, following experimental results were obtained; 1. Effect of combination of amikacin, cephapirin and hetacillin was differed depending upon the genus and species of bacteria. However, in general, in the cases showing effective results there was a relation in the concentration of these antibiotics. With strains of Escherichia coli amikacin and cephapirin was cooperative, but not with other combinations and strains of Proteus showed similar tendencies to those strains. In the strains of Pseudomonas, no effect was observed with these antibiotics. However, significant cooperative effect was shown in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococci cooperative effect was represented only a combination of amikacin and hetacillin. 2. Amikacin was resistant against penicillinase isolated from penicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus and cephalosporinase extracted from cephalosporin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. 3. When a strain of K. pneumoniae, showing cooperative effect with amikacin and cephapirin, was examined by electronmicroscopy, enlargement of cells and destruction of the cell walls were observed.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (BL-S 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. One Gram-positive strain and six Gram-negative strains were used. Bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. Tests showed that against Klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. Proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; Enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; Escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. The number of viable cells of Staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. On the other hand, Providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.
TI  - Epidemic occurrence of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - In case-control studies of three epidemics of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis  (NEC) in three different high-risk nurseries in three states, no particular risk factor was associated with affected infants or their mothers. Epidemic cases had higher birth weights and Apgar scores and fewer perinatal difficulties than those previously reported for sporadic cases. Seven infants fed primarily breast milk were not protected against disease. Early antibiotic therapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of disease in one outbreak. In two hospitals, affected infants who received antibiotic therapy during the first three days of life had a significantly later disease onset. The occurrence of the disease in epidemics and the decreased risk or modification of disease with antibiotic therapy support an infectious etiology for NEC.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Trimethoprim in combination with a sulfonamide for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim, in combination with sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole was administered orally for 7 to 14 days to 84 dogs with urinary tract infections (UTI). The daily dosage of 26.4 mg/kg (12 mg/lb) was divided into 2 equal parts and administered at about 12-hour intervals. Response to treatment, based on negative urine culture during or after therapy, was 37 of 45 (82%) for UTI caused by Escherichia coli, 11 of 15 (73%) UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, 8 of 12 (67%) UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 of 6 (100%) UTI caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 9 (56%) UTI caused by Streptococcus spp. These 5 species comprised 88% of the bacteria isolated from the dogs in this study.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant Serratia marcescens infection in a hospital.
AB  - Over a 12-month period, 74 isolates of Serratia marcescens were obtained from various sources at Tygerberg Hospital. The majority of these isolates were from catheterized patients with urinary tract infections, and were non-pigmented and resistant to all antibiotics tested, excepting amikacin and neomycin. All isolates transferred resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin and tetracycline by conjugation to Escherichia coli recipients as separate markers at low frequency. A non-self-transmissible plasmid conferring resistance to kanamycin, ampicillin and gentamicin was mobilized from Serratia species to E. coli, and became fully self-transmissible in subsequent matings.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activity of sulphonamide-trimethoprim combinations.
AB  - Sensitivity patterns of 326 clinical isolates toward sulphonamide/trimethoprim combinations were tested in vitro. The relative merits of the different combinations are discussed in their pharmacological and bacteriological contexts. It is concluded that organisms sensitive to cotrimoxazole as judged by in vitro sensitivity tests performed at 37 degrees C are also sensitive to sulphamoxole/trimethoprim.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefazaflur compared with those  of beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefazaflur, a parenteral cephalosporin, was determined against 590 clinical isolates. Cefazaflur inhibited the majority of gram-positive cocci at concentrations below 1 mug/ml except for enterococci. The agent was as active as cefamandole or cefoxitin against most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Although it inhibited a number of strains of Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Serratia resistant to cephalothin, it was much less active against these organisms than were cefamandole or cefoxitin.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - HR 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Cefatrizine activity compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefatrizine, a new orally administered cephalosporin, was tested against 400 clinical isolates. Cefatrizine had excellent activity against gram-positive cocci, inhibiting all except enterococci at minimal inhibitory concentrations below 1 mug/ml. Cefatrizine inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella at concentrations below 12.5 mug/ml. Although cefatrizine was not hydrolyzed by many beta-lactamases, it did not inhibit a number of strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, or indole-positive Proteus. Cefatrizine was more active than cephalothin or cephalexin against E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella. Its overall activity was less than that of cefoxitin against strains resistant to cephalothin, but its activity against cephalothin-susceptible strains was equivalent to that of cefamandole.
TI  - Defective cellular immunity to gram-negative bacteria in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - In vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients. We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram-negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.
TI  - Infections due to endemic, multiply resistant gram-negative rods: sensitivity to  and therapy with cefoxitin.
AB  - A nosocomial outbreak of infections due to bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics evolved into an endemic prevalence of several antibiotic-resistant gram-negative rods. The resistance of these bacteria to available beta-lactam antibiotics, a variety of broad-spectrum agents, and available aminoglycosides other than amikacin led to an evaluation of cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase-resistant cephamycin. Most multiply resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to cefoxitin in vitro. Cefoxitin therapy of 11 severe nosocomial infections caused by multiply resistant K. pneumoniae resulted in clinical and bacteriologic cure in seven patients.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefaclor (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the in vitro activity of cefaclor and other  oral cephalosporins against a large number of freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The activity of cefaclor against gram-positive pathogens is very similar to that of cephalexin. The action of cefaclor against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior. Cefaclor is the most active antibiotic against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and is also more active than cephalexin and cephradine against non-beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in intensive care].
AB  - Of 611 prospectively studied patients in a surgical intensive care unit, 177 developed hospital infections (29%): urinary tract infections (37.2%), pneumonia (22.5%), sepsis (19.7%), wound infections (9.6%), etc. The commonest pathogens were Pseud. aeruginosa, E. coli, Staph. aureus, enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In preventing and combating hospital infections in intensive care units, priority should be given not to antibiotics but to hygiene in the hospital. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis prevents neither hospital-contracted pneumonia, sepsis nor urinary tract infections. There is an urgent need for controlled studies on the necessity and selection of locally active antibacterial and antimycotic substances to prevent germ ascension in vein and bladder catheters.
TI  - Endotoxin in germfree, gnotobiotic, or conventional-flora Sprague-Dawley rats.
AB  - The Limulus assay for bacterial endotoxin was performed on serum and (or) plasma  from animals monoassociated with Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Candida albicans. Plasma from animals monoassociated with the gram-negative bacteria or C. albicans consistently showed a positive Limulus test while conventional-flora controls, germfree rats, and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with gram-positive bacteria or E. agglomerans were negative. Germfree and conventional rats were injected (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) with Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although no endotoxin was detectable in either group prior to the injection, by 1 h post injection endotoxin was in the plasma of all groups. The germfree rats appeared to clear the LPS quicker than their conventional-flora counterparts. Generally, LPS-injected rats (conventional and germfree) showed clumping and decreased number of platelets, a decrease in their lymphocyte counts, and increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts.
TI  - [Susceptibility testing with the autobac system (author's transl)].
AB  - The Autobac I provides an automated method for the rapid measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility of fast growing pathogenic microorganisms. To check instrument accuracy, 477 cultures were tested by the Bauer-Kirby method for comparison. According to the DIN limits, the results were comparable in 81.8%, whereas within the NCCLS limits the agreement was 86.5%. The discrepancy was found to be due to incorrect disc mass and different limits of inhibitory zone diameters. Another reason for disagreement seemed to be the incubation time, since its influence on the results varied when different bacterium/antibiotic combinations were used.
TI  - Stomach as source of bacteria colonising respiratory tract during artificial ventilation.
AB  - 10 adults had intermittent positive-pressure ventilation for 3--34 days. All 10 had paralytic ileus. Microbial overgrowth in the stomach was found in 9 patients (bacterial in 7 and fungal in 2); gram-negative bacteria predominated. The trachea invariably became colonised by bacteria, mainly gram-negative organisms. In 3 instances the gram-negative bacteria were found in the stomach before they appeared in the tracheal aspirate, and in 1 case the pathogen originated in the faeces.
TI  - In vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. The geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for different isolates of Escherichia coli (100 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (84), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), Proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive Proteus species (9), Salmonella species (19), Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. Its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa but not against K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. HR 756 was found to be bactericidal to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus species. Although the MICs of the tested S. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of HR 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.

TI  - SCE-963, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - SCE-963 {7beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[({1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-  1H-tetrazol-5-yl}thio)methyl]-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid}, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, showed excellent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter species, and Citrobacter freundii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of SCE-963 against most strains of clinically isolated Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were within the range of 0.2 to 0.78 mug/ml. These activities were about 10 times more potent than those of cefazolin, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. Variations in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the cephalosporin, but the inoculum size elicited a considerable effect on the activity of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteria. SCE-963 exerted bactericidal and bacteriolytic effects on Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. The pronounced in vitro activity was reflected in the remarkable protection in mice infected with a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus morganii, and Proteus rettgeri. The protective effects of SCE-963 in mice infected with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. vulgaris varied according to the challenge dose. The activity of SCE-963 was far more potent when the drug was administered parenterally rather than orally.
TI  - Analysis of amines and other bacterial products by head-space gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatographic (GC) head-space technique is presented, which is suitable for the analysis of volatile products in bacterial broth cultures. This is exemplified by studies on Clostridium septicum, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The media were acidified or made alkaline and after heating, samples of the gas phase above the media were directly injected into the gas chromatograph. A gas chromatograph equipped with dual columns and flame ionization detectors was used, employing Porapak Q and Chromosorb 103 as stationary phases. Analysis of acidified media, using Porapak Q, gave chromatograms representing acidic and neutral volatile products, while when analysing samples made alkaline, using Chromosorb 103, alkaline and neutral compounds could be detected. Interest was particularly concentrated on the analysis of bacterial amines. P. mirabilis was found to produce isobutylamine and isopentylamine, which were identified by mass spectrometry and GC retention times C. septicum produced ethylamine. The GC head-space technique described constitutes a means for rapid identification of microorganisms. It is adaptable for use on a routine basis in the clinical microbiological laboratory.
TI  - Differentiation of Serratia marcescens and Serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  - The production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the Enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. Most strains of Serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of Serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. Enterobacter spp. (25 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (15 strains), Citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and Proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of Enterobacter cloacae, two of Proteus mirabilis and three of Proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. It is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for DNAase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of BL-S786 compared with those of  other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro activity of BL-S786, a new parenterally semisynthetic cephalosporin, was investigated against 570 bacterial isolates. BL-S786 inhibited most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella. It inhibited some Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, but it was less active against these later species than was cefamandole, cefuroxime, or cefoxitin. It was not active against Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Bacteroides fragilis. BL-S786 was the least active new cephalosporin tested against staphylococci and was less active than cephalothin against streptococcal species. The activity of BL-S786 was not altered by the type of assay medium nor by 50% serum. The size of the test inoculum altered the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for inhibition of some organisms, particularly those with Richmond type I beta-lactamases. BL-S786 was not hydrolyzed by the R-factor-mediated, Richmond type III beta-lactamase, but it was hydrolyzed by type I beta-lactamases.

TI  - Pharmacology and efficacy of netilmicin.
AB  - Twenty-six patients, 20 to 77 years of age, were treated with netilmicin, mean dose 2 mg/kg every 8 h intramuscularly or in a 20-min intravenous infusion. The mean serum half-lives in patients with creatinine clearances of >/=90 ml/min and 60 to 90 ml/min were 3.2 and 3.4 h, respectively. In patients with serum creatinines of </=1.4 mg/100 ml and creatinine clearances of >/=60 ml/min, mean serum levels were 9.0 and 1.2 mug/ml, respectively, 5 to 15 min and 7.5 h post-intravenous infusion, and 7.1 and 1.7 mug/ml, respectively, 1 and 8 h post-intramuscular injection. Twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. The infecting bacteria were Escherichia coli (15), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Enterobacter hafniae (1), and both Proteus rettgeri and Proteus morganii (1). All were inhibited by 6.3 mug of netilmicin per ml, except for the P. rettgeri, which required 25 mug/ml for inhibition. Of 23 patients who could be evaluated, 19 were bacteriologically and clinically cured at follow-up. Of the remaining four, one relapsed, two became reinfected, and one was lost to follow-up. Five patients developed nephrotoxicity; two of the five had previous renal insufficiency. Three patients, one with abnormal renal function, developed ototoxicity detected only with audiograms. These studies suggest that netilmicin is effective in serious gram-negative bacillary infections, but is nephrotoxic and ototoxic in humans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of apalcillin (PC-904) against gram-negative bacilli, especially ampicillin-, carbenicillin-, and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Apalcillin (PC-904) is active against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli. Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (>/=3,200 mug/ml), half of them were susceptible to PC-904 at a concentration of 50 to 1,600 mug/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentration of PC-904 against P. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin (400 to 1,600 mug/ml) ranged from 3.1 to 25 mug/ml. Ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to PC-904. However, drug resistance to PC-904 was already apparent among some strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and P. morganii, recently isolated in Japan; i.e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14% of strains isolated were resistant. PC-904 was more active, on the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of Pseudomonadaceae, especially P. cepacia and P. aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of PC-904 were greatly affected by inoculum size when the organisms tested were strains producing large amounts of beta-lactamase.
TI  - Head-space gas liquid chromatography for rapid detection of Escherichia coli and  Proteus mirabilis in urine.
AB  - Measuring ethanol formed from arabinose by Escherichia coli and dimethyl disulphide formed from methionine by Proteus mirabilis is a rapid way of detecting these organisms in the urine. Ethanol and dimethyl disulphide are detected by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Since sedimented organisms and not whole urine are used the method is not subject to interference from compounds within the urine. When it was tested on 122 samples of urine, 94 from patients with suspected urinary infection and 28 supposedly uninfected control specimens, the results correlated well with viable counts by a conventional bacteriological method. As well as being rapid (results available in four hours) the method is reliable, easy to use, and could be automated. It now requires extensive testing in a hospital laboratory.
TI  - Homologous and cross-reacting antibodies in the sera of gnotobiotic rats.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. Comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that BL-S786 was half as active as cefamandole against Enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. In vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. Drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. In most instances, BL-S786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. BL-S786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with E. aerogenes, whereas BL-S786 was superior in experiments with E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin was slightly more active against Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. Piperacillin was active against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae including the Klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. The activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. Most striking was its activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain P. aeruginosa strains. A complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. However, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  - In vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cefaclor (Lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (BL-S640, SK&F 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. They were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. Cefaclor and cefatrizine were found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. Only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. Cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the cephalosporins were particularly active against Enterobacter cloacae. Both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against Proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive Proteus species.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of three oral cephalosporins: cefaclor, cephalexin, and cephradine.
AB  - Cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared in vitro with cephalexin and cephradine against 233 organisms. Evaluations were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar using two inoculum sizes. In agar, cefaclor had greater antibacterial activity than either cephalexin or cephradine against isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi. All three drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of enterococci, Enterobacter species, and indole-positive Proteus. Cefaclor, however, did exhibit the greatest activity of the three antibiotics against these organisms. Although there was wide variability with respect to test parameters, the broth results generally paralleled the agar results. In nutrient broth a clear separation of the results with these three cephalosporins was seen with K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. typhi. Cefaclor was the most active, cephalexin had intermediate activity, and cephradine was the least active. From the data obtained in this in vitro study, it can be concluded that cefaclor, which has a substituted chloro group attached to the molecule, had increased antibacterial activity over cephalexin and cephradine. Comparative clinical trials with cefaclor will determine whether the differences outlined above are of clinical significance.
TI  - [Microheterogeneity of R plasmid coded beta-lactamases in analytical isoelectric  focusing (author's transl)].
AB  - Analytical isoelectric focusing of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases in polyacrylamide gels gives rise to several satellite bands in addition to one major active band (microheterogeneity). When the R plasmids are transferred by conjugation into 4 different bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi-murium, Proteus mirabilis) the position of the main band remains constant, but the number and position of the satellite bands are changed. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of several beta-lactamines are also changed when the plasmids are transferred between these different host strains. These facts suggest that the bacterial host might modify the physical structure and the activity of plasmid-determined beta-lactamases. They also suggest that identification of beta-lactamases and comparison of their isoelectric focusing patterns should always be carried out using the same bacterial host strain.
TI  - [A new type of ointment base: investigations on its antimicrobial properties (author's transl)].
AB  - A new ointment base (PEN 32) consisting of polyalcohols prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi in concentrations above 25% (mg/mg). In a concentrated form the ointment base exhibited excellent bactericidal and fungicidal effects in vitro. This property enables the ointment base to be employed without preservatives.
TI  - A new pencillin with anti-klebsiella activity: 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new semi-synthetic penicillin, CP-35,587, 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, was investigated against 496 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and 113 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. All of the gram-positive cocci were sensitive to CP-35,587 except penicillin G resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. This antibiotic inhibited a majority of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis at a concentration of 6.25 microgram/ml. Also, approximately half of the isolates of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter spp. were inhibited at a concentration of 12.5 microgram/ml. CP-35,587 was inactive when high concentrations of organisms were used as inocula. CP-35,587 was more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, amoxicillin, ticarcillin and carbenicillin against isolates of K. pneumoniae, but other penicillins were more acte than CP-35,587 against other species of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefaclor, cephalothin, and cephalexin against 261 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae was compared. Cefaclor and cephalexin were about equally active against S. aureus. Cefaclor was the most active cephalosporin against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The effect on the antimicrobial activity using a relatively high and low inoculum was pronounced for cefaclor when compared with that of cephalothin.
TI  - A polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  - As a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PG) were studied in acute infections in mice. PG was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of P. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of P. aeruginosa. PG was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. The active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the IgG type and undoubltedly is directed against the O-antigen. PG was was not protective against challenge with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against Serratia marcescens. In a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced P. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to P. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. The apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. It is postulated that the successful treatment of advanced P. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  - Inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the WHO-ICS agar dilution technique. Cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, Haemophilus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. Cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. None of these cephalosporins was active against Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteeae, Pseudomonas, or Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of FR10024 a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  - FR10024 is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The in vitro antibacterial activity of FR10024 against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis is greater than that of any of the cephalosporins developed to date. Indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter are resistant to FR10024, as is true for the other cephalosporins. However, more than half of the strains of Enterobacter and Citrobacter tested were susceptible to FR10024 at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml. A single subcutaneous injection of FR10024 to mice with peritoneal infections due to S. aureus and several species of gram-negative bacilli gave a protective effect inferior to that of cefazolin but appeared to be superior to that of cephalothin. When given in two divided doses, however, the protective effect of FR10024 was enhanced and almost equaled that of cefazolin. The serum levels and rates of urinary recovery of FR10024 varied in different animal species. The mean peak serum level of FR10024 in humans after a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg was two times higher than that of cephalothin. The serum half-life after intramuscular injections of 250 and 500 mg was slightly shorter than that of cephalothin. After receiving 250 mg of FR10024 intramuscularly the urinary recovery rate was 87.7% in healthy volunteers. The biliary excretion rate of FR10024 was particularly high. The 24-h excretion of FR10024 in rats was 63.3%, this being six to seven times higher than that for cefazolin, which has the highest biliary excretion of the other known cephalosporins. When FR10024 was injected intramuscularly (20 mg/kg), it was found that the hepatic levels of FR10024 in rats were the highest of all the cephalosporins, including cefazolin, but the levels of FR10024 in other tissues were not as high as those of cefazolin.
TI  - R plasmids coding for gentamicin, tobramycin, and carbenicillin resistance in Serratia, Klebsiella and Escherichia coli strains from a single clinical source.
AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - [Demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria in the urine of pregnant women].
AB  - Urinary sediments of 64 pregnant women with significant bacteriuria which has been demonstrated several times before, have been investigated for the presence of antibody coated bacteria. Antibody titers were determined in the corresponding serum samples in addition and the results were compared with the clinical diagnosis. In 50% of pregnant women with pyelonephritis antibody coated bacteria could be demonstrated, while 60% of them had elevated serum titers. Taking into account both results in 80% of the pregnant women the clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis could be confirmed. Pregnant women with asymptomatically significant bacteriuria never gave positive results, whereas pregnant women with cystitis mainly did have negative results. The demonstration of antibody coated bacteria in the urinary sediments of pregnant women with significant bacteriuria as well as the detection of elevated serum antibody titers with the indirect immunofluorescence technique against the urinary strain were found to be of importance for the valuation of a significant bacteriuria.
TI  - Significant bacteriuria among the mentally retarded. Identification and antibiotic sensitivity of isolates.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of significant bacteriuria in a mentally retarded population. With 100,000 or more bacteria per ml. of urine used as a criterion for significant bacteriuria, 24 of 665 persons studied were considered to have significant bacteriuria for an overall prevalence rate of 3.6%. Seventeen of the 24 positive urine cultures were either from clean catch or catheter specimens. All patients undergoing catheterization were found to have significant bacteriuria. The individual prevalence rates of significant bacteriuria for males and females were 1.7 and 5.6 respectively. In females, an increasing prevalence of bacteriuria was found primarily in the 55-64 age group. The predominant bacteria isolated from bacteriuric patients were gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, being isolated in 50% of all positive cultures. Antiobiotic sensitivity patterns of the isolates indicated a high degree of in vitro resistance to both ampicillin and cephalothin.

AB  - We have treated 45 cases of urinary tract infection with cefazolin (i.m.) and cure was achieved in 35 (77.77%). 26 of the 28 patients (92.85%) with acute cystitis who received 250 mg every 12 h for 6-10 days were cured. 17 patients with pyelonephritis received 500 mg every 12 h during 10-14 days and therapeutical success was achieved in 9 of them (52.94%). Laboratory control was carried out at the initiation of therapy, at the end, and 1 month after therapy. Tolerance to injections of cefazolin was considered good and only in one case appeared a mild eosinophia.
TI  - Alteration of effectiveness of antibiotics by anaerobiosis.
AB  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests of facultative organisms are routinely performed under aerobic conditions, despite the fact that many infections caused by these organisms occur in anaerobic areas, i.e., intra-abdominal absess. Experiments were performed aerobically and anaerobically to determine the susceptibility of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and K. pneumoniae to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cefamandole. Antibiotic sensitivities were determined by disc and agar dilution techniques in air and in anaerobic jars with CO2 absorbed. Tube dilution studies were performed in air and anaerobically and time-kill studies were done in aerobic and anaerobic broth. The amount of aminoglycoside required to inhibit bacterial growth was increased 4 to 20 times by anaerobiosis in 20 of 25 strains tested. Time-kill curves showed that bacterial killing by aminoglycosides was markedly impaired by anaerobiosis. Anaerobic conditions had no effect on the rate or extent of killing by cephalosporins. These data may have significance in determination of antibiotic susceptibility of facultative organisms under anaerobic tissue conditions. Antibiotic sensitivity testing done on these organisms in air may not reflect the actual state of antibiotic-bacterial interaction under conditions of the infection.
TI  - The comparative efficacy of cephalexin and sulfisoxazole in acute urinary tract infection in children.
AB  - A double blind, comparative study of the efficacy of cephalexin versus sulfisoxazole was conducted on 100 children with initial episodes of urinary tract infections. The overall bacteriologic and clinical cure rates were comparable for both antimicrobials. Children treated with cephalexin had a clinical cure rate of 86 per cent and a bacterial cure rate of 84 per cent, while those given sulfisoxazole were found to have rates of 82 and 92 per cent respectively. However, cephalexin was noted to have a rather high rate of failure in the therapy of Proteus micrabilis infections (4/8), casting some doubt on its use in urinary infections caused by the organism. Untoward effects associated with either medication were minimal.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefoxitin, a new cephalosporin (author's transl)].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Cefoxitin (CEX), Cefazolin (CEZ) and Cephalothin (CEF) against E. coli (n = 380), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =108) and Staph. aureus (n = 47) were determined by the agar diffusion method. For Proteus mirabilis (n = 69) and indole-positive Proteus species (n = 23), the tube dilution test was used. CEF was the most active against Staph. aureus while CEZ showed greater activity against E. coli. CEX was the most active against Kl. pneumoniae and Proteus species. In particular, CEX was also active against pathogens resistant to CEF or CEZ. The good bactericidal effect of CEX was demonstrated by membrane filtration methods.
TI  - Human oral defenses against gram-negative rods.
AB  - Gram-negative rods are unusual pharyngeal isolates in normal man, which suggests  the presence of effective oral defense mechanisms against these organisms. To understand this protection better, we studied the elimination of gram-negative rods from the mouth after gargle challenge. Suspensions of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis (108 organisms per ml) were gargled by normal volunteers, and pharyngeal swabs for serial quantitative cultures were taken for 3 hours. Initial swabs yielded approximately 10(5) organisms. Bacterial counts rapidly decreased, and less than 1 per cent of the original inoculum was still recoverable 3 hours later. Studies of tongue, pharynx, and buccal mucosa samples showed the most rapid decrease in buccal mucosa samples and the slowest decrease in tongue swabs. To evaluate physical clearance, gargle challenges were performed using E. coli radiolabeled with technetium-99m. External counts of the oral cavity decreased rapidly, with 21.8, 14.7, 8.9, and 7.8 percent of the initial counts remaining at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively. Nonpiliated E. coli adhered poorly to buccal epithelial cells in vitro, in contrast to good adherence when piliated strains were tested. Despite these findings, no differences in radiolabel clearance was noted in vivo using piliated and nonpiliated E. coli for gargle challenges. Normal oral defenses against gram-negative rods are highly effective and seem to involve both physical clearance and local bactericidal activity.
TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of cephalothin on growth patterns of micro-organisms.
AB  - Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were incubated in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin. After destruction of the antibiotic, there was a lag phase before S. aureus began to proliferate again. When similar experiments were conducted with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, no lag phase was observed. This data suggests that the inhibitory activity of cephalosporins may be different for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  - Agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. Many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. All were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. Cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and less active enterococci. Both groups were equally active against Enterobacter, Proteus, and Providencia but inactive against most strains of Serratia and all strains of Pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-1654 were active against most strains of Pseudomonas. Penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against Proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive Proteus. Lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. Erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was much more active than either of these types of drug. Of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-P1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas BL-P1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin V were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. Of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. The least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least active against enterococci.
TI  - Formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation.
TI  - Factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. With P. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. Passive immunity against P. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized P. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. With S. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. These data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. The results further demonstrate that with P. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - Imidazo(1,2-c)pyrimidine nucleosides. Synthesis and biological evaluation of certain 1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo(1,2-c)pyrimidines.
AB  - The first chemical syntheses of the arabinosylhypoxanthine and arabinosylguanine  analogues of the imidazo-[1,2-c]pyrimsdine series are described. Condensation of trimethylsilyl-7-chloroimidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (1) with 2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl chloride (2) gave 7-chloro-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-on e (3) which on catalytic dehalogenation furnished 1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (4). Amination of 3 gave 7-amino-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-o ne (5). Reductive hydrogenolysis of 4 and 5 gave 1-(betaD-arabinofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-5-one (6), the arabinosylhypoxantine analogue, and the corresponding 7-amino isomer 7, the arabinoosylguanine analogue, respectively. The unequivocal assignment of the site of glycosylation and the anomeric configuration have been established. None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral or antimicrobial activity in vitro.
TI  - Tobramycin: in vitro and clinical evaluation in 30 patients.
AB  - Clinical evaluation of intramuscular tobramycin was accomplished in 30 patients with respiratory, soft tissue, urinary tract, bone or septicemic infections due to gram negative bacilli. Median sensitivity to tobramycin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (19 strains) was 0.62 mug/ml and range 0.31-2.5 mug/ml; less activity was observed for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species isolates but median minimum inhibitory concentrations were less than or equal to 2.5 mug/ml. Therapy resulted in clinical and bacteriologic cures in 16 patients (53 per cent) including 13 of 16 (181 per cent) with urinary tract infections; 9 of the 14 patients who did not obtain bacteriologic cure had satisfactory clinical responses. Tobramycin was effective for selected gram negative bacillary infections and particularly for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Clinical experience with tobramycin in the treatment of infections due to gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminocyclitol antimicrobial agent, was administered parenterally to 28 patients infected with gram-negative bacilli. The dosage was 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours, except in patients with renal insufficiency in whom the dosage interval was 10 times the serum creatinine in hours. Serum levels after intramuscular administration were 3.9 +/- 1.6 mug/ml and 1.0 +/- 0.7 mug/ml at 2 and 8 hours, respectively. Serum levels after intravenous administration were 4.6 +/- 0.5 mug/ml, 2.3 +/- 0.6 mug/ml, and 0.6 +/- 0.8 mug/ml at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 8 hours, respectively. Clinical isolates included 21 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 of Serratia marcescens, and also isolates of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tobramycin, gentamicin, sisomicin, and amikacin were determined for these organisms. Clinical results included 18 cures, 3 improvements, 2 indeterminates, and 6 failures. Minimal hepatic and renal toxicity was observed.
TI  - Diversity of beta-lactamase activity among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Various properties (specific activity, inducibility, substrate profile, and susceptibility to inhibitors) of the beta-lactamase activity present in 39 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during a two-month period in the bacteriology laboratory of a large general hospital were investigated. Among the 39 strains there appeared to be at least 16 distinct enzymes. Most enzymes from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus morganii were active against both penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas those from Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity primarily against cephalosporins. Both types of enzyme were found among strains of Enterobacter. There was a general correlation between amount of enzymic activity and levels of resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance may be due to variations in the roles intrinsic mechanisms play in resistance to various antibiotics.
TI  - [Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative bacteria. 1. Molecular and genetic characterization of R-factors (author's transl)].
AB  - With frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. Lately, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus and Pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in Zuerich. The resistant phenotype of two representative strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and Serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to E. coli K-12. Multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Providencia, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. Transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. Spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. Conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages MS-2 and If-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular R-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. This suggestion was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. After transfer of the R-factors of K. pneumoniae 1 (R-FK 1) and Serratia marcescens 2 (R-FK2) into E. coli K-12, plasmid DNA was labelled with (methyl-3H) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. Analysis of plasmid DNA then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and sedimentation constants. The analysis revealed that R-FK1 had a molecular weight of 54 X 10(6) and R-FK2 of 50 X 10(6) daltons. The values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. A comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid DNA from strain 1 and 14C-labelled DNA of E. coli K-12 (R-FK1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. These smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 X 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. The number of copies of R-FK1 in E. coli K-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of replication. It is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Proteus, Providencia and Pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the R-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.
TI  - Epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  - In a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in Oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated infections. Within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. By age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. Staphylococcus aureus and E coli were isolated more frequently in the younger group, while K pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. A higher frequency of Enterobacter sp and S aureus were isolated among male patients, while Candida albicans and E coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none of these differences by sex were statistically significant. Over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.
TI  - [Clinical studies on gentamicin (author's transl)].
AB  - Gentamicin (GM) was studied for on its antibacterial activity, absorption, and excretion, effect on the kidney and clinical effects. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibility of E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis to GM was almost the same between the periods of 1964 to 1966 and 1972 to 1974: No tendency of increase of resistance by year was noted. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains showing sensitivity to a concentration of more than 25 mcg/ml were isolated in 12.7%, in the latter period (1972-1974), as compared with the former period (1964-1966), which was 0%. 2. Blood levels: The peak level of GM in blood was obtained at 30 minutes after intramuscular injection to a healthy human. The peak level was 7.6 mcg/ml with 40 mg dose, 8.7 mcg/ml with 60 mg and 10.6 mcg/ml with 80 mg, showing a dose-responding curve. The half-life of GM absorption was 1.1 hours with 40 mg dose, 1.3 hours with 60 mg and 1.6 hours with 80 mg, showing also a dose related tendency. 3. Urinary levels: The peak level of GM in urine, about 200 mcg/ml, was noted in 0-2 hours after intramuscular injection of GM to a healthy human. The urinary recovery was about 44% in 6 hours. 4. Effect on the kidney: The effects of GM on the kidney was studied in rats administering 20 mg/kg once a day for 21 days consecutively. The results obtained are a slight increase (20 mg/dl) in BUN and a slight decrease (2,600 mosm/kg H2O) in urinary osmotic pressure; and urea lysozyme showed tendency to increase from the third day, the same as with kanamycin. Meanwhile, in the histopathological findings of the kidney tissue, the vacuolar degeneration and flattening of renal tubules were noted. Similar findings were obtained with kanamycin in a similar type of experiment. These results indicate that nephrotoxicity of GM is considered to be approximately the same as that of kanamycin. 5. CLINICAL RESULTS: GM was injected into 22 patients with various infectious diseases (respiratory tract infections 7, liver abscess 1, urinary tract infections 14). Excellent efficacy was noted in 7 patients, good in 13 and no effect in 2. The effective rate was 90.9%. No serious side effect was noted in this clinical trial.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - Derivation and properties of F-prime factors in Escherichia coli carrying nitrogen fixation genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A His+ Nif+ Escherichia coli K12, Hfr strain (UNF43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a Klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (HF3) and a his-HFR E. coli strain (SBI824) which transfers his as an early marker. An F-prime nif plasmid, FN39, carrying genes which correspond to the E. coli chromosomal region, metG gnd his shiA, but excluding purF and aroD, was isolated from UNF43. Translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a P-type R-factor, R68, to FN39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative F-prime, FN68. Sedimentation analysis of both F-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(CCC) DNA species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. It is suggested that the two smallest CCC-DNA species are component replicons of the composite F-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are CCC-dimers. FN68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium but not to Proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to Erwinia herbicola. nif genes on FN68 were expressed in a Nif- mutant of K. pneumoniae and also in S. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of FN68 became temperature-sensitive in S. typhimurium.
TI  - In vitro studies of cefamandole.
AB  - Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin antibiotic that was tested in vitro against 540 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. A concentration of 0.39 mug/ml inhibited 95% of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. A concentration of 6.25 mug/ml inhibited over 90% of the isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, 69% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 31% of the isolates of indole-positive Proteus spp. and Enterobacter spp. It was active against most cephalothin-resistant isolates of E. coli but not of K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid in R factor-harboring Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from 24 different R factor-harboring Enterobacteriaceae was isolated and characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. The R factors represented 15 different patterns of transferable drug resistance found in enterobacteria from an enclosed geographic area. All of the strains contained extrachromosomal, circular DNA molecules within the range of 0.4 to 52 mum. More than one size class of circular DNA molecules was observed in the majority of the extrachromosomal DNA preparations. The buoyant density of the extrachromosomal DNA ranged from 1.700 to 1.720 g/cm3. The majority of the bacteria contained extrachromosomal DNAs of various densities. Three-fourths of the R factors were classified as fi+. The investigation illustrates the extensive variability in the physical characteristics of plasmid DNA from R factor-harboring strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ribostamycin on Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The study of the inhibitory activity of ribostamvcin (Vistamycin), an antibiotic  derived from Streptomyces ribosidificus, on 161 strains of Gram-negative bacilli shows that the antibacterial spectrum of this antibiotic is identical to that of kanamycin. If controlled clinical studies confirm that ribostamycin is less toxic than kanamycin on the otovestibular system, this antibiotic will constitute a real therapeutic advance.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of resistance to gentamicin in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of the occurrence of resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria revealed a 3-fold increase in the percentage of resistant strains between 1974 (4%), and 1976 (12%). Gentamicin resistance was mainly found in isolates from hospitalized patients. Serratia (35--78%), Proteus inconstans (53--62%), Klebsiella (6--21%), Acinetobacter (9--17%) and Pseudomonas (9--14%) exhibited the highest percentage of resistance to this drug. Gentamicin inactivating enzymes were detected in 16 selected resistant isolates. Of these, ten strains (Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas, E. coli) produced the aminoglycoside 2''-adenylyltransferase, five (Proteus, indole-positive) the aminoglycoside 2'-N-acetyltransferase and one isolate (Proteus mirabilis) the aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase. Eight of the 16 strains were able to transfer gentamicin resistance and certain other resistance markers to appropriate receptor strains during mixed cultivation, indicating the presence of transferable plasmid-mediated resistance.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of penicillins and cephalosporines in urine  (author's transl)].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CEF), cefazolin (CEZ), carbenicillin (CAR) and ticarcillin (TIC) were determined against Strep. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Prot. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa in Sensitivity Test Broth (STB) and human urine. Marked differences were seen in MIC between these two media, especially against P. mirabilis strains tested. Against E. coli the MIC of AMP, CEF and CEZ were similar or slightly lower in urine than in STB. MIC for CAR against E. coli were higher in urine. Against K. pneumoniae the MIC for CEF and CEZ were 2-4fold higher in urine than in STB. The activity of CAR and TIC against Ps. aeruginosa was lower in urine. Albeit high concentrations of antibiotics (up to 800fold) no inhibition was achieved in urine against P. mirabilis by AMP, CEF or CEZ. Only against Strep. faecalis all tested antibiotics had lower MIC in urine than in STB.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of antibiotics in human bile (author's transl)].
AB  - Marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  Whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. The differences in activity are related to the pH although not all deviations can be attributed to the effect of the pH. These results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.
TI  - Chemistry and antibacterial activity of nitrobenzofurans.
AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.
TI  - [In vitro effect of cephacetril and colistin combinations on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus Strains (author's transl)].
AB  - In 14 out of 43 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (33%) the combination cephacetril-colistin showed a synergistic, in 11 strains (25%) an additive effect. In Proteus strains no synergistic action was found. The combination was more likely to be synergistic or additive in strains requiring higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephacetril and colistin. Most highly resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were synergistically inhibited by concentrations of both drugs, which can easily be obtained in serum by usual clinical doses.
TI  - In vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. Cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against Proteus mirabilis. Both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against S. aureus, were slightly more active against K. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against E. coli. All strains of indole-positive Proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. Eighty-eight percent of Enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. Peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. These levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. There was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. The percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. The half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Effect of surfactants on antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The effectiveness of surfactants as potentiators of antibiotic activity on several resistant strains of bacteria, selected from clinical sources and laboratory collections, was studied using a tube dilution assay. Bacterial strains included members of the Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Tween 80 (Tw80), a mixture of n-alkyldimethyl betaines (L14), and alpha-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (TCP) were tested in combination with pencillin G (PenG), methicillin (Met), streptomycin (Sm), polymyxin B (PmB), and chlortetracycline (CTC). Growth response to the drug combinations was compared with the response to each drug alone. CTAB and L14 but not Tw80 or TCP were found to potentiate the activity of CTC on strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Studies on the inhibition of protein synthesis by CTC in cells of a strain of E. coli suggested that the surfactants increased the uptake of antibiotic into the cells. CTAB and L14 almost completely sensitized strains of P. mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli to PmB. With the exception of K. pneumoniae, TCP was also effective in potentiating the activity of PmB on the above strains whereas Tw80 showed potentiation only with a strain of E. coli. CTAB and L14 but not TCP or Tw80 potentiated the activity of PenG but not Met on strains of staphylococci. Studies of penicillinase in the cells suggested that the surfactants inhibited the formation of this enzyme possibly at the level of induction. None of the surfactants were found to potentiate the activity of Sm.
TI  - Prevalence of gram-negative rods in the normal pharyngeal flora.
AB  - We obtained throat cultures from 100 randomly selected people free from any chronic upper or lower respiratory disease who did not work in a hospital and who had not experienced any acute illness or received any antibacterial therapy in the 4 weeks preceding culture. Eighteen percent harbored either a species of Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their pharynx. In all cases, colony counts were low, the majority being detected in broth media selective for Gram-negative rods. There were no clear-cut age or sex distributions of Gram-negative pharyngeal carriage. These data imply that, in at least some cases, isolation of Gram-negative rods from sputum of untreated patients may be a normal finding, and that in some patients with pulmonary infection, the pretreatment, upper respiratory tract flora may serve as the source of subsequent superinfection with Gram-negative rods.
TI  - Bacterial studies of Clindamycin-associated colitis. A preliminary report.
AB  - The cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. To test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. We were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. Those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. Those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. A third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. Thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the anaerobic microflora of the colon. The symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. Resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.
TI  - [The fundamental and clinical studies on PT-122M (doxycycline) in the otorhinolaryngological field (author's transl)].
AB  - As the results of laboratory and clinical investigation with a new tetracycline derivate, PT-122M (doxycycline) was performed with the results which may lead to the following conclusions. 1) In vitro antibacterial activity: The minimal inhibitory concentration of doxycycline (DOTC) was measured by an agar plate dilution method. The MIC of DOTC against 60 strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus isolated from otorrhoea was distributed over a range of 0.2 approximately 1.56 mcg/ml and 12.5 approximately 50 mcg/ml. Furthermore, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 3.13 to 100 mcg/ml. 2) Concentration in blood: The blood level of DOTC in healthy adults who were given 100 mg of DOTC intravenous reached maximum of 1.97 mcg/ml on the average 15 minutes after injection. Even at 12 hours after intravenous injection clinically effective serum DOTC concentration of 0.47 mcg/ml was still demonstrable. 3) CLINICAL RESULTS: PT-122M (DOCT) was intravenously injected into 30 cases with typical infection in the field of otorhinolaryngology. It was excellent in 15 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 3 cases, and poor in 2 cases. When the cases in which it was excellent and good were considered together, good results were obtained in 25 cases, a ratio of effectiveness being 83 per cent. 4) Side effect: The comparative examination of hepatic function, electrolyte and auditory acuity before and after injection showed no significant disturbance. No side effect was shown with the intravenous injection.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Authenic tracheobronchial secretions/exudates (TBSE) were aspirated under direct  vision via a sterile catheter passed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic bronchitis. TBSE, saliva and blood were obtained during long-term administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and were assayed for drug content. Before and during treatment TBSE were cultured qualitatively and quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and viruses. Treatment with TMP-SMX was associated with a decrease in the recovery of Hemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis; however, little effect was observed on the typically nonpathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. TMP was found in saliva at concentrations greater than in serum. Both TMP and SMX entered TBSE in absolute and relative concentrations sufficient to take advantage of the potential for synergy against susceptible microorganisms. Patient tolerance of TMP-SMX was generally good and several patients reported a decrease in production of sputum during treatment.
TI  - Use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group D streptococci. All members of the Enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. One thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. Heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 C. The slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. Shigella, Salmonella, Arizona, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Providencia alcalifaciens, and Providencia stuartii all produced negative results. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. The other remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. The use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group from other Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.
TI  - Herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 California herds. The severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of enteric bacteria from blood cultures.
AB  - The BACTEC radiometric system and Inolex Enteric I card were used in conjunction  for the rapid detection and presumptive identification of enteric gram-negative rods in blood cultures. Excellent correlation was obtained between the Inolex card and routine identification techniques when organisms from both artificially inoculated and clinical blood cultures were studied. In many instances, the culture report was available less than 24 hr after receipt of the specimen.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at National Taiwan University Hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. Cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except Enterococci. Staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. More than 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. The relative potency of cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. The gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. Among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. The relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against E. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. One hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. The sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. Very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.
TI  - Determining antibiotic levels in the blood.
AB  - Methods for the rapid determination of antibiotic blood levels require particular organisms or special conditions or long incubation. A method was developed for the rapid determination of antibiotic blood levels which requires no special equipment and is rapid. Special stains are not required. Utilizing bacteria from standard Kirby-Bauer sensitivity plates, a suspension is prepared and a pour plate made. Organisms which are sensitive to the questioned antibiotic and resistant to other antibiotics the patient is receiving are chosen. Muller-Hinton is the best general agar. Wells are cut, and antibiotic standards, antibiotic controls, and the patient's serum introduced. Within three to four hours, zone sizes can be read and the antibiotic blood level calculated. The materials and technical facility required should not preclude any laboratory from successfully performing the method.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic nitroheterocycles. 18. 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones substituted by aminoalkoxy groups.
AB  - 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones  substituted by aminoalkoxy groups and related compounds (41-69, table ii) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were evaluated (table iii). Some of these compounds (e.g. 47, 52, and 59) suprisingly exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum including Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extraordinary antitrichomonal activities could also be observed in vitro (MIC of compound 59, 0.0004 pg/ml) and six of the title compounds (48, 49, 52, 58, 64, 66) displayed in vivo activity in mice against Trichomonas vaginalis comparable to that of metronidazole (70).
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in Newcastle upon Tyne.
AB  - A screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in Newcastle upon Tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. In girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged 12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. Renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with ASB. Neither the prevalence nor the severity of renal scarring increased with age. There was no association between ASB and social class. Of the 254 girls with ASB, 24% had no symptoms. Infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with Esch. coli. The prevalence of ASB in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18 was low, 0.2%. Ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (P less than 0.001). Renal scarring also showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. The greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. This study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. It therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of ASB.
TI  - Computer surveillance of shifts in the gross patient flora during hospitalization.
AB  - Data accumulating routinely in a hospital microbiology laboratory were computer-plotted according to the number of days the patient had been in the hospital when each culture was obtained. The rate at which patients were cultured fell slightly during hospitalization, while the rate at which isolates were obtained from them increased gradually. For some species, such as Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, isolation rates changed little during hospitalization. They rose as much as sevenfold for other species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Serratia marcescens, or for a particular antibiotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae while it was an endemic nosocomial problem. These differences persisted after deletion of repeat isolates from the same patient. They appeared to reflect general shifts in composition of patient flora during hospitalization. These shifts paralleled shifts in infecting flora as represented by similar plots of isolates from blood cultures.
TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of BB-K8 and three other aminoglycosides against 215 strains of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae with variable sensitivity to kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  - 215 gram-negative bacilli isolated from clinical materials were tested in vitro against BB-K8 by means of disc diffusion and agar dilution tests; the strains included 40 isolates resistant to gentamicin. Approximately 90% of the strains were inhibited by 3.12 mug/ml or less BB-K8. This antibiotic exhibited a comparable activity, although somewhat inferior, to that of gentamicin, against organisms sensitive to gentamicin. It was considrably more active than gentamicin, and comparable to tobramycin, against the isolates of Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia spp. resistant to gentamicin, but less active than tobramycin against 11 strains of Pseudomonas resistant to gentamicin.
TI  - [Synthetic medium for testing of susceptibility. II. Susceptibility of bacteria to sulphonamides (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study of 9 media for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to 7 sulphonamides has been carried out. The evaluated culture-media included 4 "Mueller Hinton" media (MH), 4 others based on the formula of the "Diagnostic Sensitivity Test" agar base (D.S.T.) and a "Synthetic Medium" (SM) which has been developed in our laboratory. MH and D.S.T. culture-media have been supplied by 4 manufacturing companies in Europe and USA. A total number of 21 bacterial cultures have been employed. The included species belong to the gram negative genera Citrobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia and Shigella, and to the gram positive genus Streptococcus. Sulphafurazole, sulphasomidine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, sulphaphenazole and sulphamethoxydiazine have been investigated. SM proved to be clearly superior to the other 8 culture-media mentioned above. Just one MH afforded good results. The 3 other MH and 2 D.S.T. media were not quite satisfactory. The two remaining D.S.T. media were unsuitable. Moreover, the activity of the tested sulphonamides was not equally high against the concerned bacteria. The author discussed the significance of the inoculum-size and of competitive and noncompetitive sulphonamide-antagonists in commercial culture-media and the difficulties they raise by the interpretation of the results.
TI  - Properties of R factors from Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - Genetic properties and host ranges of R factors derived from Bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. All of 61 R factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. All of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, T1, T3, T6, T7, W31, and BF-23. They could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. An Rte16, a representative R factor, was incompatible with both RP4 and R40a, which are classified as compatibility groups P and C, respectively. An Rte16 was conjugally transmissible to B. bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but not to Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Treatment of pneumonia and other serious bacterial infections with cephapirin.
AB  - Nineteen patients with pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus  aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. There were three treatment failures. One patient each with pneumonia due to E. coli or S. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. Lobar pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. Five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to S. aureus were cured. All isolates of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and group A Streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. Ninety percent of K. pneumoniae, 85% of Proteus mirabilis, 73% of E. coli, and 30% of Enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. All isolates of Pseudomonas, Serratia and indole-positive Proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [Formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. Serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. The intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. Cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - New antimicrobial nitrofuran, trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-delta2-1,2,4-oxadiazole: antimicrobial efficacy in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
AB  - A new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated SQ 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella flexneri, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Animals infected parenterally with Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Candida albicans, or topically with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. The compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. The chemotherapeutic efficacy of SQ 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by Escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.
TI  - Pulmonary infection due to disruption of the pharyngeal bacterial flora by antibiotics in hamsters.
AB  - An animal model was used to determine the effect of oxacillin on the pharyngeal bacterial flora and the relationship of this flora to pneumonia. The pharyngeal bacterial flora of 68 healthy Golden Syrian hamsters was determined. A quantitative comparison between Streptococci and Escherichia, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter from 70 hamsters was made before and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after oxacillin administration. Lung cultures were positive in 22 of 25 hamsters, yielding K pneumoniae type 1 most frequently. Lung histology from 25 hamsters revealed bronchopneumonia. Intestinal postmortem cultures of treated and untreated animals were similar. The importance of throat cultures in diagnosing pneumonia and the value of the hamster model to study the effect of other antibiotics on the temporary flora are demonstrated.

TI  - Cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1H-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. Enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Cefamandole was very active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of Escherichia coli, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of Proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. A number of Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. Pseudomonas species were resistant. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. Similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. Resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
TI  - Cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: antibacterial spectrum and resistance to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefoxitin, 3-carbamolyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboy xlic acid, was investigated. Activity against gram-positive organisms was less than that of cephalothin and cephloridine. It was highly active against gram-negative bacilli, with activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae equal to that of currently available cephalosporins. In addition, it was active against certain Enterobacter strains, Serratia marcescens, indole-positive Proteae and Herellea. The strains of these latter bacteria were strains susceptible to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were resistant. Changes in pH, inoculum size, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the antibiotic. Cefoxitin was highly resistant to hydrolysis by various types of gram-negative beta-lactamases. The precise role of resistance to beta-lactamase hydrolysis varied from strain to strain. Bacterial resistance to cefoxitin was not necessarily related to hydrolysis of the antibiotic. However, the resistance of cefoxitin to hydrolysis did contribute to its activity. Cefoxitin could function as an inducer of beta-lactamase activity and effectively bound to purified beta-lactamases.

TI  - R-factor-mediated beta-lactamases that hydrolyze oxacillin: evidence for two distinct groups.
AB  - The enzymatic and molecular properties of 14 oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases, all of them R-factor-specified, were studied, and two distinct groups were found. Four of the enzymes had a molecular weight of 24,000, were active against methicillin, and had an electrophoretic mobility of -0.1 cm/h. Eight enzymes had a molecular weight of 45,000, low activity against methicillin, and an electrophoretic mobility of +0.5 cm/h. The remaining two enzymes were similar to those of the second group in being relatively inactive against methicillin, but their molecular weight was lower (42,000) and their electrophoretic mobility was different (-0.1 cm/h). All the enzymes of both groups were sensitive to inhibition by sodium chloride. The two groups were not completely homogeneous in their enzymatic properties; seven possible subtypes could be recognized.

TI  - Effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of Pseudomonas aeruginsoa and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). The lower the pH of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. The antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against P. aeruginosa than against three Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 M to 0.005 M) and at the 3 pH values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). As the pH value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. Antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each pH value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pK(a) values. Lactic acid, with the lowest pK(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro at the pH of the mouse cecum. These results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. Cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Proteus mirabilis. Cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against Escherichia coli and slightly more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive Proteus species. After a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, group A streptococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. There were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. Cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. Its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.

AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.

AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  - One hundred fifty-two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the Kirby-Bauer method. Tobramycin was most active against S. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. All strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and indole-positive Proteus species, and 80% of Enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. Tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against S. aureus, four times as active against P. aeruginosa, slightly more active against E. coli and Enterobacter species, equally active against P. mirabilis, and slightly less active against K. pneumoniae. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of P. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. Tobramycin sterilized cultures of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. Tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 C, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.

TI  - 7-(Alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridinothio)-acetamido) cephalosporanic acid.
AB  - 7-[alpha-(1-Methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as BL-S 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Clinical and in vitro evaluation of cephapirin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cephapirin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and in 27 patients. Cephapirin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against 25 strains each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus; 10 strains each of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas species, and Enterobacter species; and 8 strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All strains of S. aureus and D. pneumoniae and most strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus species were inhibited by concentrations of cephapirin achieved in the serum. Of 27 patients (20 with pneumonia, 2 with S. aureus empyema, and 5 with miscellaneous infections), 25 responded to cephapirin therapy. The only major toxicity thought to be drug-related occurred in a patient who developed reversible bone marrow depression with leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Although cephapirin was painful on intramuscular injection, phlebitis and pain were absent in patients treated intravenously. In a controlled comparison of intravenously administered cephalothin and cephapirin in four additional patients, the latter caused much less pain than the former and caused no phlebitis.

TI  - Effect of mg and ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of Mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) and novobiocin was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis grown in Trypticase Soy Broth or defined synthetic medium. In the presence of EDTA, the activity of coumermycin A(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking Mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against P. mirabilis. Addition of 200 mug of Mg(2+) per ml to the synthetic medium containing EDTA completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by EDTA only against P. aeruginosa. The addition of Mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin A(1) against E. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. K. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of EDTA enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. Subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. In addition, lysis of K. pneumoniae cells was observed.
TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin A1.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. Coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against Staphylococcus aureus. It was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin C antibiotic.
AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.
TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.
TI  - The role of immunity in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis.
AB  - Hematogenous pyelonephritis was produced in rats utilizing multiple strains of Escherichia coli, a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a strain of Proteus mirabilis. Three patterns of hematogenous pyelonephritis occurred which represent an interrelationship between an immune response to the infecting bacteria and the development of obstructive uropathy as a consequence of infection. First, the course of pyelonephritis due to strains of Escherichia coli was acute, self-limited, and associated with the development of circulating agglutinins. Following healing, this pattern of infection was associated with acquired resistance to reinfection with the same bacterial strain. Second, the course of pyelonephritis due to a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae type C was chronic. This infection was not associated with the production of circulating agglutinins against encapsulated strains. Acquired resistance to reinfection by the homotypic strain could not be demonstrated following eradication of infection but was produced by the passive transfer of concentrated antiserum. Third, pyelonephritis due to Proteus mirabilis was associated with circulating agglutinins and resistance to reinfection with the same organism following eradication of infection, yet the course was chronic. The chronicity appeared to be the consequence of obstructive uropathy resulting from calculi which developed during the course of the infection. Resistance to reinfection was demonstrated in infections with strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The resistance is associated with specific immunity as demonstrated by the observation that: (a) it is type-specific, (b) it is of at least 3 months' duration, and (c) it can be passively transferred by means of rabbit antiserum. Since K. pneumoniae failed to evoke capsular antibodies in the rat, resistance to infection with K. pneumoniae was produced only by means of passively transferred concentrated rabbit antiserum and not by prior infection. Immunity can be demonstrated to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis only in the absence of obstructive uropathy.
