TI == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l. reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.
