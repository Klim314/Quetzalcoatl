TI  == carbon-13 labelled biotin--a new probe for the study of enzyme catalyzed carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions.
AB  == [2'-13c]biotin was incorporated into avidin (egg white), glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase (ec 4.1.1.70) from acidaminococcus fermentans and the biotin carrier of transcarboxylase from propionibacterium freudenreichii (ec 2.1.3.1). 13c-nmr measurements showed an upfield shift of the carbonyl carbon of 3.1 and 2.0 ppm for both enzymes, whereas binding to avidin induced no significant change of the chemical shift as compared to free biotin. the data indicate that the enzymes provide an electronic environment for the covalently bound biotin which favours carboxylation. in addition it was demonstrated by nmr-measurements that glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase, from which the hydrophobic carboxy-lyase subunit (beta) was removed, could carboxylate free biotin.

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
