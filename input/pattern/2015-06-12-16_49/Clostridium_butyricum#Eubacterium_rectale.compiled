TI  - Longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. Multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active UC over a period of 1 year. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in UC patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the UC mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. High clinical activity indices (CAI) and sigmoidoscopy scores (SS) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type E Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for Clostridium butyricum, Ruminococcus albus, and Eubacterium rectale. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low CAI. Only E. rectale and Clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. These findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in UC and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.
TI  - Fermentation RS3 derived from sago and rice starch with Clostridium butyricum BCC B2571 or Eubacterium rectale DSM 17629.
AB  - Resistant starch type 3 (RS3) is retrograded starch which is not digested by human starch degrading enzyme, and will thus undergo bacterial degradation in the colon. The main fermentation products are the Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA): acetate, propionate and butyrate. SCFA has significant benefit impact on the metabolism of the host. The objectives of this research were to study the SCFA profile produced by colonic butyrate producing bacteria grown in medium containing RS3. RS3 was made from sago or rice starch treated with amylase, pullulanase and the combination of amylase and pullulanase. Fermentation study was performed by using Clostridium butyricum BCC B2571 or Eubacterium rectale DSM 17629, which has been identified as capable of degradation of starch residue and also regarded as beneficial bacteria. Experimental result revealed that enzyme hydrolysis of retrograded sago or rice starch was beneficial to RS formation. RS3 derived from sago contained higher RS (31-38%) than those derived from rice starch (21-26%). This study indicated that C. butyricum BCC B2571 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1, when the medium was supplemented with RSSA at concentration 1%. In the medium containing similar substrate, E. rectale DSM 17629 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.7 : 1 : 1.2. High levels of acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1.1 was also produced by E. rectale DSM 17629 in medium supplemented with RSSP at concentration 1%. The results showed that both bacteria responded differently to the RS3 supplementation. Such result provided insight into the possibility of designing RS3 as prebiotic with featured regarding SCFA released in the human colon with potential health implication.
