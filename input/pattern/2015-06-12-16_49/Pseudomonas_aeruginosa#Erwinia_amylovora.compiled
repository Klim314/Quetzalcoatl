TI  - Examining Reaction Specificity in PvcB, a Source of Diversity in Isonitrile-Containing Natural Products.
AB  - Many bacteria produce isonitrile-containing natural products that are derived from aromatic amino acids. The synthetic clusters that control biosynthesis most commonly encode two enzymes, designated PvcA and PvcB, as well as additional enzymes that direct synthesis of the natural product. The PvcA enzyme installs the isonitrile moiety at the amino group of either tyrosine or tryptophan, as dictated by the particular pathway. The common pathway intermediate produced by PvcA is directed toward different ultimate products by PvcB, a member of the family of Fe(2+), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. To continue our investigation of the structural and functional properties of the isonitrile biosynthetic pathways, we present here a study of the PvcB homologues from three organisms. Two pathways, derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xenorhabdus nematophila, produce known products. A third PvcB homologue from Erwinia amylovora is part of an uncharacterized pathway. Our results demonstrate the diversity of reactions catalyzed. Although all PvcB enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of the tyrosine isonitrile substrate, the elimination of the hydroxyl in Pseudomonas and Erwinia is driven by deprotonation at Calpha, resulting in the initial production of an unsaturated tyrosine isonitrile product that then cyclizes to a coumarin derivative. PvcB from Xenorhabdus, in contrast, catalyzes the same oxygenation, but loss of the hydroxyl group is accompanied by decarboxylation of the intermediate. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the three reactions and a docking model for the binding of the tyrosine isonitrile substrate in the PvcB active site highlight subtle differences between the PvcB homologues.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa antimetabolite L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid inhibits growth of Erwinia amylovora and acts as a seed germination-arrest factor.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa antimetabolite L-2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-3-butenoic acid (AMB) shares biological activities with 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, a related molecule produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6. We found that culture filtrates of a P. aeruginosa strain overproducing AMB weakly interfered with seed germination of the grassy weed Poa annua and strongly inhibited growth of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the devastating orchard crop disease known as fire blight. AMB was active against a 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine-resistant isolate of E. amylovora, suggesting that the molecular targets of the two oxyvinylglycines in Erwinia do not, or not entirely, overlap. The AMB biosynthesis and transport genes were shown to be organized in two separate transcriptional units, ambA and ambBCDE, which were successfully expressed from IPTG-inducible tac promoters in the heterologous host P. fluorescens CHA0. Engineered AMB production enabled this model biocontrol strain to become inhibitory against E. amylovora and to weakly interfere with the germination of several graminaceous seeds. We conclude that AMB production requires no additional genes besides ambABCDE and we speculate that their expression in marketed fire blight biocontrol strains could potentially contribute to disease control.
TI  - Nocapyrones A-D, gamma-pyrones from a Nocardiopsis strain isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria panicea.
AB  - Four new gamma-pyrones, nocapyrones A-D (1-4), were isolated from an organic extract of the Nocardiopsis strain HB383, which was isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria panicea. These are the first gamma-pyrones reported from a Nocardiopsis strain. The structures were elucidated on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments and supported by HPLC-UV/MS and HRESIMS analyses. The biosynthesis of nocapyrone A was investigated by feeding experiments with (13)C-labeled compounds. In addition, one diketopiperazine, which was only known as a synthetic compound before, was isolated. The bioactivies of 1, 2, and the diketopiperazine were evaluated in a panel of assays.
TI  - Effect of a waaL mutation on lipopolysaccharide composition, oxidative stress survival, and virulence in Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight, is an enterobacterial pathogen of Rosaceous plants including apple and pear. We have been studying the response of E. amylovora to oxidative stress because, during infection, the bacterium elicits an oxidative burst response in host plants. During the screening of a transposon mutant library for hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, we identified a mutant carrying an insertion in waaL, a gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, that was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than the parental wild-type strain. We also confirmed that a waaL mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild-type strain. The E. amylovora waaL mutant was also reduced in virulence, showed a decrease in twitching motility, and was more sensitive to polymyxin B than the wild type. Each of these phenotypes was complemented by the cloned waaL gene. Our results highlight the importance of the lipopolysaccharide layer to virulence in E. amylovora and the unexpected finding of an additional function of lipopolysaccharide in protection from oxidative stress in E. amylovora and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Characterization of serracin P, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, and its activity against Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - Serratia plymithicum J7 culture supernatant displayed activity against many pathogenic strains of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the most serious bacterial disease of apple and pear trees, fire blight, and against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This activity increased significantly upon induction with mitomycin C. A phage-tail-like bacteriocin, named serracin P, was purified from an induced culture supernatant of S. plymithicum J7. It was found to be the only compound involved in the antibacterial activity against sensitive strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the two major subunits (23 and 43 kDa) of serracin P revealed high homology with the Fels-2 prophage of Salmonella enterica, the coliphages P2 and 168, the phiCTX prophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a prophage of Yersinia pestis. This strongly suggests a common ancestry for serracin P and these bacteriophages.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an extracellular protease from Xenorhabdus nematophila involved in insect immunosuppression.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila, a bacterium pathogenic for insects associated with the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, releases high quantities of proteases, which may participate in the virulence against insects. Zymogram assays and cross-reactions of antibodies suggested that two distinct proteases were present. The major one, protease II, was purified and shown to have a molecular mass of 60 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 8.5. Protease II digested the chromogenic substrate N-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-paranitroanilide (pNA) with V(max) and K(m) values of 0.0551 microM/min and 234 microM, respectively, and the substrate DL-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA with V(max) and K(m) values of 0.3830 microM/min and 429 microM, respectively. Protease II activity was inhibited 93% by Pefabloc SC and 45% by chymostatin. The optimum pH for protease II was 7, and the optimum temperature was 23C. Proteolytic activity was reduced by 90% at 60 degrees C for 10 min. Sequence analysis was performed on four internal peptides that resulted from the digestion of protease II. Fragments 29 and 45 are 75 and 68% identical to alkaline metalloproteinase produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fragment 29 is 79% identical to a metalloprotease of Erwinia amylovora and 75% identical to the protease C precursor of Erwinia chrysanthemi. Protease II showed no toxicity to hemocytes but destroyed antibacterial activity on the hemolymph of inoculated insects' larvae and reduced 97% of the cecropin A bacteriolytic activity.
TI  - Assembly and function of type III secretory systems.
AB  - Type III secretion systems allow Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Bordetella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell to inject bacterial proteins across the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic cell membrane to destroy or subvert the target cell. These systems consist of a secretion apparatus, made of approximately 25 proteins, and an array of proteins released by this apparatus. Some of these released proteins are "effectors," which are delivered into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas the others are "translocators," which help the effectors to cross the membrane of the eukaryotic cell. Most of the effectors act on the cytoskeleton or on intracellular-signaling cascades. A protein injected by the enteropathogenic E. coli serves as a membrane receptor for the docking of the bacterium itself at the surface of the cell. Type III secretion systems also occur in plant pathogens where they are involved both in causing disease in susceptible hosts and in eliciting the so-called hypersensitive response in resistant or nonhost plants. They consist of 15-20 Hrp proteins building a secretion apparatus and two groups of effectors: harpins and avirulence proteins. Harpins are presumably secreted in the extracellular compartment, whereas avirulence proteins are thought to be targeted into plant cells. Although a coherent picture is clearly emerging, basic questions remain to be answered. In particular, little is known about how the type III apparatus fits together to deliver proteins in animal cells. It is even more mysterious for plant cells where a thick wall has to be crossed. In spite of these haunting questions, type III secretion appears as a fascinating trans-kingdom communication device.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a protease secreted by Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - A protease with a molecular mass of 48 kDa is secreted by the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora in minimal medium. We characterized this activity as a metalloprotease, since the enzyme was inhibited by EDTA and o -phenanthroline. A gene cluster was determined to encode four genes connected to protease expression, including a structural gene (prtA) and three genes (prtD, prtE, prtF) for secretion of the protease, which are transcribed in the same direction. The organization of the protease gene cluster in E. amylovora is different from that in other Gram-negative bacteria, such as Erwinia chrysanthemi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. On the basis of the conservative motif of metalloproteases, PrtA was identified to be a member of the metzincin subfamily of zinc-binding metalloproteases, and was confirmed to be the 48 kDa protease on gels by sequencing of tryptic peptide fragments derived from the protein. The protease is apparently secreted into the external medium through the type I secretion pathway via PrtD, PrtE and PrtF which share more than 90% identity with the secretion apparatus for lipase of S. marcescens. A protease mutant was created by Tn 5 -insertions, and the mutation localized in the prtD gene. The lack of protease reduced colonization of an E. amylovora secretion mutant labelled with the gene for the green fluorescent protein (gfp) in the parenchyma of apple leaves.
TI  - hrpL activates Erwinia amylovora hrp gene transcription and is a member of the ECF subfamily of sigma factors.
AB  - hrpL of Erwinia amylovora Ea321 encodes a 21.7-kDa regulatory protein, similar to members of the ECF (extra cytoplasmic functions) subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors. hrpL is a single-gene operon in complementation group VI of the E. amylovora hrp gene cluster. Its product is required by Ea321 to elicit the hypersensitive response (HR) and to cause disease. HrpL controls the expression of five independent hrp loci, including hrpN, which encodes harpin, a proteinaceous elicitor of the HR. hrpL is environmentally regulated, and its expression is affected by hrpS, another regulatory gene of the hrp gene cluster of E. amylovora. pCPP1078, a multicopy plasmid carrying hrpL, is able to restore HR-eliciting ability to hrpS mutants. A conserved motif was identified upstream of the hrpI and hrpN operons, which are transcriptionally regulated by hrpL. This conserved motif shares a high degree of similarity with other biochemically defined or putative ECF-dependent promoter sequences, including sequences upstream of Streptomyces coelicolor dagA P2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa algD, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpZ, and P. syringae pv. tomato avrD. In spite of the similarity between the hrpL genes of E. amylovora and P. syringae 61, no functional cross-complementation was observed.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Numerical survey of some bacterial taxa.
AB  - Focht, D. D. (Iowa State University, Ames), and W. R. Lockhart. Numerical survey  of some bacterial taxa. J. Bacteriol. 90:1314-1319. 1965.-A numerical analysis was made of 77 properties of each of 43 bacterial strains, representing 25 genera from 8 families in the orders Eubacteriales and Pseudomonadales. Four major groups were found, related to one another at approximately the same level of similarity: (1) a large cluster containing the subgroups (1a) Athiorhodaceae-Spirillaceae, (1b) Xanthomonas, and (1c) "inactive" Micrococcaceae-Achromobacteraceae; (2) a cluster containing the "active" Micrococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae; (3) the enterobacteria; and (4) Aeromonas. There was a sharp distinction between the branches of groups 1a, 1c, and 2. The composition of groups was essentially the same whether or not fermentation of carbohydrates (28 characters) was included in the analysis. Several individual strains, notably, Bacillus subtilis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Erwinia amylovora, were related to none of the groups, and others (two species of Proteus, Flavobacterium devorans, and Lactobacillus casei) showed only minimal quantitative relationships with their groups. These results suggest that there may be significant variation in levels of similarity within microbial groups presently accorded equivalent taxonomic rank, and that some present distinctions among taxa, particularly at the generic level, cannot be confirmed on the basis of overall similarity.
