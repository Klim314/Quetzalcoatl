TI  == staphylococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the staphylococcus carnosus ptsi gene and expression and complementation studies of the gene product.
AB  == a digoxigenin-labeled dna probe that was complementary to the gene ptsh and the beginning of the gene ptsi was used to clone a 3.2-kb hincii-bamhi restriction fragment containing the complete ptsi gene of staphylococcus carnosus. the restriction fragment was cloned in the antisense orientation to the lac promoter  in the low-copy-number vector psu18. the nucleotide sequences of the ptsi gene, which encodes enzyme i (ec 2.7.3.9), and the corresponding flanking regions were  determined. the primary translation product, derived from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 574 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 63,369. amino acid sequence comparison showed 47% similarity to enzyme i of escherichia coli and 37% similarity to the enzyme i domain of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein of rhodobacter capsulatus. the histidinyl residue at position 191 could be identified as the probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation site of enzyme i of s. carnosus because of sequence homologies with the peptide sequences of enzyme i-active sites of enterococcus faecalis and  lactococcus lactis. several in vivo and in vitro complementation studies with the enzyme i ptsi genes of s. carnosus and the e. coli ptsi mutant jlt2 were carried  out. the generation times and interaction between enzyme i with histidine-containing protein from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were measured in a phosphoryl group transfer test.
