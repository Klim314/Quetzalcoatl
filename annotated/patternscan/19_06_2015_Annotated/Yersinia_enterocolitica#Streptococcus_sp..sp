TI  == urticaria and bacterial infections.
AB  == the association between urticaria and infectious diseases has been discussed for  >100 years. however, a causal relationship with underlying or precipitating infection is difficult to establish. the purpose of this work was to perform a systematic analysis of the published cases of urticaria associated with bacterial infections. we give an umbrella breakdown of up-to-date systematic reviews and other important publications on the complex association of urticaria and bacterial infections. we did a medline search, for english language articles published until january 2014, using the key words "urticaria" and "bacteria/bacterial disease"; a second analysis was performed in groups of bacteria and using each germ name as a key word. many bacterial infections have been associated with urticaria manifestation, such as helicobacter pylori, streptococcus, staphylococcus, mycoplasma pneumonia, salmonella, brucella, mycobacterium leprae, borrelia, chlamydia pneumonia, and yersinia enterocolitica. in some cases the skin manifestations, described as urticaria, could be caused by the presence of the microorganism in the skin, or for the action of their toxins, or to the complement activation mediated by circulating immune complexes. although only a weak association with urticaria of unclear pathogenesis exists, clinicians should consider these bacterial agents in the workup of the patients with urticaria. the eradication of the infection could, in fact, lead to the resolution of urticaria. prospective studies and well-structured research are obviously needed to better clarify the real role of bacteria in the pathogenesis  of urticaria and their relative prevalence.

TI  == preparation and antimicrobial action of three tryptic digested functional molecules of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an 80 kda bilobal, iron binding glycoprotein which is primarily antimicrobial in nature. the hydrolysis of lactoferrin by various proteases in the gut produces several functional fragments of lactoferrin which have varying molecular sizes and properties. here, bovine lactoferrin has been hydrolyzed by trypsin, the major enzyme present in the gut, to produce three functional molecules of sizes approximately 21 kda, 38 kda and 45 kda. the molecules have been purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and identified using n-terminal sequencing, which reveals that while the 21 kda molecule corresponds to the n2 domain (21lf), the 38 kda represents the whole c-lobe (38lf) and the 45 kda is a portion of n1 domain of n-lobe attached to the c-lobe  (45lf). the iron binding and release properties of 21lf, 38lf and 45lf have been  studied and compared. the sequence and structure analysis of the portions of the  excision sites of lf from various species have been done. the antibacterial properties of these three molecules against bacterial strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes were investigated. the antifungal action of the molecules was also evaluated against candida albicans. this is the first report on the antimicrobial actions of the trypsin cleaved functional molecules of lactoferrin from any species.

TI  == technological and probiotic potential of bgra43 a natural isolate of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 is a human intestinal isolate showing antimicrobial activity, amongst others, against yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, shigella flexneri, and streptococcus pneumoniae. bgra43 produces prth proteinase with proteolytic activity on both casein and beta-lactoglobulin (blg). bgra43 is able to reduce the allergenicity of blg. bioactive peptides released in bgra43 fermented milk are potent modulators of innate immunity by modulating the  production of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha. bgra43 is able to survive in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. the growth of bgra43 in milk results in a fast acidification lowering the milk ph to 4.53 generating mild, homogeneous, and viscous yogurt-like product. the strain bgra43 grows suitably in pure cow or goat's milk as well as in milk containing inulin or nutrim even when they are used as the sole carbon source. it is suggested that strain bgra43 could be used as a single-strain culture for the preparation of yogurt-like products from bovine or caprine milk. overall, l. helveticus bgra43 could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate with appropriate technological properties attractive for the dairy industry.

TI  == use of a dna microarray for detection and identification of bacterial pathogens associated with fishery products.
AB  == we established a microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of  diverse putative pathogens often associated with fishery products by targeting specific genes of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio  vulnificus, and yersinia enterocolitica and the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) region of proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. the microarray contained 26 specific probes and was tested against a total of 123 target bacterial strains that included 55 representative strains, 68 clinical isolates, and 45 strains of other bacterial species that belonged to 8 genera and 34 species, and it was shown to be specific and reproducible. a detection sensitivity of 10 ng dna or 10 cfu/ml for pure cultures of each target organism demonstrated that the assay was highly sensitive and reproducible. mock and real  fishery product samples were tested by the microarray, and the accuracy was 100%. the dna microarray method described in this communication is specific, sensitive, and reliable and has several advantages over traditional methods of bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination assays.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  == marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. there is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. but problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes amphiprion sebae and a. ocellaris were  identified as aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sp., e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp., streptococcus sp., vibrio cholerae, v. alginolyticus, v. parahaemolyticus and yersinia enterocolitica. ethanol and methanol extracts were  highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. the present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == sideromycins: tools and antibiotics.
AB  == sideromycins are antibiotics covalently linked to siderophores. they are actively transported into gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. energy-coupled transport across the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane strongly increases their antibiotic efficiency; their minimal inhibitory concentration is  at least 100-fold lower than that of antibiotics that enter cells by diffusion. this is particularly relevant for gram-negative bacteria because the outer membrane, which usually forms a permeability barrier, in this case actively contributes to the uptake of sideromycins. sideromycin-resistant mutants can be used to identify siderophore transport systems since the mutations are usually in transport genes. two sideromycins, albomycin and salmycin, are discussed here. albomycin, a derivative of ferrichrome with a bound thioribosyl-pyrimidine moiety, inhibts seryl-t-rna synthetase. salmycin, a ferrioxamine derivative with  a bound aminodisaccharide, presumably inhibts protein synthesis. crystal structures of albomycin bound to the outer membrane transporter fhua and the periplasmic binding protein fhud have been determined. albomycin and salmycin have been used to characterize the transport systems of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae and of staphylococcus aureus, respectively. the in vivo  efficacy of albomycin and salmycin has been examined in a mouse model using yersinia enterocolitica, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus infections. albomycin is effective in clearing infections, whereas salmycin is too unstable to lead to a large reduction in bacterial numbers. the recovery rate of albomycin-resistant mutants is lower than that of the wild-type, which suggests a reduced fitness of  the mutants. albomycin could be a useful antibiotic provided sufficient quantities can be isolated from streptomycetes or synthesized chemically.

TI  == recombining population structure of plesiomonas shigelloides (enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa,  leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains  from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position  of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == using standard microbiological procedures, bacteria that are potentially pathogenic to humans were isolated from 150 houseflies collected in the libyan city of misurata (50 flies each from the central hospital, streets and abattoir). salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica and edwardsiella tarda were isolated from flies collected on the streets and in the abattoir but not from those collected in the hospital. shigella sonnei was detected in just one fly, which was collected in the abattoir. of the flies collected in the hospital, streets and abattor, 42%, 42% and 32% were positive for escherichia coli, 70%, 50% and 62% for klebsiella spp., 2%, 20% and 10% for aeromonas spp., 96%, 36% and 34% for pseudomonas spp., 20%, 12% and 16% for staphylococcus spp., and 24%, 22% and 18%  for streptococcus spp., respectively. when the antibiotic susceptibilities of the fly isolates were investigated, the enterobacteria isolated from the houseflies collected in the hospital were found to be resistant to significantly more of the commonly used antibiotics that were tested than the enterobacteria isolated from  the flies caught in the streets or abattoir. whatever the source of the flies from which they were collected, the pseudomonas isolates frequently showed resistance to multiple antibiotics, with >50% each being resistant to at least 10 antimicrobial agents. two isolates of sta. aureus (both from flies collected in the hospital) were resistant to methicillin. the present study supports the belief that the housefly is a potential vector of multiple-antibiotic-resistant,  pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant sta. aureus, in the hospital environment. given their mobility, it seems likely that houseflies carry such pathogens from hospitals to surrounding communities, and vice versa.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  == sickle cell anaemia (sca) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia  leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus b19 and hepatitis a, b and c viruses. penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related  morbidity and mortality significantly in children with sca. children <3 years of  age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. adherence to the penicillin  prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with sca who are >5 years of age. for children with sca who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. the administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact  on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with sca. the administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7)  has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. other vaccines used prophylactically in children with sca include hepatitis a and b, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. the immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with sca. ceftriaxone and  cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in sca associated with s. pneumoniae, haemophilus and salmonella spp. infection with yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. the  prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in sca is unknown. effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. the judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the long term sequelae associated with infections in children with sca can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.

TI  == development of a brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and pcr which distinguishes b. suis from brucella abortus.
AB  == a genomic library was prepared from brucella suis dna (mboi digested) and cloned  into the bamhi site of puc18. colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified b. suis dna labelled with alpha 32p was carried out to identify colonies of interest. about 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole b. suis genomic dna as a probe, were selected. because of the high degree of dna homology between b. suis and brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. of seven fragments selected to probe whole b. suis, b. abortus, and yersinia enterocolitica dna, one was found to hybridise with b. suis only. the probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. after optimisation of the pcr, a product of 420bp was obtained with b. suis template dna and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with b. abortus template dna. this is the first reported pcr of the brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between b. suis and b. abortus. no band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify e. coli,  y. enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, or serratia marcescens template dna.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus gordonii chromosomal region immediately downstream of the glucosyltransferase gene.
AB  == the streptococcus gordonii glucosyltransferase gene, gtfg, is positively regulated by the upstream determinant rgg. in the present study, two orfs, transcribed on the opposite dna strand, were identified immediately downstream of gtfg. the first, designated dsg, shares a convergent putative transcriptional terminator with gtfg, and encodes a predicted 46 kda transmembrane protein similar to the yersinia enterocolitica trsa involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. insertional inactivation of dsg resulted in only approximately approximately 60% of the parental level of glucosyltransferase activity. the 870  bp gene 5' to dsg is similar to the gtfg regulatory determinant. designated rggd, this rgg-like determinant downstream of gtfg encodes a putative 33.6 kda cytoplasmic protein. despite their sequence similarity, the functions of rgg and  rggd appear specific. strains in which rggd was insertionally inactivated and strains containing plasmid-borne rggd had parental levels of glucosyltransferase  activity. northern blot hybridization analyses showed approximately 1.3 kb dsg-specific and approximately 1.0 kb rggd-specific mrna transcripts associated with this region; no polycistronic transcript was observed. although rgg-like gene products have been demonstrated to function as positive transcriptional regulators of adjacent genes in several streptococcal species, northern blot analysis suggested that rggd did not influence the transcription of dsg or the divergent downstream ylbn-like determinant under the conditions in the present study. comparison of this s. gordonii chromosome region to other streptococcal genomes, which do not contain the rgg/rggd-flanked region involved in glucan synthesis, raised intriguing possibilities about the origins of this chromosomal  region, and also suggested that rggd might regulate a distally located gene.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == infections in e-beta thalassemia.
AB  == infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially e-beta thalassemia. the spectrum of infections in e-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (dfo) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. prospective studies in thailand indicate that patients with e-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. the former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. responsible organisms were escherichia coli (26%), klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), salmonella (15%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). other organisms included pseudomonas, staphylococci, burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and aeromonas. patients undergoing dfo therapy are at risk for y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as  septicemia. recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. the causative organism, pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom stramenopila, and in the class oomycetes. the mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment  has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. the predisposing factors of  infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. general management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral  penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.

TI  == gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. it has enhanced activity against gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antigram-negative activity. for example, the mic(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), legionella species, mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), neisseria species, most enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella species, vibrio species and yersinia enterocolitica. for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia species, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, the mic(90) are elevated. gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections.  the side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.

TI  == host recognition and target differentiation by factor h, a regulator of the alternative pathway of complement.
AB  == factor h is responsible for recognition of host cells and tissues and mediates discrimination among microbial pathogens during activation of the alternative pathway of complement (ap). its unique structure of 20 scr domains arranged in a  flexible chain permits a variety of functional sites to interact with complement  proteins and surface markers in a biological example of single-molecule combinatorial chemistry. in addition to the complement regulatory site located in the n-terminal four scr domains, two other sites bind complement protein c3b and  three sites appear to recognize a variety of polyanions that serve as host markers. recent studies indicate that cooperativity among several c3b- and polyanion-binding sites influences the biological functions of factor h and that  the degree of influence of each site varies on different cells. the engagement of one or more of the host marker recognition sites enables factor h to control activation of the ap. the absence of host-like markers allows ap activation, but  many common pathogens have developed receptors for factor h or mimics of host markers of varying degrees of authenticity allowing them to escape detection by this innate defense system. organisms using one or more of these evasive techniques include neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus pyogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, trypanosoma cruzi, and the hiv virus.

TI  == insertion of a yop translocation pore into the macrophage plasma membrane by yersinia enterocolitica: requirement for translocators yopb and yopd, but not lcrg.
AB  == the yersinia survival strategy is based on its ability to inject effector yops into the cytosol of host cells. translocation of these effectors across the eukaryotic cell membrane requires yopb, yopd and lcrg, but the mechanism is unclear. an effector polymutant of y. pseudotuberculosis has a yopb-dependent contact haemolytic activity, indicating that yopb participates in the formation of a pore in the cell membrane. here, we have investigated the formation of such  a pore in the plasma membrane of macrophages. infection of pu5-1.8 macrophages with an effector polymutant y. enterocolitica led to complete flattening of the cells, similar to treatment with the pore-forming streptolysin o from streptococcus pyogenes. upon infection, cells released the low-molecular-weight marker bcecf (623 da) but not the high-molecular-weight lactate dehydrogenase, indicating that there was no membrane lysis but, rather, insertion of a pore of small size into the macrophage plasma membrane. permeation to lucifer yellow ch (443 da) but not to texas red-x phalloidin (1490 da) supported this hypothesis. all these events were found to be dependent not only on translocator yopb as expected but also on yopd, which was required equally. in contrast, lcrg was not  necessary. consistently, lysis of sheep erythrocytes was also dependent on yopb and yopd, but not on lcrg.

AB  == it has been suggested that the 65 kda heat-shock protein (hsp) of streptococcus in recurrent aphthae within the oral cavity may be involved in the uveoretinitis  of behcet's disease, possibly through sensitization of the immune system. to investigate this possibility, we examined serum antibody titers for various members of the 60 kda family of hsps and their implications with regard to a role for hsp60s in behcet's disease. we isolated hsp60 of streptococcus pyogenes from  the margin of oral aphthae in one behcet's disease patient with severe uveoretinitis and the hsp60s of yersinia enterocolitica, retinoblastoma cell line clone y79, and bovine retinal extract and investigated the reaction of each of these hsp60s with 100-fold diluted serum samples from 20 behcet's disease patients using anti-hsp60 antibody titers determined by elisa. the anti- streptococcus hsp60 antibody and anti-retinal hsp60 antibody titers of the 100-fold diluted serum samples from the behcet's disease patients were both significantly higher than those of similarly diluted serum samples from healthy donors. the results of the elisa antibody titer assay showed that, although the various hsp60s share a common basic antigenicity, they differed in reactivity to  the anti-hsp60 antibodies in the sera of the behcet's disease patients. the results indicate that subtle but significant differences exist in the antigenicity of the various hsp60s tested, all of which share a common basic antigenicity and are of approximately the same molecular weight, and suggest that an immuno-cross-reaction between retinal and streptococcal hsps and a related autoimmune response may be involved in the development of behcet's disease.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to  the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt  starters.

TI  == analysis of the icsba locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == by deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsa gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glcnac to hep-ii in the inner core of meningococcal lps. this gene has homology to several lps glycosyltransferases, notably to rfak from salmonella typhimurium and bplh from bordetella pertussis, both of which encode glcnac transferases. directly upstream of icsa is an orf showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein hi0653 from the haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from streptococcus thermophilus and yersinia enterocolitica. insertional inactivation  of this orf resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated lps. we have named  this new lps-involved gene icsb. differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies  and in mobility on tricine-sds-page showed that lps from icsa and icsb mutants is similar but not identical. on the basis of these results, we postulated that the  new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glc to hep-i. structural analysis of purified mutant lps by electrospray mass spectrometry was  used to verify this hypothesis. the composition determined for icsa and icsb is lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea and lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea-glcnac, respectively. the icsa and icsb genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2 basal structure, with icsa first adding glcnac to hep-ii and icsb subsequently adding glc to hep-i. only then is completion of the lacto-n-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the igta-e genes.

AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == expression of mhc class ii molecules on human monocytes is regulated independently from each other after phagocytosis of bacteria.
AB  == reactive arthritis is usually self-limiting polyarthritis which develops in hla-b27 positive individuals after certain gastrointestinal or urogenital infections. the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis is unknown but t cells seem to have a crucial role. most of the antigen-specific t cells isolated from the synovial fluid have been mhc class ii restricted. the role of antigen presentation in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis has been studied relatively little. in this work the authors studied the effect of arthritis-triggering bacterium (yersinia enterocolitica o:3) on the expression of mhc class ii molecules on human monocytes and found that the expression of different mhc class ii molecules was regulated independently from each other in half of the individuals after certain incubation periods. in these cases the expression of hla-dp was parallel to the expression of hla-dq, while hla-dr expression went to the opposite direction or did not change at all. no difference between hla-b27 negative and hla-b27 positive healthy individuals was seen. the authors conclude that independent regulation of the expression of different mhc class ii antigens on antigen-presenting cells is a more common phenomenon than usually thought.

AB  == the production of antibodies to klebsiella capsular polysaccharides was measured  in sera from either hla-b27-positive (hla-b27+) or hla-b27-negative (hla-b27-) patients with classical ankylosing spondylitis (n = 54). these sera were compared with sera from patients with various rheumatic diseases (n = 82) and hla-b27+ or  hla-b27- healthy individuals (n = 85). all sera were analyzed by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to each of the 77 klebsiella serotypes. the sera from hla-b27+ patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed a significantly higher antibody frequency to the capsular types k26, k36, and k50 than the sera from hla-b27- ankylosing spondylitis patients, patients with psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or reactive arthritis after yersinia enterocolitica infection, or healthy controls (p < 0.02). the antibodies were of the immunoglobulin g type. no significant antibody response to the other 74 klebsiella serotypes, noncapsulated mutants of  k26, k36, and k50, or preparations of citrobacter, serratia, hafnia, or morganella spp. or streptococcus pneumoniae could be detected. the results might  suggest a specific association between these capsular types and hla-b27+ ankylosing spondylitis and might imply their predominance in this disease.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == use of recombinant interleukin-2 to enhance adoptive transfer of resistance to listeria monocytogenes infection.
AB  == in vitro incubation of listeria-immune spleen cells (lisc) with recombinant interleukin-2 (ril-2) for at least 3 days increased their ability to transfer antilisteria resistance to recipient mice. this effect was blocked by the in vitro addition of transforming growth factor beta 1. the level of protection afforded by the transfer of ril-2-incubated lisc was further elevated by the in vivo administration of ril-2 at a dose that by itself did not significantly increase antilisteria resistance. the antilisteria resistance of recipient mice remained elevated for approximately 7 days and then rapidly declined to undetectable levels by 10 days. after cell transfer, recipient mice were protected against challenge with listeria monocytogenes but not salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, or streptococcus pyogenes. flow cytometric  analyses revealed an increase in the percentages of cd8+, nk+, and gamma delta t  cell receptor+ cells but no change in the percentage of cd4+ cells as a result of lisc coculturing with ril-2. in vitro depletion of cd4+ cells just prior to transfer had no significant effect on the adoptive transfer of resistance; depletion of cd8+ cells reduced the level of resistance by approximately 25%. combined depletion of thy-1.2+, cd4+, and cd8+ cells just prior to adoptive transfer diminished the level of protection in the spleens but not the livers of  recipient mice. these data suggest that ril-2 can be used to augment adoptive immunotherapy for bacterial infection in a manner similar to adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer patients. although the protective cell population was not definitively identified, it appeared to be independent of cd4+ cells and  only partly dependent on cd8+ cells.

AB  == the new oral cephalosporins cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten demonstrate enhanced activity against enterobacteriaceae susceptible to the established compounds as well (e.g. cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefadroxil). in  addition, cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten include in their spectrum species hitherto resistant to oral cephalosporins (proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., yersinia enterocolitica). besides, the majority of these compounds demonstrate relevant activity (mic50 equal to or below 2 mg/l) against enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii. ceftibuten is the most potent oral cephalosporin against most of the enterobacteriaceae. non-fermentative bacilli (acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp.) remain completely resistant to oral cephalosporins (except some acinetobacter species against cefdinir and pseudomonas cepacia against ceftibuten). antistaphylococcal activity for oral cephalosporins is highest for cefdinir followed by bay 3522, cefprozil, cefuroxime and cefpodoxime. loracarbef, cefaclor and cefadroxil are about equally active, while the other compounds are only weakly active (cefixime) or inactive (cefetamet, ceftibuten). enterococci are insensitive to new generation oral cephalosporins as they have been to established compounds. the most active oral cephalosporins against hemolytic streptococci are cefdinir and cefprozil. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  milleri and streptococcus mitior are most susceptible to cefpodoxime, cefdinir, cefuroxime and bay 3522. penicillin resistant pneumococci have to be regarded as  resistant to all oral cephalosporins. fastidious pathogens like haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae are more susceptible to cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten than to the other oral  cephalosporins. the activity of oral cephalosporins is only weak against listeria spp., helicobacter pylori and anaerobic pathogens (except bay 3522). bordetella pertussis remains resistant to all absorbable cephalosporins. progress in antibacterial activity of oral cephalosporins was mainly achieved by cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten against enterobacteriaceae and the fastidious pathogens and against staphylococci and the nonenterococcal streptococci by cefdinir, bay 3522, cefprozil and cefpodoxime.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups a and b, and  streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 microgram/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it inhibited campylobacter spp. and pasteurella multocida, and had an mic50 of 8 micrograms/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp. and yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == [course of the diffusion of cefotiam in infected ascitic fluid].
AB  == the cefotiam (cft) penetration in infected ascitic fluid was investigated in 12 cirrhotic patients. cft (1 g every 8 h) was given intravenously and measured by hplc in plasmatic and ascitic samples. the mean ascitic concentrations (+/- sem), 1 h, 3 h and 8 h after the first injection (j1) were 14.6 +/- 4.6, 11.8 +/- 3 and 8.4 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml respectively. these values were 38, 62 and 88% of the corresponding mean plasmatic concentrations and higher than the mic's for the organisms most commonly involved. the mean plasmatic and ascitic concentrations,  a few days later (4.5 or 6 days) (jn) were not significantly different from the corresponding values at j1. a significant decrease of polymorphonuclear cell count was observed between j1 and jn. these results suggest that cft diffusion into ascitic fluid is independent of inflammation and cft is an adequate antibiotic in cirrhotic patients with infected ascitic fluid.

TI  == pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  == one-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. the occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. salmonella and shigella spp. or giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. this figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. cultures from the nose and throat revealed streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis or group a, c and g streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. neither clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.

TI  == potent antagonism of escherichia coli, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium,  and enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == communicable disease associated with milk and dairy products in england and wales: 1983-1984.
AB  == during the period 1983-1984 32 outbreaks of disease (ii in 1983 and 21 in 1984) associated with consumption of milk and dairy products and affecting at least 714 people were reported from england and wales. twenty-seven of the outbreaks were attributed to raw milk, two to contaminated pasteurised milk and one each to cheese, cream and ice-cream. twenty-two were due to salmonellas, seven to campylobacters and one each to staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus zooepidemicus. two sporadic cases of corynebacterium ulcerans infection associated with raw milk were also reported. there were eight deaths, all associated with the s. zooepidemicus outbreak. the continuing occurrence of milk-borne outbreaks, and an increasing number of incidents affecting rural communities, emphasises the urgent need for enforcing pasteurisation of milk and  dairy products in england and wales.

TI  == pathogenesis of catheter sepsis: a prospective study with quantitative and semiquantitative cultures of catheter hub and segments.
AB  == our purpose was to study prospectively the causes, routes of infection, and frequency of catheter-related sepsis in patients on total parenteral nutrition. from january 1981 to january 1984, cultures of 135 subclavian catheters from 135  adult patients were done by quantitative and semiquantitative methods. twenty patients (14.8%) had catheter-related sepsis. fourteen episodes (70%) stemmed from an colonized hub. skin infection (staphylococcus aureus, 2 cases), total parenteral nutrition mixture contamination (enterobacter cloacae, 2 cases), and hematogenous seeding of the catheter tip (yersinia enterocolitica, 1 case, and streptococcus faecalis, 1 case) accounted for the remaining six septic episodes.  the catheter hub is, in our experience, the most common site of origin of organisms causing catheter tip infection and bacteremia.

TI  == lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in b27-associated arthropathies.
AB  == lymphocyte transformation tests to yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/reiter's disease and controls. ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/reiter's to yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to s. faecalis (p = 0.008). it appears, therefore, that within the b27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/reiter's disease.

TI  == glomerular disease in adults in the savannah region of nigeria--clinical and pathological features.
AB  == in a consecutive series of 134 adult patients with glomerular disease, 82.7% showed proliferative glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy; 45% of the cases were asymptomatic. nephrotic syndrome in adults in northern nigeria should respond to  immunosuppressive therapy only rarely. there was no evidence to implicate plasmodium malariae as the cause of glomerular disease in adults in the savannah  belt in nigeria. the roles of hepatitis b virus and yersinia enterocolitica were  discussed and require further serological investigations. o-serotype 8 yersiniosis is reported outside the usa for the first time and is possibly nephritogenic. hepatosplenomegalic schistosomiasis is also reported for the first time in africa south of the sahara. the role of the eradication of infections due to the streptococcus, hepatitis b virus, p. malariae, schistosomes and y. enterocolitica in the reduction of glomerular disease is discussed.

TI  == comparative susceptibility of yersinia enterocolitica, eikenella corrodens, and penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam and alternative antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 14 strains of yersinia enterocolitica, 28 strains of eikenella corrodens, 10 strains of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and 10 strains of penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae. y. enterocolitica was found to be susceptible to the aminoglycosides tested and to chloramphenicol, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime but resistant to ampicillin and variably susceptible to carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. on a weight basis, cefotaxime and moxalactam were the most active agents against e. corrodens. most strains of e. corrodens were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested: gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae was most susceptible  to cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefotaxime was consistently active against all tested strains of y. enterocolitica, e. corrodens, and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, three unusual but clinically significant pathogens.

TI  == microbiological studies on hamburgers.
AB  == one hundred and eighty-two raw, 112 pre-cooked and 750 cooked hamburgers composed mainly of beef or beef and pork were subjected to microbiological examination.raw hamburgers gave total bacterial counts from 10(6) to 10(8) per g, counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(4) to 10(6) per g, of escherichia coli from 10(3) to 10(5), of group d streptococci from 10(2) to 10(4), of staphylococcus aureus from 3 to 10(2) and of clostridium perfringens less than 10 bacteria per g. of the samples, 32% contained salmonellas; the highest most probable number was 10(2) per g but most estimates were below 1 per g. corresponding figures for the pre-cooked samples were 2-3 log cycles lower, and only one sample contained salmonella. yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any raw or pre-cooked sample.three hundred and ninety-five of the cooked hamburgers were prepared by grilling raw hamburgers for between 2 and 5.5 min. these gave total bacterial counts from 10(5) to 10(7) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(2) to  10(5) per g. of the samples, 9.4% contained salmonellas, always in numbers below  1 per g. the remaining 355 cooked hamburgers were prepared from samples pre-cooked for 10 min at 80 degrees c. some were grilled and some fat fried. the  total bacterial counts were from 10(3) to 10(5) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae below 10(2) per g. salmonellae, again in small numbers only, were recovered from 3.5% of samples.when hamburgers were artificially contaminated with salmonella typhimurium it took 5.5 min on a commercial grill, 2.25 min frying in a frying pan and 1.75 min on a household grill to reliably reduce the salmonella count one hundredfold. this means that at many vending places hamburgers are often cooked for too short a time.d-values were determined  for s. typhimurium in hamburger meat at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 degrees c, these values were 7.1, 5.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 min respectively. it can be concluded that the heating action in the centre of the hamburgers will take place more slowly than in the hamburger as a whole, and that the time between cooking and consumption is very important in reducing the microbial load to acceptable levels.pre-cooking (10 min at 80 degrees c in a water bath) gives a reduction in  the numbers of salmonella of about 4 x 10(3), after which cooking gives a further reduction as mentioned above.

TI  == the prevalence of antibodies to hemolytic streptococci and yersinia enterocolitica in danish school children and among hospitalized patients.
AB  == serological investigations in infections caused by hemolytic streptococci and by  yersinia enterocolitica (y. ent.) can be diagnostically decisive. here are presented the results of 2 extensive serologic investigations of a population of  school children (n = 929) and of hospitalized patients (n = 2121). it is shown that only very high titers of streptococcal antibodies were of diagnostic value in single samples as most other titers had the same distribution and frequency in the healthy population. titers of antibodies to y. ent. were elevated 5 times more often in the hospital patients than in the healthy population. antibodies to y. ent. were approximately at the same level in all age groups in contrast to the streptococcal antibodies, which decreased with age. in about 4% of the 2121 patients investigated elevated antibody titers to both bacteria were found simultaneously. the differential diagnosis may be difficult in such cases especially if they exhibit symptoms of rheumatic fever.
