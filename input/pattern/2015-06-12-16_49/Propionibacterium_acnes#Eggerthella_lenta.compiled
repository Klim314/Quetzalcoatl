TI  - Anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Owing to the difficulties in identifying anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli in clinical microbiology laboratories, the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of many of these bacteria have been poorly understood. The application of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in characterizing bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating Gram-positive bacilli during a 4-year period is described. The first case of Olsenella uli bacteraemia, in a patient with acute cholangitis, is also reported. Among 165 blood culture isolates of anaerobic, Gram-positive bacilli, 75 were identified as Propionibacterium acnes by phenotypic tests and 21 as members of other anaerobic, non-sporulating Gram-positive bacilli by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of these 96 isolates, 16 (17 %) were associated with cases of clinically significant bacteraemia, among which 10 (63 %) were caused by Eggerthella, four (25 %) by Lactobacillus and one (6 %) by each of Eubacterium tenue and O. uli. Five of the 10 Eggerthella isolates were Eggerthella lenta, whereas the other five belonged to two novel Eggerthella species, with Eggerthella hongkongensis being almost as prevalent as Eggerthella lenta. Underlying disease in the gastrointestinal tract, isolation of Eggerthella and Lactobacillus, and monomicrobial bacteraemia were associated with clinically significant bacteraemia, whereas isolation of P. acnes and polymicrobial bacteraemia were associated with pseudobacteraemia. Most patients with clinically significant bacteraemia had underlying diseases, with diseases in the gastrointestinal tract being most common. The overall mortality rate was 31 %. Immunocompromised patients with clinically significant bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating, Gram-positive bacilli other than P. acnes should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. The unexpected frequency of isolation of Eggerthella from blood cultures and its association with clinically significant disease suggest that this genus is probably of high pathogenicity. Further studies to look for specific virulence factors are warranted.
TI  - Multiple bacteria in aortic aneurysms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. The tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Anaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). All bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. Five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). Among anaerobes found were Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Eggerthella lenta. Coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. Bacteria were found in 20 of the 28 samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: Multiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. It is not clear whether the bacteria contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.
