in vitro susceptibilities of aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli to hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and 14 other antimicrobials.
the comparative in vitro activity of the ketolide hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and those of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin compounds (erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, lincomycin, pristinamycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin) as well as those of benzylpenicillin, doxycycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin, levofloxacin, and rifapentine against 247 aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli were determined by an agar dilution method. the ketolide was active against most organisms tested except corynebacterium striatum, coryneform cdc group 12, and oerskovia spp. the frequency of resistance to erythromycin and other macrolides as well as that to lincomycin was high. pristinamycin and, to a lesser extent, quinupristin-dalfopristin were very active, but resistance to these agents was present in some strains of rhodococcus equi, listeria spp., c. striatum, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and oerskovia spp. hmr 3647 was very active against all erythromycin-sensitive and many erythromycin-nonsusceptible strains, especially corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium. in vitro resistance to benzylpenicillin was common, but doxycycline, vancomycin, and teicoplanin were very active against most organisms tested except e. rhusiopathiae, against which glycopeptide antibiotics were not active. the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was remarkable, but resistance to this agent was common for c. amycolatum, corynebacterium urealyticum, c. jeikeium, and oerskovia spp. strains. rifapentine was also very active in vitro against many organisms, but resistance to this agent was always present in e. rhusiopathiae and was very common in c. striatum and c. urealyticum.
