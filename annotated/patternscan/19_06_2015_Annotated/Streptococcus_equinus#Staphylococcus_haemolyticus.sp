TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children.
AB  == infectious endocarditis (ie) represents a rare pathology in children, but with lethal potential. the goal of the therapy is fast and total eradication of the infection. aims: to study particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children. material and methods: children with infectious endocarditis hospitalized between january 2007 - february 2012 in the  cardiology department of the ,,sfanta maria" children emergency hospital of lasi  have been included in the study. results: the patients are aged between 23 days and 16 years, the average age being 4 years old. at approximately 88% of the patients (14 cases), the endocardial damage appeared in the pre-existent valvular lesions, specially mitral and aortal. as associated congenital malformations, the patients prevailingly presented ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, arterial canal persistence, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta. blood cultures were collected and the most frequent identified etiological agents were: staphylococcus coagulase-positive, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus speciae coagulase-negative, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus bovis, escherichia coli, for which the antibiogram showed sensitivity for beta-lactam, cephalosporins, glycopeptides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, quinolone, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and thus specific treatment was set up according to the antibiogram. conclusions: the infectious endocarditis is a serious disease that affects young age too, leading towards exitus in some cases. diagnostic imaging and early blood cultures are of relevance in order to intervene promptly. the treatment must be targeted and applied as fast as possible.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibodies to bacterial vaccines demonstrating specificity for human choriogonadotropin (hcg) and immunochemical detection of hcg-like factor in subcellular bacterial fractions.
AB  == investigations were done to determine whether vaccines prepared with chemically killed staphylococcus haemolyticus ru1 and streptococcus bovis av46 (bacteria that have been demonstrated to express human choriogonadotropin [hcg]-like material on their surface) elicited antibodies in rabbits with specificity for hcg determinants. in addition, the anatomical locus of the hcg-like factor was determined by separation of bacterial subcellular fractions. the results demonstrated that these bacterial vaccines elicited antibodies immunologically similar to those antibodies produced in response to the whole human trophoblastic hormone, a similarity extending even to cross-reactivity with human luteinizing hormone. the bacterial hcg-like material appeared to be localized in the membranes of the cell wall, and most was present in the soluble membranous and cytoplasmic constituents. its expression in bacteria was a strain characteristic  and not a species characteristic.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
