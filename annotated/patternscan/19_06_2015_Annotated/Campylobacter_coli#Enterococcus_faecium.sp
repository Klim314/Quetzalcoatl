TI  == analysis of in vitro and in vivo effects of probiotics against campylobacter spp.
AB  == campylobacter (c.) spp. are well recognised as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrheal disease worldwide, with c. jejuni and c. coli as the most important species: c. coli is highly abundant in pigs and pork meat has often been implicated as a source for human infection. intestinal colonisation of c. coli in pigs plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. different pre-harvest intervention measures are proposed to reduce the c. coli burden in the porcine intestine. among others, the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the colonisation of intestinal pathogens is discussed. one aim of this study was  to screen a variety of probiotics to evaluate their inhibitory activity against campylobacter spp. in vitro. therefore, cell-free culture supernatants of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus (e.) faecium ncimb 10415,  and escherichia coli nissle 1917 were tested against c. jejuni and c. coli by a well-diffusion agar assay. seven out of eleven lactobacillus strains showed an inhibitory activity against at least one of the three tested campylobacter strains. this antagonistic activity against campylobacter spp. was caused by the  production of organic acids that lowered the ph. application with ph neutralised  cell-free culture supernatants abolished this inhibitory effect. other tested strains with probiotic properties showed no inhibitory activity against any campylobacter spp. strain. the strain e. faecium ncimb 10415 was chosen to test its inhibitory activity against c. coli in vivo. twenty weaned piglets were allocated into two groups, a probiotic group and a control group.the diet of the  probiotic group was supplemented with e. faecium ncimb 10415 (10(9) cfu/kg feed,  cylactin) since weaning, whereas the control group received no probiotic treatment. all piglets were naturally colonised with c. coli. the excretion load  of c. coli was monitored for 28 days. the results indicate that dietary supplementation of e. faecium ncimb 10415 did not significantly affect c. coli excretion levels in pigs. in this study, e. faecium ncimb 10415 showed no antagonistic activity against c. coli in vitro and in vivo and had no impact on the growth performance of weaned piglets.

TI  == experimental study of the impact of antimicrobial treatments on campylobacter, enterococcus and pcr-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles of the gut microbiota of chickens.
AB  == an experiment was conducted to compare the impact of antimicrobial treatments on  the susceptibility of campylobacter, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, and on the diversity of broiler microbiota. specific-pathogen-free chickens were first orally inoculated with strains of campylobacter and enterococcus faecium. birds were then orally treated with recommended doses of oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim, amoxicillin or enrofloxacin. faecal samples were collected before, during and after antimicrobial treatment. the susceptibility of campylobacter, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated on supplemented or non-supplemented media was studied and pcr-capillary electrophoresis single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) profiles of the gut microbiota were analysed. enrofloxacin-resistant campylobacter were selected in the enrofloxacin-treated group and showed the thr86ile mutation in the gyra gene. acquisition of the teto gene in campylobacter coli isolates was significantly more frequent in birds given oxytetracycline. no  impact of amoxicillin treatment on the susceptibility of campylobacter could be detected. ampicillin- and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim-resistant enterococcus faecium were selected in amoxicillin-treated broilers, but no selection of the inoculated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium could be detected, although  it was also resistant to tetracycline and sulfadimethoxine/trimethoprim. pcr-ce-sscp revealed significant variations in a few peaks in treated birds as compared with non-treated chickens. in conclusion, antimicrobial treatments perturbed chicken gut microbiota, and certain antimicrobial treatments selected or co-selected resistant strains of campylobacter and enterococcus.

TI  == food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain.
AB  == wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain (n=41). salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% ci 0.61-16.91) and campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% ci 0.6-16.53) of the animals. e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni were not found. other thermophilic campylobacter were  moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% ci 8.82-34.87). additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by enterococcus faecalis (50%) and escherichia coli (10%). for the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. these findings pose a concern for public health, and thus,  further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.

TI  == retrospective analysis of salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and enterococcus in animal feed ingredients.
AB  == the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms in animal feed are not well understood. in this study, a total of 201 feed ingredient samples (animal byproducts, n=122; plant byproducts, n=79) were collected in 2002 and 2003 from representative rendering plants and the oilseed (or cereal grain) industry across the united states. the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of four bacterial genera (salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and enterococcus) were determined. salmonella isolates were further characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). none of the samples yielded campylobacter or e. coli o157:h7, whereas salmonella, generic e. coli, and enterococcus were present in 22.9%, 39.3%, and 86.6% of samples, respectively. a large percentage (47.8%) of salmonella-positive samples harbored two serovars, and the vast majority (88.4%)  of enterococcus isolates were e. faecium. animal byproducts had a significantly higher salmonella contamination rate (34.4%) than plant byproducts (5.1%) (p<0.05). among 74 salmonella isolates recovered, 27 serovars and 55 pfge patterns were identified; all were pan-susceptible to 17 antimicrobials tested. e. coli isolates (n=131) demonstrated similar susceptibility to these antimicrobials except for tetracycline (15.3% resistance), sulfamethoxazole (7.6%), streptomycin (4.6%), ampicillin (3.8%), and nalidixic acid (1.5%). enterococcus isolates (n=362) were also resistant to five of 17 antimicrobials tested, ranging from 1.1% to penicillin to 14.6% to tetracycline. resistance rates were generally higher among isolates recovered from animal byproducts. taken together, our findings suggest that diverse populations of salmonella, e. coli, and enterococcus are commonly present in animal feed ingredients, but antimicrobial resistance is not common. future large-scale studies to monitor these pathogenic and indicator organisms in feed commodities is warranted.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == effect of mannoproteins on the growth, gastrointestinal viability, and adherence  to caco-2 cells of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == yeast cell wall (ycw) preparations and yeast mannoprotein extracts have been effective against some enteropathogenic bacteria as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and salmonella, and they can affect the population of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, we studied the effect of a mannoprotein extract on five strains of lab. this extract was metabolised by the  bacteria, enhancing their survival in simulated gastrointestinal juice, and increasing the adherence of lactobacillus plantarum, l. salivarius, and enterococcus faecium to caco-2 cells. yeast mannoproteins are promising naturally occurring compounds that could be used to enhance lab intestinal populations and  control pathogens.

TI  == pan-european monitoring of susceptibility to human-use antimicrobial agents in enteric bacteria isolated from healthy food-producing animals.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli, salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus from cattle, pigs and chickens across  the european union (eu) using uniform methodology. methods: intestinal samples (1624) were taken at slaughter across five eu countries. bacteria were isolated in national laboratories, whilst mics were determined in a central laboratory for key antimicrobials used in human medicine. clinical resistance was based on clsi  breakpoints and decreased susceptibility based on european food safety authority  (efsa)/eucast epidemiological cut-off values. results: isolation rates were high  for e. coli (n=1540), low for salmonella (n=201) and intermediate for campylobacter (n=940) and enterococcus (n=786). for e. coli and salmonella, clinical resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but decreased susceptibility was apparent, particularly in chicken strains. resistance to older compounds (except gentamicin) was variable and higher. colistin resistance was absent for e. coli, but apparent for salmonella. for campylobacter jejuni, ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly prevalent for chickens, whereas clinical resistance and decreased susceptibility  to erythromycin was absent or very low. for campylobacter coli, resistance was notably higher. none of the enterococcus faecium strains was resistant to linezolid, but some were resistant to ampicillin or vancomycin. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was frequent. conclusions: resistance patterns varied widely depending on bacterial species, antibiotics, hosts and region. resistance  varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but clinical resistance to newer antibiotics used to treat foodborne disease in humans was generally very low. in the absence of resistance to newer compounds in e. coli and salmonella, the apparent decreased susceptibility should be monitored.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == diverse antimicrobial killing by enterococcus faecium e 50-52 bacteriocin.
AB  == an effective bacteriocin was identified and characterized. lactic acid bacteria were screened against campylobacter jejuni. one bacteriocin producer, enterococcus faecium (nrrl b-30746), was studied. the isolate was grown, and the  bacteriocin was purified to single-band homogeneity. biochemical traits indicated that the peptide was a class iia bacteriocin, and it was named e 50-52. the bacteriocin had a molecular weight of 3339.7 and an isoelectric point of 8.0. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of e 50-52 against c. jejuni, yersinia spp., salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella dysenteriae, morganella morganii, staphylococcus spp., and listeria spp. ranged from 0.025 to 32 microg/ml. in therapeutic broiler trials, oral treatment with e 50-52 reduced both c. jejuni and salmonella enteritidis by more than 100,000-fold in the ceca,  and systemic s. enteritidis was reduced in the liver and spleen. the wide range of antibacterial activity of bacteriocin e 50-52 against pathogens provides a promising alternative to antibiotics.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from swiss veal calves at slaughter.
AB  == bacteria with antimicrobial resistance can be transferred from animals to humans  and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. to determine the antimicrobial resistance situation in bacteria from swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. samples were cultured for escherichia coli, enterococcus sp. and campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. from 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of  the calves were collected by questionnaire. risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. in total, 467 e. coli, 413 enterococcus sp. and 202 campylobacter sp. were isolated. of those, 68.7%, 98.7% and 67.8%, respectively, were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobial agents. resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. however, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter sp. were detected. external calf purchase,  large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. participation in a  quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. the present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. to ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. by improving farm management and calf husbandry the prevalence of resistance may be reduced.

TI  == electrochemical detection of harmful algae and other microbial contaminants in coastal waters using hand-held biosensors.
AB  == standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. this study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster bacteroides and the esp gene of enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli  0157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). for k. brevis, two assay formats (rapid pcr-detect and hybrid pcr-detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for dna isolated from k. brevis culture and amplified by pcr.  sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect k. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the  electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). detection of k. brevis rna was also shown. multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated dna, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from new orleans, louisiana following hurricane katrina. furthermore, direct detection of  dinoflagellate and bacterial dna was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. the methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.

TI  == campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., verocytotoxic escherichia coli, and antibiotic resistance in indicator organisms in wild cervids.
AB  == faecal samples were collected, as part of the national health surveillance program for cervids (hop) in norway, from wild red deer, roe deer, moose and reindeer during ordinary hunting seasons from 2001 to 2003. samples from a total  of 618 animals were examined for verocytotoxic e. coli (vtec); 611 animals for salmonella and 324 animals for campylobacter. a total of 50 samples were cultivated from each cervid species in order to isolate the indicator bacterial species e. coli and enterococcus faecalis / e. faecium for antibiotic resistance  pattern studies. salmonella and the potentially human pathogenic verocytotoxic e. coli were not isolated, while campylobacter jejuni jejuni was found in one roe deer sample only. antibiotic resistance was found in 13 (7.3%) of the 179 e. coli isolates tested, eight of these being resistant against one type of antibiotic only. the proportion of resistant e. coli isolates was higher in wild reindeer (24%) than in the other cervids (2.2%). e. faecalis or e. faecium were isolated from 19 of the samples, none of these being reindeer. all the strains isolated were resistant against one (84%) or more (16%) antibiotics. a total of 14 e. faecalis-strains were resistant to virginiamycin only. the results indicate that  the cervid species studied do not constitute an important infectious reservoir for either the human pathogens or the antibiotic resistant microorganisms included in the study.

TI  == analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a japanese hospital.
AB  == prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) genes--tet(l), tet(m), tet(k), tet(o), tet(s), tet(t), and tet(u)--which are known to be distributed to  gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 enterococcus faecalis and 46 enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a japanese hospital. any of the tc(r) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. the tet(m) was detected at highest rates in both e. faecalis (75.0%) and e. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(l), which was harbored in 6.7% of e. faecalis isolates and 30.4%  of e. faecium isolates. the tet(o), tet(s), and tet(t) were detected in e. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(m), while tet(k) and tet(u) were not detected. nucleotide sequences of tet(s) from e. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in listeria monocytogenes. sequences of tet(o) from two e. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. the tet(t), which had been reported only in streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five e. faecalis strains. sequence of the enterococcal tet(t) differed from that of s. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). enterococcal strains with any one tc(r) gene or those with two tc(r) genes showed generally similar mics of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance  level was observed.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

AB  == from the crop and the caecum of swiss broilers slaughtered between november 1997  and january 1998, escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and  campylobacter species were isolated. after identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the e-test stripes and compared to those from studies in other european countries. all strains of enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), e. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n =  14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in  the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals.  e.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from finland and denmark, but lower than those in studies from italy and  germany. in staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. a high susceptibility of the 13 campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. these data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in switzerland.

AB  == qualitative tests are used to monitor antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of animal origin in the netherlands. quantitative information on trends in resistance is thus not obtained. moreover, in general a limited panel of antibiotics is tested. the present study describes resistance in zoonotic food-borne pathogens salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli o157 isolated from human clinical cases and from faeces of healthy food animals in 1998 and 1999, as determined with quantitative susceptibility tests. the resistance of the indicator organisms e. coli and enterococcus faecium isolated from faecal samples of broilers and pigs randomly sampled at slaughterhouses was  also determined. for this end, faecal samples from veal calves were sampled in 1996 and 1997 at the three main dutch veal calf slaughterhouses. in 1998 only a limited number of faecal samples of veal calves were taken at farms. for e. coli  and salmonella the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, doxycycline, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, carbadox, and flumequine. for e. faecium the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, streptomycin ('high level' > 2000 mg/ml), gentamicin ('high level' > 500 mg/ml), ciprofloxacin, bacitracin, flavofosfolipol, salinomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, virginiamycin, tilmicosin, avilamycin, and everninomycin. for campylobacter the following antibiotics were tested: erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, carbadox, flavofosfolipol, ciprofloxacin,  trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole.

TI  == resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in denmark: a baseline study for the danish integrated antimicrobial resistance monitoring programme (danmap).
AB  == this study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in denmark. the three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli/jejuni, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). a total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from october 1995 through december 1996 were tested for susceptibility  to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in denmark. bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found.  the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. in general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. the results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in denmark. thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in denmark.
AB  == this study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in denmark. resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator  bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). all antimicrobials used as growth promoters in denmark and some structurally related  therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. a total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during october 1995 to september 1996 were included in the study. acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. a frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin,  olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. the highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. the results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria  from food animals in denmark. they will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == observations on the control of campylobacter jejuni infection of poultry by 'competitive exclusion'.
AB  == various bacteria were isolated aerobically from caecal mucus of campylobacter-free broilers sampled at slaughter. the organisms were mainly presumptive coliform bacteria, enterococci and micrococcus/staphylococcus spp. none showed any inhibitory activity against campylobacter jejuni in a plate assay. on the other hand, adult hens yielded nine strains of escherichia coli and one strain of enterococcus faecium that were positive in the plate assay and most of which utilized mucin as an energy source. coliform bacteria with these properties were also isolated from samples of pig colon and faeces and associated environmental samples. all of the strains from chickens or pigs failed as separate mixtures to protect chicks against a challenge dose of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/bird of c. jejuni. by contrast, chicks dosed with anaerobic preparations of caecal mucus from campylobacter-free adult hens were partly protected against c.  jejuni, as shown by values for protection factor (mean log(10) of camplylobacters/g in caecal content of control chicks divided by corresponding mean for treated group). materials from three hens gave values of 7.3, 1.4 and 3.6, respectively.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
