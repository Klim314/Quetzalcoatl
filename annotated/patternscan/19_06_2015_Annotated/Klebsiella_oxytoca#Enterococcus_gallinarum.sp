TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. the propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. the addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first  experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). with rtq pcr detected species from the genus enterococcus were: e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus and from genus lactobacillus were: lactobacillus crispatus, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius. with maldi tof ms biotyper from enterobacteriaceae genera were identified citrobacter braakii, raoultella ornithinolytica, serratia fonticola, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. antimicrobial activities in vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. the best antimicrobial  effect of citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == chronic inflammatory state and chronic infections appear to be one of the most important risk factors of morbidity and mortality in patients (pts) on dialysis.  the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of urinary tract infections (uti) in clinically asymptomatic patients on capd. the study included 43 (22f, 21m) clinically stable asymptomatic capd patients with diuresis ranged from 300 to 2500 ml per 24 h. clean catch urine specimen, was cultured and identified by standard technique. urine from 31 patients had no significant organism growth, from 12 patients grew over 100,000 colonies per ml; 8 patients had been infected  with e. coli, 2 pts with proteus mirabilis, one with enterococcus gallinarum, one with klebsiella oxytocea. 7/12 infected pts were diabetic, 67% infected and 13% not infected pts had pyuria. conclusions: immune system disturbance and renal failure can predispose to common asymptomatic uti in capd pts. e. coli is the most common bacterial strain found in infected dialysis pts. diabetes mellitus is and additional predisposing factor for uti in patients on capd. pyuria is a valuable parameter of uti in capd patients.
