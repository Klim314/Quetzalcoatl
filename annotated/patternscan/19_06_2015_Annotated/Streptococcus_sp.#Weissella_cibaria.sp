TI  == monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. in this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the bacterial dgge profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were weissella cibaria (weissella confusa, weissella kimchii, weissella salipiscis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus iners, or streptococcus thermophilus), staphylococcus gallinarum (or staphylococcus xylosus), and staphylococcus kloosii. in addition to these bacteria, tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. the fungal dgge profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. in the mash, zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, candida etchellsii (or candida nodaensis) and candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. these results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. this is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of thailand.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. a total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on caco(3)-mrs agar plates. they were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as lactococcus garvieae,  streptococcus bovis, weissella cibaria, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum. freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of lab (less than 10 cfu/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)cfu/g. early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of lc. garvieae, s. bovis, and w. cibaria. at 48 h into fermentation, w. cibaria, p. pentosaceus, and lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. a mixture of these lab species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from indonesia reveals glucansucrase and fructansucrase genes in two different weissella confusa strains from soya.
AB  == homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been well studied in the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus and lactobacillus. this study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (gtf) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes from genomic dna of 'rare' indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing lab. from a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing lab isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. by comparing bacterial growth on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs)-sucrose with that on mrs-raffinose, and using the results of a previous pcr screening study with degenerate primer pairs  targeting the conserved catalytic domain of gtfs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of  both glucan and fructan (nine). here, we report the characteristics of three gtf  genes and one ftf gene obtained from weissella confusa strains mbf8-1 and mbf8-2. strain mbf8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfb of lactobacillus reuteri 121 and gtf180 of l. reuteri 180, respectively. strain mbf8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfkg3 of lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and dsrwc of weissella cibaria, and ftf levansucrase of l. reuteri 121, respectively.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria able to inhibit the in vitro formation of streptococcus mutans biofilm as well as the  in vivo formation of oral biofilm. two strains, cms1 and cms3, exhibiting profound inhibitory effects on the formation of s. mutans biofilm and the proliferation of s. mutans, were isolated from children's saliva and identified as weissella cibaria by 16s rdna sequencing. the water-soluble polymers produced  from sucrose by the w. cibaria isolates also inhibited the formation of s. mutans biofilm. according to the results of thin-layer chromatographic analysis, the hydrolysates of water-soluble polymers produced by the isolates were identical to those of dextran, forming mostly alpha-(1-6) glucose linkages. in the clinical study, the subjects mouthrinsed with a solution containing w. cibaria cms1 evidenced plaque index reduction of approximately 20.7% (p < 0.001). these results indicate that the w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit biofilm formation, both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == identification of enterococcal, streptococcal and weissella species in the faecal flora of individually owned dogs.
AB  == aims: to improve the limited information on the composition of the faecal gram-positive coccal flora of healthy dogs by the use of a molecular identification method. methods and results: faecal swabs were collected for the selective isolation of gram-positive coccal strains. colonies with enterococcal-  and streptococcal-like morphology were identified by trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr). fourteen known species belonging to three genera (enterococcus, streptococcus and weissella) and one alleged new enterococcal species were found. conclusions: the faecal flora of dogs comprises  an unusually broad diversity of culturable gram-positive coccal species with enterococcus faecalis being most frequently present followed by not less than six other species of about equal importance. significance and impact of the study: many human- and animal-associated enterococci and streptococci are also present in dog faeces together with the largely uncharacterized weissella cibaria and a group of strains resembling enterococcus dispar, but representing a distinct and  hitherto unknown species. phenotypic characteristics of the latter two species were determined and the test results were compared with the species descriptions  of w. cibaria and e. dispar respectively.
