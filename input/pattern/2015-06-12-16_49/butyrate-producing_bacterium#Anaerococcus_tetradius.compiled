TI  - Structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  - Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant. Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.
TI  - Proposal of the genera Anaerococcus gen. nov., Peptoniphilus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - Members of genus Peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence similarities. They were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. The reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new genera, Peptoniphilus gen. nov., Anaerococcus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov., is proposed. The genus Peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), Peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., Peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., Peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and Peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. The genus Anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species Anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), Anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., Anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., Anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., Anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and Anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. The genus Gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, Gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
TI  - Evaluation of a phenotypic scheme for identification of the 'butyrate-producing'  Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are isolated from approximately one quarter  of all infections involving anaerobic bacteria. However, studies of the significance of this group of pathogens have been hindered by an inadequate taxonomy and the lack of a valid identification scheme. In the present study, a phenotypic scheme for the identification of 'butyrate-producing' GPAC based on the analysis of volatile fatty acid profiles by gas-liquid chromatography, biochemical profiles (including the use of the rapid ID 32 A commercial kit) and carbohydrate fermentation reactions, was evaluated. The identity of 68 clinical isolates of GPAC was determined by application of the scheme published by Murdoch. The scheme was found to be easy to apply and only four of the test isolates could not be readily assigned to a species or well-defined group. The species most frequently identified in the test collection were Peptostreptoccoccus vaginalis, P. tetradius and the betaGAL group. A large number of strains was assigned to the heterogeneous 'prevotii/tetradius' group. Some species regarded as being restricted to particular clinical sites were shown to be more widespread than previously thought. The clinical source of the isolates did not show any consistent correlation with species identity.
TI  - The differentiation of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive cocci by protein electrophoresis.
AB  - Conventional biochemical and antibiotic sensitivity tests were used to allocate 87 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive cocci to currently recognised species, in comparison with type and other authentic reference strains. Whole-cell protein electrophoresis was then performed with extracts of each strain. Allowing for difficulties of standardisation, it was possible to allocate most of the organisms to species-related groups on the basis of protein patterns. Organisms identified conventionally as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. micros formed homogeneous groups by protein electrophoresis. There was evidence for heterogeneity amongst strains identified as P. asaccharolyticus (two groups, including P. indolicus), P. prevotii and P. magnus. However, aberrant P. prevotii strains were allocated to the P. asaccharolyticus groups, leaving a homogeneous P. prevotii group, and if P. variabilis were re-instated as a species, the remaining P. magnus strains could be divided into two groups. Of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci in the National Collection of Type Cultures deposited by Hare, Group IV is P. magnus, Group IX is P. micros and Groups I, III and VIII appear to be related to the butyrate-producing species P. asaccharolyticus and P. prevotii, but are strongly saccharolytic.
TI  - The laboratory identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - A collection of 256 clinical strains and 40 reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) was studied, to characterise the recognised species more fully and to define groups of strains which might correspond to previously undescribed species. The methods used were: gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) for the detection of volatile fatty acids (VFAs); determination of the pre-formed enzyme profile with a commercially available kit, ATB 32A; microscopic appearance; colonial morphology; and antibiotic sensitivity tests. Strains were placed in one of five VFA groups according to their GLC profile; 96% of strains were further assigned to 12 groups by their enzyme profile. There was less than 99% agreement between the two methods. Of 111 clinical strains in the VFA-negative group, 110 gave one of three distinct enzyme profiles corresponding to Peptostreptococcus magnus, P. micros and P. heliotrinreducens. The assignment of strains to groups based on their microscopic appearance and colonial morphology agreed well with groupings according to enzyme profile. Identification of butyrate-producing GPAC was unsatisfactory because it relied heavily on the enzyme profile; testing for indole production was of limited discriminative value. Most strains of P. asaccharolyticus and P. indolicus were very similar in enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and colonial morphology, but a sub-group of P. asaccharolyticus could be distinguished. A further indole-positive group corresponding to Hare group III was also noted. Strains of P. prevotii and P. tetradius were very similar, but easily distinguished from other butyrate-producing GPAC. However, 45% of the butyrate-producing cocci could not be assigned to recognised species; most of these were assigned to one of two new groups, the ADH group and the bGAL group, by their enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and smell. Four strains that produced a terminal VFA peak of isovaleric acid formed a new group designated 'ivoricus'. Reliable features for the identification of P. anaerobius were GLC (all GPAC that produced isocaproic acid were identified as P. anaerobius), enzyme profile and sensitivity to SPS. Two clinical strains that produced caproci acid were identified as Hare group VIII; they were distinguished from Peptococcus niger by their enzyme profile and colonial morphology. A phenotypic classification based on GLC and enzyme profile is presented, with a method for the identification of most strains of GPAC within 48 h of primary isolation.
TI  - Preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - The preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API. Both systems identified Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus, Ps. indolicus, Ps. magnus and Ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of Ps. magnus misidentified as Ps. micros by the RapID ANA system. The indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype API system, but the results with RapID ANA were often misleading. Eight strains of Hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. Four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. We conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. Problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.
TI  - Identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci by use of systems for detecting pre-formed enzymes.
AB  - Two systems for detecting pre-formed enzymes, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API, were compared in a blind study for their ability to identify 69 gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from clinical specimens. Both systems were able to identify Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus and Ps. micros accurately without the need for further tests. The prototype API system identified all isolates of Ps. magnus correctly, but the RapId ANA system misidentified several isolates as Ps. micros. Numerous different enzyme patterns were found with the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius), suggesting that this group of organisms may be heterogeneous. We conclude that kits for detecting preformed enzymes are of considerable potential for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci in clinical laboratories.
